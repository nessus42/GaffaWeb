[Regarding the Swans...]

&gt; Darn!  I'm so upset that they cancelled their Washington, DC show.
&gt; I just don't get enough abuse on a regular basis...

&gt; Maybe they could face-off against Red Lorry Yellow Lorry in a
&gt; snarlathon.

It wouldn't be any contest.  Red Lorry Yellow Lorry would jump in
their trucks and blue-shift away as fast as possible.  I'd rather
listen to Red Lorry Yellow Lorry, on a regular basis however.

But just to annoy you, Sue, I also saw Scraping Foetus off the Wheel a
short while ago.  He didn't cancel in Boston, and it was quite the
experience.  First he filled the *whole* Rat with hot fog.  I couldn't
see anything except my nose for the whole first song ... and Foetus was
only two feet away.  I couldn't breathe either.  And the lights along
with the fog turned the *whole* universe solid colors.  A red
universe.  Red everywhere.  Red up.  Red down.  Red inside my head.
Then yellow.  Then orange.  Then blue.  Then red.  Eventually the hot
fog dissipated enough so that I could see about two feet.  Which
revealed Jim Foetus weilding a baseball bat and drinking from a
bottle of yuppie spring water.  He was wearing a "Motorslug" (i.e.
Foetus and the guy from the Swans) T-shirt, which he eventually
removed, and leather pants which where unfastened and unzipped enough
to tell us that his red hair is probably natural.  He sang and performed
along to the "music", which was all on tape.  He kept beating up on
the guy next to me (I wasn't wearing an earing), and rolling around on
the ground, and climbing up on to the rafters, while screaming about
how women suck, or how Christians suck, or how *you* suck, or about
how he's going to kill you all.  All this time, I was being shoved
against the calf-high stage by the crowd, so I was in extreme pain,
which was very appropriate.

He only played for about half an hour, and the crowd nearly rioted when
he didn't do an encore.  I managed to grab the half-empty bottle of
spring water after he left, and gave it to a drooling fan.  I hope the
Karma will come back to me some day, and I'll get Kate's Coke can, or
something...

Before Foetus was Uzi, who were brilliant, as always.  Unfortunately
they just broke up.  One can hope that their already-recorded album
will still come out.

&gt; [Greg Earle:]

&gt; 	I just scanned through the 1985 Musical Archives.  Of all the
&gt; entries (over 150 LP's, 12", and 7"), only ONE (that's right, O N E)
&gt; was released by a major label (Art Of Noise "Legs" 12" on
&gt; Chrysalis).  I am conveniently considering Virgin a non-major,
&gt; although they sorta are.  MORAL: Support your LOCAL INDEPENDENT
&gt; Record emporium, down with corporate bullshit music!

Well good for you Greggie!  But I'd hardly consider any record company
which owns their own airline and a record store the size of a Sears to
be "independent".  But in any case, this attitude of "I'm only going
to buy stuff on independent labels" really pisses me off!  Support
*good* music, no matter what label it is on.  If everyone with good
taste boycotts major labels then major labels will never carry good
music.  It will be a self-fulfilling prophecy, and by not buying good
music on major labels, you will be actually helping to proliferate
junk, rather than helping to get rid of it.

(And what's this?  You didn't get HoL!)

And in regard to Joe Turner's friend in England who was at Comic
Relief: For someone who wasn't taking notes and who isn't a fan, he
sure managed to imagine some incredibly appropriate arrangements for
songs that weren't performed.
