Careful, you too may be trying to rip gaffa APART!  You
sarcastic humor bitch DemiGod, you!

&gt; &gt;it's a heavy issue that we can only get clear on by careful communication.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is why you are promptly buggering off to another mailing list.  I am
&gt; in awe of your logic.
 
It's awe-inspiring not only in it's contradiction, but by the
fact that Stev0, the Great Satan that he is, posted the basis
of what has become a "heavy issue"?  

&gt; &gt;(Of course, the people we're having problems with aren't careful readers,
&gt; &gt;so this will all be going over their heads, which will make them
&gt; &gt;uncomfortable and itchy-to-lash-back-dumbly.  That's some catch, that catch
&gt; &gt;22...)
&gt; 
&gt; Insult those who would disagree with you before they even get a chance to
&gt; rebut, hence invalidating their arguments before you see them.  Be
&gt; appreciative, friends, this is real courage we're seeing here.
 
Duh-h-h, 'scuze me, I go to blather a while, phhhhppppt. :-)

&gt; &gt;I'm realizing this morning that probably the "cut" between the 'Rudis' and
&gt; Despite the fact that I wish to wear neither the mantle of `Rudi' nor
&gt; `Homegrounder' I suspect that you have filed me firmly in the former camp.
&gt; However, I take great exception to the assumption that those who disagree
&gt; with you have no `personal artistic urges.' I myself have many such urges,
&gt; which I express by creating and exhibiting sculptures of Famous Presidential
&gt; Nose Cancers made entirely out of cat vomit.
 
Jon, do you need any material donations?  My cat Tulip throws
a hairball up every so often, I think this might be just the
textural medium you need.....

I myself am sculpting my mental impression of Ken Brownfield
(who is no doubt thrilled that I'm mentioning him) from the
neverending, always fresh supply of kitty dung that my fuzzy
friends provide.   It looks ... sorta like a big pile of kitty
dung.

&gt; Surely even a blockhead like you can see the fallacy in your logic.  You
&gt; have strung together two entirely unrelated premise in the vain hope that
&gt; nobody will notice.  That is generally known as a non sequitur.
&gt; Fortunately, I'm around to set the record straight for the miniscule portion
&gt; of the readership whose IQ is less than that of a doorknob.
 
"Blockhead"?  You .. you.... dick!  You LOCUST!  You
malignant!     

&gt; Pfft.  Making records is EASY.  You try getting up in front of a crowd and
&gt; performing live.  Now *that* is nerve-wracking.  Yes, I felt pride when I
&gt; finally wrapped my first tape, but it was nothing compared to the rush of
&gt; performing Shakespeare or playing in a band in front of a living, breathing
&gt; audience.
 
How true.  Though I'm sure making records can be
nerve-wracking, performing live _is_ a rush, a thrill and a
fright all at once.

&gt; What you are doing with your pathetic little spin-off mailing list is hand
&gt; crafting an audience of shills, ready to squeal in piggy delight at your
&gt; puerile pustules of pusillanimous prose.  You won't stand up in front of the
&gt; entire world and shout your theories to the heavens because you haven't got
&gt; the guts.
 
SOmebody censored my dictionary.  Ripped out all the damn
"P's" wouldncha know?  But I have a feeling what you jus sed
wuz ROOOOD!

&gt; I can't believe Stev0's comment about posting 11 year old interviews being a
&gt; trifle obsessive has come to this.  If it were me, I'd say, "yes, I am
&gt; totally obsessive" and get on with it.  If you actually had something
&gt; constructive to say about KT's music rather than this stream of empty babble
&gt; you've indulged in lately, you might find out just how hospitable the
&gt; love-hounds climate actually is.  But instead you say, "Oh, I can't EXPRESS
&gt; MYSELF here because someone might disagree with me.  I'd better start my own
&gt; mailing list, where I can cower from the wrath of the evil nasty
&gt; love-hounds."
 
Uh, yeah, it's a "heavy issue" ain't it?  

&gt; Run away with your flock of cowardly toadies.  I'll join your sick, fascist
&gt; regime the day my bones are found rotting in an Bulgarian convent!
&gt; 
&gt; I know you think that leaving will make me King Of The Desolation, but I'd
&gt; rather rule with the sinners than squirm with the saints any old day, if
&gt; you're any example of what canonization means.
 
Hee hee, Jon you are the baddest boy!  Well, this is gonna
have to go in along with a Richard Caldwell post in my Bestest
Most Funny Bestest and I Like It Bestest Posts Ever file.

I really do think Jorn went off the deep end on this one, but
hey, then again, there ain't much surprise in that is there?

Later,


Cynthia
Humorous Sarcastic DemiGoddess who'd trying to TEAR GAFFA
APART!!!!   AAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHH!!!!
