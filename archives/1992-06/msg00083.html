&gt; The reference to "ORGONON" is correctly spelled in the lyrics.  The song
&gt; "Cloudbusting" was inspired by the book "A Book of Dreams" by Peter
&gt; Reich, son of Dr. Wilhelm Reich -an early colleage of Freud and psycho-
&gt; biologist from Austria.  In the mid-40's, W. Reich moved to the U.S. and
&gt; began researching a possible cure for cancer based on what he termed
&gt; "Orgone Energy" or life energy.  The term "Orgone" (in English, I don't
&gt; know what he called it in German) is derived from the english word for
&gt; "Orgasm" which (being a student of Freud had something to do with this)
&gt; is where he origionally believed this energy came from.
&gt; 
&gt; To make a long story short, his work with this energy led to certain
&gt; very promising weather control experiments and attracted the attention
&gt; of the U.S. government.  The government, at first very interested,
&gt; became very disinterested very fast.  Soon after, the food and drug
&gt; administration (with a court order) ransacked his lab and destroyed a
&gt; great deal of his work.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, the name of the ranch where he lived, worked, and raised Peter
&gt; was "Orgonon."
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hope it helps,
&gt; James  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. - "A Book of Dreams" went back into publication about two years
&gt; ago, for those interested.

After reading the above post I went back and checked my records. The UK 
issue cd for HL lists OrgAnon in the liner notes as does the US issue CD, 
the US issue LP and the US promo marble vinyle LP. I also listened closely a 
number of times and she is (to my ears) most definetly saying OrgAnon. After 
I read "Book of Dreams" is when I first thought somethign was up for in 
there the place is called OrgOnon. So my question remains: is this simply a 
mistake in spelling on Kate's part OR did she actually mean something by 
this difference in the original OrgOnon and her rendition of OrgAnon?
