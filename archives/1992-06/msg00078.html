  First of all (flame coming, all weakhearted ingnore)

 I have tried to send this by private email numerous times but it keeps
bouncing so...., sorry for all of you who I'm sure I'll offend, but I
really need to say this to clear my conscience. 


      Cynthia Rosas:

         Grow up. Can you possibly ever post something about Kate or some
other intelligently related subject, as I thought was supposed to be the
purpose of this group, rather than constantly just pissing and moaning from
your own private pity-pot? I would like to think you (and a few others) are
mature, intelligent people with something worthwhile to say, but lately that
has not been the case. How 'bout proving to me and others that you still
have a Kate-related brain left?

   (Again, sorry to all of those whom I just offended. All the above is 
IMHO, of course, and I truly needed to say it. Hopefully, it'll be the last
time.) 

   Cynthia- if you need to flame at me, try to do so by private email as I
would've if it hadn't kept bouncing, so we don't waste gaffa space with our
bullshit. My address is judi@coyote.datalog.com.

    Anyway- ON TO KATE-GODDESS RELATED TOPICS! My question to all of you is:

what is your favorite picture of Kate, and why?

 My personal favorite is the photo from the cover of "The Whole Story". It's
so beautiful, warm, friendly, slightly impish, intelligent, gorgeous, and yes,
very, very sexy. (I guess being a female I can say that, huh?) If I could look
like any one person\picture on the face of the earth, that would be it. (With
color added, of course!) She really is a beautiful and classy lady.

                       judi (who, having needed to flame, and having flamed,
                                  hopes to move on....)
