&gt;&gt;b). Does anyone know whether the two CDs of B sides &amp;co from the box
&gt;&gt;    set are intended to be released separately in the future? I'd like
&gt;&gt;    to have them, but I'm not going to buy the box set when I already
&gt;&gt;    have the other six albums.
&gt;&gt;    (BTW, here in the UK, each individual CD costs #9; the box
&gt;&gt;    set is #105, which makes the B sides CDs #25 each !!)
&gt; 
&gt; We live in hope....

Well, I went to a record convention today, and hope is here, for a small (huh)
price.  I saw TWW #1 on sale there for a mere $22...I guess someone broke up
the boxed set for the sake of capitalism.  I also saw at the same stand the
rest of the CD's, although I didn't note the price.  would be interesting to
see how much the boxed set would have totaled up to...they didn't have #2,
though (not as interesting, IMHO, as #1).  No plans to release them separately,
though, so i'd try record conventions and other dishonest retailers.

On the note of the convention, I also saw three video tape compilations of kate
stuff.  I picked up the one including the saturday night live appearance, which
I am anxiously awaiting watching it with Meredith. (ah, the things I do for
kate companionship...i'm abstaining from it until wednesday, when she's done
with finals) but one of the other tapes included my favorite mis-kate so
far..."there goes a teacher".  Now that sounds like an appropriate anthem for
finals week!  Anyone have any better ones?

btw, i also picked up the vinyl 7" of rocket man, including gatefold poster of
the oh-so-controversial-for-no-reason cover.  I was surprised -- here i was
expecting an interesting photo, and all i get is an untouched up pic from the
sensual world photo sessions.  surely we have better things to fight about,
love-hounds?!
