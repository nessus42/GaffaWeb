&gt;I have been reading rec.music.gaffa with some interest for a few months,
&gt;and would like to:
&gt;
&gt;* Find out whether this initial attempt to make contact gets through.
&gt;  So, could some kind soul out there post or email a reply?

Yep, got as far as here.

&gt;* Ask a few questions of those of you more knowledgable about KaTe
&gt;  than I am:
&gt;
&gt;a). About a year back I read a biography (presumably unauthorised)
&gt;    by someone called (I think) Kerry Ruby. What's the general view
&gt;    of this book? Is it regarded as fair and balanced? It seemed
&gt;    pretty much that way to me.

Hmmm. In general I suppose it's a reasonable biography, but the number
of typos, factual errors, regurgitated ridiculous rumours, and plain bad
English (my favourite is the bit that describes the airways [sic] being
jammed after Hello Earth was played on Miami Vice. "Airways" are things
that airliners fly along! 8^). It's quite hilarious in places - the bit
about KaTe having an affair with Peter Gabriel, and Del being in a
suicidal state, for instance...

&gt;b). Does anyone know whether the two CDs of B sides &amp;co from the box
&gt;    set are intended to be released separately in the future? I'd like
&gt;    to have them, but I'm not going to buy the box set when I already
&gt;    have the other six albums.
&gt;    (BTW, here in the UK, each individual CD costs #9; the box
&gt;    set is #105, which makes the B sides CDs #25 each !!)

We live in hope....

&gt;c). I'd like to FTP some stuff from wiretap.Spies.com, but can't
&gt;    find a machine that knows about it. Would it help if I knew
&gt;    the X25 address, and if so, can someone let me know what it is?
&gt;    Any other routes that might help?

Umm, I don't think wiretap is on an X.25 network. Assuming it's on the
Internet it would help to have the IP address, but I don't think I've
got that. Anybody else?
