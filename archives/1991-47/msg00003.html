Andrew Marvick (IED) sez:
&gt;   In IED's view Kate's version of "Rocket Man", in large part because
&gt;of its lilting (but sporadic) reggae-cum-Celtic folk sections and Kate's
&gt;final, wordless minute of vocals, seemed (at first listen as much as at
&gt;the tenth) extraordinarily poignant and sad--an extremely sophisticated
&gt;and eloquent expression of the song's tragic subject.

i picked up the single (on vinyl no less) last weekend. in a sentence, i
like it. i'm not yet sure that i understand why people are put off by the
rootsy beat (aside from richard's feeling that it detracts from the lone-
liness of the lyrics) but i find it to be an interesting rendition of the
song nonetheless. but i must also admit that i am more inclined to react
to the music than anything else, so am not surprised about that since i
have not relly tuned into the lyrics. i agree with others though that her
voice isn't in top form by any rate. still, i like it. one thumb up (out
of two).

(incidentially, ied's comment about reggae-cum-celtic folk prods me to
comment that celtic-based music is *very* easily portable into other styles.
for example, the canadian duo bourne and macleod rather successfully bring
celtic instruments into a cajun setting. i find that there is something,
ah, fundamental, i guess, about celtic music that is easily meldable into
other styles and vice versa...perhaps that is why the music doesn't bother
me as much - then again, i am also enjoy roots music....)

as for "candle in the wind", i find it rather cheesy with those synths
and the electric piano. this song just lends itself to solo accompianment
with a *real* piano. again, i find KaTe's voice far from up to snuff on 
this one as well. the instrumental is really annoying since we don't have
her voice to distract you from the cheese. one thumb down out of two.

&gt;   Has anyone else noticed that the typographical error (of "Villean"
&gt;for "Uillean" pipes) in the credits for "Rocket Man" has been corrected--

in case it has not been mentioned, it is still incorrect on the 12".

&gt;Does this correction
&gt;after the fact not suggest that Mercury probably did not invite Kate to
&gt;review the cover art before the design went to the presses; but that
&gt;they made the correction after Kate herself saw it in the first
&gt;pressings that went on sale last month?  If this is true, perhaps
&gt;Mercury did not invite Kate to suggest a cover design, either?

i dunno - it suggests to me that someone finally caught it - i would not
go as far as to say that it has anything to do with KaTe's review of the 
cover.
