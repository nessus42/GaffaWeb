   Picked up the British import CD of Rocket Man and Candle in the Wind last
Fri.  My opinions:  I like Rocket Man alot.  Candle in the Wind is very nice,
but just seems to be missing "something". The instrumental is just plain boring.I think she could've come up with something better. Also, her voice doesn't 
seem anywhere near up to snuff. She sounds somewhat girlish, as if her voice 
isn't matured, like she does in some of her very early work. Still, all in all,
it's KATE.....

   Also- the KaTefan I spoke to at the shop where I purchased the CD claims
that one of his most recent KBC newsletters states that KaTe says there is no
new project in the works, henceforth no new album and no tour. This is crap,
right?  If someone could give me the most recent info from KaTe concerning the
album and tour, along with the source, I'd GREATLY appreciate so I can set this
poor misguided dude straight! (sorry, I don't have access to the archives...or
I'd look it up myself!) 

   This fellow also claims that KaTe refuses to come to the States on tour-
EVER! I know she's not fond of flying or coming here, but really....

   He also went as far as to offer his opinion that She will NEVER do another
album- just the occassional duet (ie. Gabriel-style) or a tribute, such as
she did for "Two Rooms". Of course, I promptly had to set the guy straight and
tell him he was "full of it up to his eyeballs...."   If she quit her music
career, what would she do with herself? Marry Del, settle down, and start
ploopin' babies?  OOOOOOHHH, what a scary thought.......


             desperately wanting the new album we KNOW is coming,

                                            judi
