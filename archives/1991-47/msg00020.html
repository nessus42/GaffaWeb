Yes, Kate has released her singles,  and lots of love-hound are
howling. Contrary to the seeming majority opinion, I think that
both covers (I got the 7" beauty) are excellent.
	Let me start with Candle in the Wind. There's been complaints
about her voice, her instumentation, etc. I think that her voice
is fine, as fine as it was in the Sensual World. She expresses
all the emotion and feeling of the sadness that the song expresses.
The instrumentation is subtle and undominating, and furthermore
compliments Kate's voice nicely. I don't see the sin in using
synthesizers, only the abuse of synths, and in this case, the
synths are used rather poignantly in giving the song and overall
ethereal feel. The background vocals also compliment the main vocal
line well by enhancing the emotional power and impact of
the song -- coming in when needed and being absent when
it ought.
	As for Rocket Man, I have to agree with IED in that the song
is one of sadness. The begining is certainly testimony to this
and, though the major key can be deceiving, the rest of the song
follows the prelude in suit. I think the "reggae" beat is an
excellent idea in terms of updating this classic, and it certainly
isn't obstrusive. It is a wonderful addition to the song, and
after hearing it, I wonder how the song could have done without it.
The way she performs makes the song flow really well. We get the
full effect and the full range  of the climaxes and diminuation that 
make the song so interesting, and so touching.
Again, her singing is as good as it has been in recent years (though
I second the motion that she give up smoking, since her voice
is definitely more raspy than her younger self). I think that
the ethinic instrumentation gave the song her artistic stamp
while combining well with everything else. 
	About both songs, I have to say that I am glad that
she covered them as she did. She did it in a conventional
style that was not too conventional, and that kept
clear of the cliche. The covers showed her trademark
spark of inginuity, without going overboard in trying
to be different and creative (she didn't try geting
Bulgarian singers with helicopter sounds and weird voices
in the background).
	On a final point, I'd like to say something about
the cover. The cover actually, to me, strikes me as rather
strange. She's not really smiling or frowning, it has been
described as sad, but I think it is something that is
less easily pigeonholed. Though I can't say what I think
it conveys (it only strikes me as disturbing, since I can't figure
it out), I think it is decent cover for the single, though I cant say
that it is one of JC Bush's better works. The only reason she
looks old (as some say) is probably due to the fact that
in most of her pictures, her skin is so washed out, either by
makeup or lighting, that you don't often see though dimples
on each side of her mouth, or the lines around her eyes. If
you ever see the picture disk for This Woman's Work (I just
got that also), you'll see the same picture (or near same) except 
with higher contrast, and thus she looks younger. The
poster included with the 7" has one of her grinning slightly.
And I can't help but laugh a little every time I see it. I
can't explain why.


	All in all, she did a great job. I think that these
songs rank up there with Cloudbusting and Experiment IV, and
I wait with bated breath for her soon to be released album.
