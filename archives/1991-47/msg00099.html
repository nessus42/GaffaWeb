I am not MTARR@EAGLE.WESLEYAN.EDU.  I didn't say:
&gt;I heard "Candle In The Wind" today.  Twice- the first time the turntable
&gt;was running at about 47 rpm, and it sounded a little weird.  Unfortunately,
&gt;at the right speed it wasn't much better.

Whoa... Meredith denigrates Kate... Jon drops dead of shock... film at 11.

&gt;FYI, there's no noise on the 45, so it can't be a Del-induced screwup, can
&gt;it?  That way, the noise would be on the vinyl too.

You can hear it REALLY clearly on the instrumental version at around 0:57.
The buzzy synth sound goes totally distorto on you.  It's there on the vocal
version as well but the vocals mask it.

&gt;CitW?  Well, she tried.  I don't mind the synths, but I've always HATED electric
&gt;piano, and this time was no different.  If she's doing the new album on the
&gt;piano first like she claimed last year, couldn't she have hooked up the mike
&gt;to it and done it acoustic?

It's not even electric, it's sampled and sequenced on ye olde fairlight.  I
hate to say it, but I think the Fairlight, which was responsible for some of
the coolest sounds in musicdom, and a large part of the charm on The
Dreaming and Hounds Of Love, is now useless for anything other than
commercials and film scores.  Well, I really shouldn't say that, since
Stewart Copeland did a wonderful album of 99% fairlight music, but most of
the pieces on it were in fact scored for The Equalizer TV show.

Unfortunately, Kate seems content to load up "bright pop piano 1", "bombastic
pointless percussion 3" and "lame ass cliche disk 7" and run with it.  What
about those great sampled "ahhs" and weird twisty bleats that filled TD and
HoL?  Gone forever, I fear.  I remember all too vividly the article that
came out around the time of TSW where she said that ever since she upgraded
to a Series III she couldn't be bothered to learn how to program it.

She's stopped setting trends and is now content to follow them.  What a
bummer.
