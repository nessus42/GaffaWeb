Goddess it's been a while since I've been on!  Hello earth, good to see you
again.

Just a few thoughts from my end...

Rocket Man
------ ---
Well, I heard this when it first came out, and I still feel the same way. 
Reminds me of Disneyland's It's a Small World Ride, without any of the quality. 
Top 40 kitsch with a reggae rip off (a la Vanilla Ice and rap).  Why, oh why
did she do this?  Well, I just happen to have a suggestion...perhaps KaTe is
tired of being treated as a goddess, and wanted to prove to her fans that she
is fallible.  It's the only excuse (and I, as one of those worshipping fans
want desperately to find her an excuse -- it's not very easy, though.)

Enya
----
I just picked the new one up yesterday, and I love it.  I'd agree, it's not up
to Watermark, but she still sounds beautiful.  There's one song Ethudae (?)
which blew me away...mind you, this is all after only one listen while doing
homework, so it's susceptible to change.  Is there an Enya mailing list?  I'd
love to join it.

What I've been up to lately (it does relate to KaTe)
---- ---- ---- -- -- ------ --- ---- ------ -- -----
In my directing class, we had to direct a "live" video, that is, choreograph a
piece to music.  After much deliberation, I chose "There Goes a Tenner", just
because it's such a fun, straightforward song.  My video followed the plot line
somewhat closely, using a gang of people planning and executing a bank heist,
with one of them a little hesitant (the one who gets caught).  If I could ever
(yeah, right) direct KaTe in this, she would have played that role.  So, on the
day we were supposed to go up, my lead didn't show up.  I was the only one who
could play the role, so with 5 minutes to go, I was desperately trying to
remember her blocking.  I ended up playing (in my mind) KaTe's role, and had a
wonderful time doing it.  You never know what will happen with KaTe, do you?

Tour
----
Nothing to be said here, just wanted to catch your attention!  8-)

Other thoughts
----- --------
"second star on the right, straight on til morning", Rocket Man...hmm...has
KaTe ever been to Disneyland? (sorry, all floridians, but I'm a DisneyLAND
supremicist -- grew up right next to it)
