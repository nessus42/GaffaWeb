To kerry white:  The copy of the Prince's Rock Trust
I have was actually rented from a vid store and
copied for me, so, once upon a time, it must
have been commercially available.  Some hunting
in the racks might turn one up.  It's worth it because
even though Kate only gets one song, and some
other worthless types get two or three, she
does an excellent job of it and you get to see
her shine when the pressure is on and things
go wrong.  She's also quite beautiful in the bit.

It also includes the longest most boring speech
ever delivered by Bonnie Prince Charlie.  After this,
you will understand what he sees in Camilla.  Joan
Armatrading does a tune, they have a local contest
winner, and lots of Phil Collins' drum work.  The fretless
bass player (can't remember his name, but I think
he worked with Midge Ure once, although that
I can't confirm) is outstanding.

[Bryan Dongray]

Need an Apollo (actually, a Saturn V plus
assorted components)?  C'mon down
to Huntsville where they were designed
and tested, and hey, we have acres of
rockets just waiting to be photographed.
We even have a Saturn I (real flight vehicle)
standing on I-65 at the northern border to Alabama
just waiting for your VidCam.  While you're
at it, check into the adult season at 
Space Camp!  Get a leg up on the race
to get off the third rock from the sun.

Also, if you can't do the Vid?  Don't
Have the Cash?  Consider doing
VRML, virtual reality is the ticket!
All that's required is months and months
of your time and disk space.  I have
three Kate worlds ready, but waiting,
until they give me full animation!

Don't even consider it without at least
a 75mhz Pentium, a 1.2gb drive, 
16k of RAM and a graphics accelerator.
Oh, a copy of photoshop and a scanner
won't hurt either.
