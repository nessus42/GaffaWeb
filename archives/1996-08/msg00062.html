Greetings all...

I have an observation regarding my perceived differences between Kate 
Bush and Tori Amos...

[Please disregard if I am totally off base - I have only heard a
couple of Tori's tracks (didn't know who she was until this list)
and have been a Kate fan for several years now.  Here goes...]

While listening to the Cathy Demos (thanks again, Esther!) and then 
comparing them to the released tracks, it hit me that Kate's music is 
romantic.  Not that it is always sensual, erotic or such but that 
every track has a sense of romance - even the harsh, sad or rough 
ones.

Tori's music, or at least the bits that I have heard, seems to not 
have that aspect to it.  Not that I don't like it - I find that I 
enjoy her music quite a bit.  Her music can be thought provoking and 
insightful, and I do enjoy her musical style.  However, I haven't 
heard any tracks so far which strike me as romantic in lyric, vocal 
or instrumentation.

I can't define what is romantic to me or what is not - some things 
just strike me that way.  Also, it may be that I've listened to 
Kate's music for so long that I just identify her style as romantic 
and then compare others to it.  I dunno.

Anyway, that is my two cents on the subject.  Remember, you get what 
you pay for... &lt;GRIN&gt;

As a side note, I was recently listening to a Siouxsee and the 
Banshees tune titled... hmmm... I wrote it down, now where did I put 
it... Oh, here it is, "Kiss Them for Me" off of the album titled 
Superstition.  It hit me (ouch!) that this cut seems to be a logical 
extension of the Los Angeles based band Missing Persons.  Anyone else 
have this connection?

Peace, Love and Walk Naked,

chris
