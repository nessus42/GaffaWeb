The Tori Tapes are finally available!

Sorry It's taken me so long to finish the tapes, work has kept me pretty 
EXTREMELY busy lately but I'm finally done!

The quality is quite excellent, especially on the Vancouver show.  Since most 
requests were from people that wanted all songs from both shows, I am making 
both available on one set of two 90 minute tapes. 

Tape 1. Tori Amos Live in Seattle, 5/6/92 (includes Tori Live on KKND: three 
songs live on the air: Me and a Gun, Leather, Silent all These Years, plus 
about 15 minutes of interview with Tori)  The concert was at the Backstage. 
Includes every song from "Little Earthquakes" except Girl. Also included is 
Upside Down. Covers include Whole Lotta Love/Thank You and Smells like Teen 
Spirit.  A little distortion in the recording occasionally due to the dynamic 
range of Tori's voice.

Tape 2. Tori Amos Live in Vancouver, 5/7/92.  
The concert took place in at the Vancouver East Cultural Center.  The audience 
of about 200 was much more polite and attentive than in Seattle.   The set list 
 was exactly the same as the Seattle show.  The beginning of Little Earthquakes 
was cut off due to a technical error but the rest sounds fantastic.  Even has a 
tiny bit of stereo separation since the PA just had her voice and the piano was 
louder than her acoustic voice, and the PA was to my left and the piano to my 
right.

The copies are dubbed real-time from the master onto new Maxell XLII 90 minute 
tapes.  Since I do graphic design &amp; production for a living, I have also 
designed and printed a nice color cover for the tapes with a photo of Tori, 
liner notes, tape labels, etc.  

Cost for the set will be $9 (US funds).  This is NOT for profit, I am just 
passing on my material/postage costs. The tapes cost me $2.50 a piece and I 
figure postage would be about $4.  I would prefer money order or cashiers check 
but a check would be OK.  I would also maybe like to trade copies of the set 
for any Tori CD singles that I don't have (I only have the US version of 
Crucify).  And in particular, I'd love to get a copy of the YKTR CD.  I have 
already made arrangements with Jeff Lester for a trade for a Sarah McLachlan 
Live tape which he has already sent (thanks Jeff, your set will be in the mail 
ASAP).  I would also be interested in other rare Sarah stuff (CD singles or 
live tapes) or maybe a Happy Rhodes CD (have yet to hear her). If you are 
outside the US &amp; Canada, send email and I'll find out the postage costs.

If you want to get these at the best quality, you'd better act now.  I have 
made 10 copies of the set to accomodate the initial requests plus a few extras 
and I'd rather not play (or copy) my masters too many times before I get them 
onto DAT.  Any future requests for the tape will be dubbed from a copy until I 
get a DAT machine (someday... sigh).

See y'all,
  Maury

PS.  Let me know about any Katemas (sp?) celebrations in the NW.
