&gt; on a different note, i think it's sad how all of us have become afraid to
&gt; mention non-kate artists here on gaffa.  first the happy fans get run off, th
&gt; the tori fans.  and now, i see people hesitant to mention clannad and kd lang


I don't feel like I've been "run off" gaffa just because we have
a seperate Tori mailing list now.  I'm also not afraid
or hesitant to discuss other artists.  It just seems like I've
been spending all of my time on RDT because gaffa has been so
quiet.

kd lang is my third-favorite female vocalist.  Kate and Tori
rate first and second, respectively. I fell in love with Absolute
Torch and Twang on the first listen.  I didn't like Shadowland
and sent it on to Cynthia.  _Angel With a Lariat_ is good also
but it didn't grab me like AT&amp;T did.  I've listened to Ingenue
only a few times, but I'm learning to like it.  It's so 
different from all of her other work, and I have to get used to 
the new kd.

kd will be performing live in Columbus on Wednesday July 8.  I 
won't be able to go because we already have tickets to see
Warren Zevon on Monday July 6 and I can't take two evenings off
in the same week.  Besides, Richard doesn't care for kd, and I'm 
not comfortable going to a concert alone.

I put Jane Siberry's _The Walking_ in the CD player the other
night and couldn't even listen to all of the first song.  It
sounded _awful_ to me! I've always liked _No Borders Here_
better anyway, but I was surprised that my reaction to _TW_ was 
so immediate and so strong.  So, I put on Caterwaul's 
_Portent Hue_ and was happily singing along with Betsy. 
I absolutely loathed that CD when Richard first got it.  
He always tried to listen to it when I was out of the
house, but I've been converted now.  Hey, I wonder if that was 
the same day Cynthia/Vickie reappeared on gaffa?  :-)
