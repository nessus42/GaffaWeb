&gt;The rest of the album is also bitchen.  If the noise gets to you think about
&gt;what you thought of Kate's voice the first time.  An incidental thing that
&gt;impresses me is that, rather than just shit on everything like a lot of noisy
&gt;"alternative" bands, they really seem to be trying to construct something,
&gt;to say something.  Have they been reading a lot of Crowley and Reich?

Hah!  Why do you think they called themselves _____ YOUTH?  The guys like
HARDCORE, testestain, and however Untrendoi it is, you'll have to admit
most of the progentitors (and quite a few of their succesors) made EVERY
song MEAN something, and hopefully something important - tho' tempered
w/teen-age rage/rant this didn't sit too well w/ the illiterai - Now,
here comes Sonic Youth who say they like h-core (or at least Thurston does)
and do thrash at times - is it any wonder?  But they probably read Crowley
and Reich - New York is one of the few places you can find the Re/Search
line, huh?

re: Sav republic
&gt;Mood music, I guess, but not Windham-Hill style.  Hof' might even like this
&gt;album.

After your description, I don't think so.

&gt;I realize all the hep people already know this and look down their noses at me
&gt;for stating the obvious, but I must look like a hep person to someone and it's
&gt;for their edification that I say what I just said.

IF you're looking for peer approval, you came to the wrong place. [ insert
regular inflammatory remarks here] and furthermore your tastes in music
would make a Benidictine Monk shoot junk!

P.S. New Forced Exposure is out w/ int.'s w/ Butthole Surfers (the Amy
Carter story is included, Jimmy Carter has touched Gibby's dick by
proxy) and w/ Larry Wallis (anyone know the Pink Fairies?) and a Peach
of Imortallity Tour Diary (who?  ask wicinski) AND if that ain't enough,
Steve Albini writes a guide on how to be a social retard and Tesco
Vee smuggles a missive out of jail where he is serving time for speeding.
Tons of rec reviews/ video reviews / show reviews... overall seems
to be fading but where else can you find an interview with Hasil Adams?
(POB 1611, Waltham, MA - send 2.50)

P.P.S.  Hey, anyone think perhaps Wicinski and Karen Finley would make
       a great couple?
