Hi folks!  Your humble pseudo-moderator is back from vacation.
Actually, I've been back for a week, but I've been busy catching up at
work and all sorts of other stuff, so I haven't had much time to do
anything with Love-Hounds.  I'm presently cleaning out my mailbox, and
forwarding the articles to Love-Hounds that didn't get automatically
forwarded while I was away.

In the news, the British Comic Relief show, where Kate performed
"Breathing" and "Do Bears..." has been released on video tape.
Unfortunately, it is only on PAL as far as I know (which cannot be
played on U.S. VCR's).

Today's KTrivia: Did you know that Kate was the first choice for the
lead role in the movie *Pirate's of Penzance*?  Kate turned down the
offer, however, so they gave the role to Linda Rondstat.

For those who are still pondering why Andrew Marvick refers to himself
in the third person as IED, I have dragged this statement of last May
by him out of the Love-Hounds archives:

	Partly out of a feeling of empathy for such a means of
	justifying one's obsessions, I have chosen to adopt Reich's
	pedantic forms and ponderous style in dealing with the work of
	Kate Bush, since this kind of obsessive interest in another
	person's life and work is better disguised, I think, when
	couched in the dry-as-dust language of the Orgonotic scholar.

And there have been several requests on how to receive a Wayside
catalog.  If you want one, you should write to

	Wayside Records
	PO Box 6517
	Wheaton, MD  20906-0517
