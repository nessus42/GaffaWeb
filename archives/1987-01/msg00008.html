New Option and Sound Choice are in, so head for your local hep
record store. I haven't had time to look at everything yet. Sound
Choice reviewed Option in their zine reviews section, and raised some
points which I had been worried about too: more space devoted to trendy
groups, relatively un-alternative bands on the cover, and ads from
labels backed by major labels. While I have nothing against making
money and becoming a slick, trendy publication (well, maybe I do
about the latter), I just don't find Option that interesting anymore.
That LA Underground feature in the last issue was pathetic,
I thought.

Sound Choice has actually got *more* raw. This one has sloppy collage
things interspersed with the reviews, fairly crummy paper, and
ink coming off on your fingers. Tons of info and reviews (also an
interview with Chris Cutler), well worth the four month wait. If you
want nice paper and printing and trendy bands, buy Spin.

Of course Wiring Department still gives more value for your measly buck,
despite the emphasis on Bay area bands.

If you're interested in getting in touch with Warm Gun, whose mega-noise
cassette is reviewed in Sound Choice, be warned that the address
is no longer valid. Former netter Rod Kean, who pretty much IS the group,
has like yours truly moved away from West Lafayette IN. Contact me
for a new address.

The end of '86 has some sad news for the Urbana/Champaign alternative
music scene. We lost undoubtedly two of the premier industrial/noise
radio programs in the country. Sonic Incisions is structured around
killer theme sets. On one of the last shows, we had over an hour of
Swans, with readings of Gira's interviews and writings. For comic
relief, we had some Joy Division. The show is pretty diverse and has
also featured Peter Hamill retrospectives and long Stockhausen sets
backing readings from S&amp;M literature and the surrealists.

Volatile Brain Secretions is more focused on the industrial/hardcore/
post-punk scene. Unfortunately the radio station does not keep 
playlists, but Katherine, who did the show, recently sent me this
sample set:

Membranes		Everybody's going triple bad acid
Celibate Rifles		Darlinghurst confidential
Birthday Party		Dead song
Die Kreuzen		Counting cracks
Social Unrest		God in heaven
Band of Holy Joy	Drug Virgin
White Stains		Man created God
Whitehouse		We've got the power
Blackhouse		#11
			What do you know about me
etc.

As a small consolation, Proof of Utah moved here recently. Sigh.

Bill
