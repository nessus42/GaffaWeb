I is back, folks, and this is not bad grammar.

For those who asked about it, the article which
Kate wrote on The Dreaming, and which I posted
last week in three parts, was copied verbatim,
and was not abridged at all. The confusion arose
out of the computer-mail system's sequencing of
parts I, II and III in reverse order. Sorry, but
it's all there somewhere.

I will be just as happy to drop the Strad argument as
the rest of you, but remember that not everyone
thought it was terrifically boring -- Nancy actually
called it "interesting".

Thanks in the extreme to Mark for his posting of his
favourite KT interview, which I, for one, had not seen
before. Some very interesting details in it (such as the
news about Kate's childhood voice lessons) were much appreciated
at this end.

For those who have requested more reprints of KT interviews,
rejoice! I is shortly going to begin posting the richest, longest
and most important (because most revealing and uninhibited) of
all interviews with Kate printed to date: the Swales interview
of legendary fame. Keep posted.
"The Ultimate Melody", Arthur C. Clarke's short story,
is remembered with honor; but although
it does bear some relation to the theme of "Experiment IV", there is no
correlation between specific subject matters. Kate's film and song are
very particular, and seem to be drawn primarily from her own nightmare
and the French news story.
I, for one, has sometimes approached a state similar to
that suffered (or enjoyed) by Clarke's protagonist, while
listening to a loop-mix of "Under the Ivy", which, as all
L-Hs of course agree, remains the single greatest entity
in or out of real time (not to be confused with "X4" itself,
which, as all will heartily concur, firmly maintains its
coveted position as The Universe.

In answer to a recent request, I (this new self-reference
is really going to start bugging you guys, huh?) herewith
explains the deal with KT videos now commercially available.

1.) The earliest is the film of Kate's live show, called
"Kate Bush Live at the Hammersmith Odeon". This film
features twelve of the nearly thirty performances that
comprised most of Kate's live shows of 1979. It has
been shown on cable TV often in the States, and will
probably show up again. Most of the songs performed are
early works, and there is only some indication of the
"mature" Kate Bush in the film. Kate's early stuff, however, is
second in importance only to her later stuff! By which I means
that the very best performance of anything at all by anyone else on
earth is, necessarily, weak at best in comparison with this film.

The tracks included (not in this order) are, from memory:
"Moving", "Feel It", "Hammer Horror", "Wow", "Oh England, My Lionheart",
"James and the Cold Gun", "Wuthering Heights", "Violin", "Kite",
"Strange Phenomena", "Don't Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake" and
"In the Warm Room", I believes. (There may be a confusion here with
other songs that appeared in other films of the show.)

2.) "The Single File"
This is a compilation of the twelve "official" promotional films
and videos that Kate made from 1978 to 1983. These are:
"Wuthering Heights", "The Man With the Child in his Eyes",
"Hammer Horror", "Wow", "Them Heavy People", "Breathing", "Babooshka",
"Army Dreamers", "Sat In Your Lap", "The Dreaming", "There Goes
a Tenner", and "Suspended in Gaffa".

3.) "The Hair of the Hound" (NOT AVAILABLE IN NTSC (U.S.) FORMAT)
There are four official promotional films on this nineteen-minute
video, all obviously from the Hounds of Love album.
They are "Running Up That Hill", "Cloudbusting" (the uncut 7-minute
version, including one minute of music not available on vinyl),
"Hounds of Love" and "The Big Sky".

4.) "The Whole Story"
This includes most (not all) of the videos and films from "The Single
File", plus some later films. The listings are:
"Wuthering Heights" (the original vocal is used),
"Cloudbusting" (unedited again),
"Breathing", "Babooshka", "The Man With the Child in His Eyes",
"Wow", "Hounds of Love", "Running Up That Hill", "The Dreaming",
"Sat In Your Lap",  "Army Dreamers" and "Experiment IV".
NOTE: The U.S. version, which should become available this month,
is supposed to include "The Big Sky" film, as well; and this may
be included on the UK version, too, although this has not been made
clear at this end yet.

So if you want all of The Dreaming's videos you'd better get
"The Single File" -- it's available on NTSC only as a Japanese
import; try Intergalactic Garage or Break-Through for a copy,
at a high price. If it's the more recent Hounds of Love stuff
you want, wait for the new "Whole Story" video. The best
solution, of course, is to buy everything, and to start
collecting the hours and hours of bootleg Kate video, too.
The official promos are just the tip of the iceberg!
