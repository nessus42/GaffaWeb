<PRE>
Well, IED attended, at Mr. Traynor's
request, Henry Rollins's performance
on UCLA campus last night. Rollins was very
funny. IED doesn't wish to take anything
away from Rollins -- he was very funny.

So what's the big deal?

Your description of yourselves did not
reach me until after the event, but you
must have been blind to all but your idol
Mr. R. not to have spotted IED, who was
wearing the badge of God and the Holy
Raiment of the 1985 Romford Convention, and
standing where anyone could witness these
True and Only Signs of God.
By the way, wasn't that black feminist
poetess who was on before Rollins
TERRIBLE?

Oh, if someone was sending
messages to IED yesterday and getting
no replies to them (someone named
Jeremy, maybe?), that's because it
wasn't IED himself who was receiving the
messages. IED's account is used by someone
else, as well, and he had no idea what the
messages meant, so ignored them. Sorry.
Please try again.

To Jonathan Drukman:

It's very interesting that you suggest
making a track of just the rhythm section
of "Sat In Your Lap".

First of all, let IED just say that he
didn't mean to imply that "Sat In Your Lap"
-- or any other Kate Bush track, for that matter --
wouldn't be magnificent in an extended form.
In fact, IED has for several years been making
extended home mixes of her records, and two of them
are of "Sat In Your Lap". One was a forty-five
minute loop, alternating between the LP and seven-inch
mixes. The other, interestingly enough, incorporated
the solo rhythm section of the record (about which you fantasize)
taken off the "Looking Good, Feeling Fit" TV appearance by
Kate (UK TV), in which she was shown dancing in a studio
to the drum track (without the other music). Of course,
the sound is absolutely terrible, but it still sounds
amazing.

IED's only objection earlier was to the idea that
Kate's original was FLAWED by being compressed into three minutes
and some odd seconds' length. It may be more satisfying to some
listeners to hear a longer version, but that's their affair, and
has nothing to do with the success of the original.

To Sue T:
Sorry, IED no longer has that old stuff in his files, and
can't really remember the details. However, as he recalls,
all he did was voice sympathy for your ill treatment at other
l-hs' hands, and suggest that you not just disappear. By "former
tone", he meant that your (apparently) sudden announcement of
concession and departure from the scene indicated that you had
been unduly upset, and this seemed an unfortunate shift in tone.
OF COURSE you have never been abusive yourself -- never had such a
notion.
Sorry for any misunderstanding.
