I was a lookin' at the current Rolling Stones charts and there are
a couple o' peculiar things in 'em.  Fer instance, Skinny Puppy's
"Dig It" at number 10 on the dance chart.  Is Skinny Puppy really
this popular?  Do many people in disco's really like industrial
noise?  Maybe disco's are the place to hang out these days....  The
chart says underneath it that it comes from Rockpool, however.
Why is Rolling Stone getting it's dance chart from a college radio
journal?

Rolling Stone also says that *The Whole Story* is at 34, which a lot
different than Billboard's listing of 106!

Run D.M.C.'s album is now double platinum.  Who woulda thought!  I
should have seen them a year ago when they played a little club
in Boston, huh?    Oh, well.

I saw Throwing Muses again last night.  Last time I saw them, I payed
$5, saw three other bands: one as good, and one nearly as good.  I
was close enough to have them sweat on me and there were maybe fifty
people there.  The time before that their were 20 people and they
opened for Roger Miller.  Now that they are big and famous, I got
to pay $7 to see them with no other band, and be jammed in this huge
throng of more than a thousand people and barely able to see.  Sigh.
They played better than ever, tho.
