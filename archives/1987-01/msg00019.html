whaat?
novay.. les SONICs != la Republic
/////
	at best they both got some loose droning guitar sounds once in a
	while, but SONIK Y'TH are far more powerfull sounding than
	SAVAGE REPUBLIC.  S.R. on CEREMONIAL got too much of the 'teen-ager'
	feel to be taken all that seriously on side 1... but side 2
	(instrumental) is really something else!
	Even though it's a fairly commercial/'just rock'n'roll' sound
	- and "nice" to boot - it's really got some mood without
	the foul yuppie aftertaste... (side 1 really could have done without
	a lot of the vocals.. pitty really ... but give side 2 a listen
	if you get the chance... you might find it well worthwhile)
	I usually prefer to listen to TRUDGE than CEREMONIAL though..
	TRUDGE (S.R.) is less mainstream. More ambient.No teenage vocals.
	Just as moody. More floating and skew notes. Less "nice"
	in the traditional sense of "nice" music.
	(note... only one 7 minute track on one of the sides.)

what else..
some old stuff 'recently' aquired..

SONIC YOUTH / Bad Moon Rising
	Needs no comment. Speaks for itself. Easily some of my favourite
	sounds to have come from the states over the past while or two.

KONSTRUKTIVITS
	I think this is what what's his name from psychic t.v. went on
	to do. Not bad. Some of it made me think of what old ambient CHROME
	would have done in a reflective mood and some spare electronics..
	(what ever that means.._).. although any percussion is far sparser
	than the thundering sounds of "Half Machine Lip Moves" and 
	"Alien Soundtracks"/CHROME... (btw.. two of the best early noize
	albumns ever!)... this is going nowhere,why do i bother.
	
"AN AFFLICTED MAN'S MUSICA BOX"
	Easily the best thing on this compilation, I found,
	was an industial/classical piece by a guy called Jacques Berrocqual
	(.. can't really remember the correct spelling). 'would certainly
	appreciate it if anyone knows of more of his work, particularly more
	of the strings sounds.(wasn't all that impressed by the scattered
	percussion at the start and end)
	Nurse With Wound track I thought was really weak (although I'm
	not fond of a lot of their early work).
	Same goes for the Foetus &amp; AMM stuff on this albumn.(boring..)

"EXORCIST SOUNDTRACK"
	Some interesting stuff on this if you're into sounds.
	Intense ambience perhaps? Even the version of tubular bells
	is tenfold more bearable than Moldfield's.
	A great islam style vocal track too.

PRETENDERS(?!)/"DANCE"
	B side of some charts single a while ago. Although I normally can't
	stand the pretenders, I absolutely ate the drum and guitar sounds
	on this little gem. (track's on their latest albumn too, but I wouldn't
	be surprised to find it's the only track with any bite).
	Great punchy pop/ nothing more/ nothing less.

LAURIE ANDERSON/ Mr. Heartbreak
	Finally bought a copy / SO SHOULD YOU.



########################

	I'm hungry. I'm missing lunch.
	"Thank god(?) this life is the only one"

ps. saw SPK "live" in Melbourne a while ago.
	They performed most of their "Songs of the Byz'ne".
	Two people tamely banging some bottles and pipes the occasional african
	drum to a heep of taped sound doesn't do a whole lot 
	for stage presentation. Lot's of tape hiss. Average-good video
	screened on two players.. mmm, well maybe..
	Interesting (chinese) live vocals though, even 'good' when some
	of the pace/volume picked up, but overall a bit pretentious and
	disappointing. (perhaps not for live performances this one?)

ppspsp:  New Lustmord 's been out a while, anyone heard it yet?
