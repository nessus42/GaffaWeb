i ventured into the city of baltimore with reverend jim to
a good young punk show.  g.i. was billed, but unfortunately
they had some sort of accident in new york.  jim, i forget
all the band names, so you review them.  what was that place
called too?  someone got shot outside the place.  just a 
bunch of nice kids.

after quite a bit of persuasive talking, in order to gain
use of the quintessential family car, on a night that was
declared a snow emergency, i finally headed into d.c. to
the 9:30 club.  tim and entourage were to appear.  bands
scheduled were pussy galore and big black.  i didn't really
connect with pussy galore, except for a small portion of the
tunes.  i didn't know if it was them or me, but my head was
working up a powerful hurt.  i thought they could be really
great if they got better drum stuff.  too much clanking for
my tastes.  big black was pretty cranking.  i still felt
like hell but it was much easier to get into the sound.
hey, one of the guys in the band looks just like earle.
i mean it, and i didn't have any beer either.  i ran into
someone from elementary school -- freaked her out...  i
took my tempterature when i got home:  101, ugh.  hope
everyone's ok.

boston's always cool cuz i can get into all the shows free like.
we ended up at scumratties (how i pronounce it) to check out
the royal pimps (son of nesmith, grandson of the liquid paper
empire, plays guitar).  first we were subjected to run21.
luckily is was the tail portion.  nothing like bad glam rock
that should've died long ago.  royal pimps sucked too.  really
bad stuff.  that's all i'm gonna say about it.
