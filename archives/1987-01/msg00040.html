   On the subject of vocal range ... I believe that Annie Haslam's
range is more like 5 octaves (as opposed to 8 octaves, as earlier
posted). I saw Annie in a TV show where they actually had her go
through the octaves and I don't believe she could quite hit that fifth
octave, though she does have quite an amazing range (a guitar only has
~3.5 octaves, I'm not sure about a Stradivarius or a banjo).  She
needed some help from the band to get the right notes, since she's not
formally trained in music.  BTW, it is ironic that she was kicked out
of a choir when she was young.  I believe that Annie has a hearing
problem and she basically used to outscream the whole choir.  Finally
(and not to belabor the point), 8 octaves is quite a bit folks ... a
piano only has 7+ octaves! ... if Annie could hit 20 kHz (which I
couldn't hear, but some of you might), then she would have to reach as
low as 20000/(2**8) or 78 Hz, and that's LOOOHWWW.  Kate's range?  My
poorly educated guess would be somewhat greater than 3 octaves (maybe
as much as 4 octaves).

   Other topics ... congrats to IED for showing that he can use the
first person (I know some of you will say he just did a global
substitute of "I" for "he", but that's just sour grapes), now let's
work on the verbs a little.  As far as what IED stands for ... this
seems to get some people irate and I for one fail to understand why.
If the man wants to call himself the King of Prussia who the f*ck
cares?  It really doesn't make any difference and it certainly doesn't
hurt anyone.  Use of the third person doesn't make his points any less
valid; he's willing to stand for and defend his points and
(occasionally) has been know to take some points back.  And while he
is a fanatic about Kate, he doesn't mind if you think she sucks or
believe that listening to her music is hazardous to your eardrums, as
long as you state that thats your belief and not a categorical
statement!  Maybe we can put the whole subject to rest by holding a
"What IED stands for" contest.  We could all submit our entries and
let IED choose the best entry [IED: I hope you don't decide to
electronically impale me for suggesting this; I think it'd be fun; my
own entry: "I Envy Doug"].

   Soon to come ... answers to the Kate Trivia posting of n months ago.
