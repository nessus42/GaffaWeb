I too am still shocked at CD prices. But I think I understand what going
on, and will explain shortly.

I was in Cambridge on 12-29 and managed to find 'The Whole Story' on CD
in BCD. It was in the $19-$20 range, but I bought it anyway, die-hard
KT fan that I am.  What puzzles me much more is the fact that every
record store I'd been in up to that time had told me 'It's not released
yet.'  And this was after I'd heard other people on this net saying they
had already gotten it. So I knew it 'was' released.  Anyway, I noticed
a Made In England sticker on the back of the case.  So it's an import.
Probably.  And had a higher price. I don't think all record dealers
charge THAT much more for imports; I got the impression that BCD was
pricey, but can't fault their selection, which was excellent. It remains
the only place I've seen 'The Whole Story'.  Anyway, I suspect the reason
that it I was told it was un-released, is because it IS unreleased...
domestically.

Which brings me to another story. Rumor really. One of my friends
works at one of the two current CD plants in the US.  The laws of
supply and demand still hold... I can hear the thoughts of the CD
producers now. 'If you don't like the price I charge for making a CD,
where will you go?  There's only one other place in the US that makes
these, and they're charging as much as we do.'

All of which is due to change in the next 6 months to a year. My friends
company is gearing up production of CD 'stamping' machines and expects
to get a major share of that market.  He told me to expect 40 to 60
CD plants in production by the end of '87 and it's probable that CD
prices will be dropping to reasonable levels by mid-summer.  So maybe

there is light at the end of the tunnel.

With regard to the violin, banjo, drum debate I only have the following
to say: 'Que es mas macho, pineapple o knife?' ***
