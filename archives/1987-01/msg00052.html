Someone mentioned that the British music scene is dormant because melody
maker and the face said so:

False!  The Mekons are presumably reforming! The Sound is reissuing
some old 7"'s (this is rumor)!  The Membranes have a fine album out
though I chafe at the term "Pop Noise"!  People tell me HEad Of David
is great!  What about the Godfathers?!  The lion is finally ROARING
again instead of whimpering... more names:  Whitehouse, The June 
Brides...

Re: "Sid And Nancy"

Blah.  Go see "Traci Who?" instead... a synopsis: the year is 1991.  Ed Meese
is president and his Sex Police have set up cameras in the bed
rooms across the U.S.A. to see what Americans are up to.  The Sex
Police (a male and female) stay off screen but offer some of the
best commentary of fuggin' an' suggin' this side of Fireside Theater.
Good cunnilingus techniques herein but alas, Timbo, no Traci Lords or
Vanessa Del Rio (who collectively could kick the shit out of Lydia
Lurch).  Available in adult sections of viddie stores anywhere...

Re: The Volcano Suns "All Night Lotus Party" originally entitled "The Volcano
Suns smoke pot and listen to the Grateful Dead" (the original title).

Good record - for more Grateful stuff in that vein check out Christmas (Big
Time), Pontiac Brothers (Frontier) and Expando Brain (features Steve
Smith of Salem 66 on guitar - 6$ ppd. to box 2187, empire state
plaza station, albany, ny, 12220).

Tim, you lie.  Crass hates your guts.

&gt;&gt; then a blue police box appears and a funny fellow with a teenager in
&gt;&gt; tow jumps out holding a sonic screwdriver on kate as she withers
&gt;&gt; into a little ball...

&gt;fine but have the "teenager in tow" turn out to be Kate in a short
&gt;blond wig who gives another wink as she and the Doctor get back into
&gt;the tardis.

'Kay... wonder if Kate would allow us to script a video for her like
Madonna did on MTV.

Speaking of fan-induced creativity - I've finished my version of 
"Running Up That Hill" - already a "hit" at area Tupperware parties - ask
|&gt;oug about the "Monster Meat Mix" I gave to him.  Greg Taylor, start
polling that mailbox...

&gt;were You at the 1986 PHIL-CON?
No, but I was on the guest list.

Re: Penn &amp; Teller.

Yeah, I understand Penn is seen at alot of the New York gigs and refers
to himself as a "punk" magician pitting himself against the "hippy"
magicians like Doug Whathisface and David "Yuppie" Copperfield.  HE 
constantly derides the "hippy" magicians for using special effects on
TV to complete their magic.  Strange, how these sociological divisions
affect all sectors of entertainment eventually.
