&gt;the world is:  Anyone know if the other 12" from INFECTED have other non-LP
&gt;tracks on them?  (ie: are they therefore worth buying?)

"The THE THE INFECTED singles", he stuttered:

"Heartland", the first single from the album, has two tunes on the
flip side.  One is "Flesh and Bones", which was also on the Some
Bizarre compilation IF YOU CAN'T PLEASE YOURSELF YOU CAN'T PLEASE
YOUR SOUL.  It sounds like it's from the same sessions that produced
INFECTED and is worth owning.  Typical Matt Johnson lyric from
the tune - "I jumped out of bed, had my first cigarette.  It made
my body feel weak but helped my mind relax".  The other tune is
called "Born in the New S.A." and is a short, instrumental, not
very exciting tune.  Neat cover art by Johnson's brother, who now
calls himself Andy Dog, shows a cyclops gentleman with a union jack
for an eye, crying into his beer.

The second single is "Infected" and is three versions of that tune:
the B-side versions are called "Skull Crusher Mix" and "Energy Mix".
Worth owning?  "Ehhhh", says I, making a shrugging gesture.  Go ahead,
it's only money.  Another neat cover by Andy.  All the cover art since
"Soul Mining" is by him, and there is more in the INFECTED videos.

Third single is "Slow Train to Dawn".  The B-side of that has probably
the best tunes of all these flip sides, with "The Nature of Virtue" and
"Harbour Lights".  Again, typical Matt Johnson lyric in "TNoV" - "Don't
change yourself to suit everybody else".  This single comes with a THE THE
stencil so you can take it and a can of spray paint and desecrate your
town with the name of Matt's band.  Kids, don't try this at home!

The newest single is "Sweet Bird of Truth".  It starts with the same
fighter pilot radio chatter as the album version, then three explosions
(of the requested napalm) then Johnson reciting his "3 o'clock in the
morning,...E-I-E-I-Adios" bit.  There is also African chanting in this
version.  Libyan, probably.  The B-side of this is sub-titled "Themes from
'The Nightwatchman'".  It has the same version of "Harbour Lights" that's
on STTD, and another good instrumental tune called "Sleeping Juice",
which sounds like it comes from the BURNING BLUE SOUL days. 

Another B-side worth having is on the "Uncertain Smile" single.  There are
two tunes that both sound like they came from the BURNING BLUE SOUL era.
They are "Three Orange Kisses from Kazan" and "Waitin' for the Upturn".
The latter has some neat flute and sax bits in it.  And the A-side is a
10 minute version of "Uncertain Smile"!

When is this guy going to tour?

&gt;--Jon Drukman
&gt;"How can anyone know me when I don't even know myself?"

-Dan Hall, ardent THE THE fan, who hopes he never gets as grouchy as
 Matt Johnson always seems to be.  Makes for good music, though.

"You smile and think how much you've changed.  All the money in the
 world couldn't buy back those days"
