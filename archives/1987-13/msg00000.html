&gt;[Legendary Pink Dots] didn't play, nor will they ever play in the U.S.

I'm sure I just saw a flyer of theirs at Idols here in Rochester.  (I
think I'm still in the U.S.)

Well, in my quest for more Kate, I went out and bought The Kick Inside
yesterday.  After two listenings I rate it third of my three KT albums
(The Dreaming and Hounds of Love), but you can never judge an album
until at least five concentrated listenings.

I have a couple of questions concerning this album.  First, I remember
quite a while back (at least a couple of years ago) I saw a KT
performance on USA.  At the time I was unfamiliar with any of her
material, but now after hearing TKI, I recognize that almost all the
songs from that performance were from this record.  Was that the tour
for TKI?  Next, on the back cover notes of the album it says "sleeve
design by Kate Bush".  Mine was simply a white paper sleeve (I always
wondered who came up with that popular design), but seriously, what was
on the original sleeve?  Also, the copy I have is the 'Kate on a kite in
an eye' cover.  Is there any significance to this release?  I've heard
it mentioned a few times here in gaffa.

I also bought No Man is Hurting Me by Roger Miller.  Not as powerful as
Birdsongs, but interesting and worthwhile just the same.  He'll be here
on the 9th--stay tuned for a review.

	[The tour was for *The Kick Inside* and *Lionheart*.  The
	credit for "sleeve design" is probably for the record cover.
	As far as I am aware, *The Kick Inside* never came with a
	special inner sleeve.  The "Kate on a kite" cover is notable
	because it is the original cover (which is still on current
	British pressings).  For some reason, however, foreign
	pressings of the albums almost always use a different cover
	that is selected by the record company in that country.
