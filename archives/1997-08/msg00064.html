First of all, whoever posted the five good Kate songs for a rainy morning:
Wonderful!  I cannot express how accurately you chose your choices.  I can so
easily envision all of those songs fitting the mood of a rainy morning, despite
the fact that it was sunny here in West Hartford, CT.  Moving on ... I have so
very much enjoyed the posts of people's "other favorites."  Diamanda Galas and
Jane Siberry (I really need to get around to checking her out) are the two I'll
be looking for first.  Kate, Kate, Kate ... I've been thinking about a lot of
things.  First of all, I don't think anyone should complain about the length of
time between albums.  HOWEVER, the fact that I'm a relatively new fan could
make it easier for me to wait, because I've only played the albums for a year
now.  Second, it's so interesting to me to see the comments about The Sensual
World that surface from time to time.  I mean, it seems like one of those
albums that is by no means a favorite of the artist in question, but
definitely has its devoted supporters.  Kind of like the soap opera One Life To
Live: it's not loved by the masses like Days of Our Lives or General Hospital,
but it has its true fans.  I'm also reminded of a post I wrote last fall,
defending LIONHEART.  It's so nice that even the lesser-loved albums have their
fans.  Finally, I have never really gotten a sense of which version of
"Wuthering Heights" is more popular.  Being that this is my favorite Kate tune,
not to mention one of my favorite novels of all time, I'd like to know what
people think.  So long for now .... Shane
