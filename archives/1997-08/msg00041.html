<PRE>
I like many others have read the letter from Krys with great interest
and appreciation. I think all the points she makes about things like
touring, press relationship and personal contacts with fans are all
very valid. There is still one thing I want to add some comments to,
and that's the communication between Kate and us (= the fans).
In the beginning of her career there was the Newsletter, which appeared
quite regularly. After a while the periods between these started getting
bigger and bigger until they got almost as big as the periods between 
the albums. I think at this moment her last written statement to the
world dates back from 1995.
In these modern times there are many possible forms of communication.
Kate is described again &amp; again by people who know her well as a very
introvert person who loves her privacy. I think this form (some sort of
written statement to the fans) is probably the only one - apart from the
music itself of course - that holds almost no threat to that privacy.
So what if she feels she has nothing of any interest to say to us?
I tend to think that does not really matter that much. For example, if
some day when opening the mail from this list we would suddenly see that
one of the messages was sent by KATE BUSH, I suppose all our hearts 
would skip at least one beat. If the message would read nothing but
"Hello Everybody" I think most of us would still feel very happy.
I think Kris has done a great job in trying to explain Kate's feelings
about it all to us, but we are like little children : we want to hear it
in her own words.
So, to make it quite clear - I definitely do NOT think Kate owes us fans
anything at all; but I do feel that a very small effort from her side
could take away a lot of this "SHE DOESN'T CARE ANY MORE" crap.
I am absolutely sure, knowing her only through her music, that Kate is
a truly kind person - the more she shows it, the better. To echo one of
the sentiments in Kris's letter : please Kate, don't leave us behind
with all of the Oasises in this world!

Albert
