Hi Ron and everybody else,

&gt;    I was wondering,  what's the inspiration behind the NfE album cover?
&gt;We see all these animals and gnomes coming out from under Kate's dress.
&gt;What's the meaning of this?    And why all the bats?  Even Kate is costumed
&gt;as a bat on the back cover.     Her dress on the front cover has a cloud
&gt;pattern....

Well, in an interview that I have on disc she says it's about all the
different emotions we can have. We can be a black bat at one time, and a
white dove at another. These emotions are created by ourselves and sort of
'go through' us, like a whirling wind. Something like that anyway...

While I am at it...

About these long periods of time between albums: it's silly to think she
doesn't care about her public when she keeps us waiting that long, because
it's something she herself isn't happy about as well.

Both after the Sensual World and the Red Shoes (and after some other ones as
well, I think) she has said that each time she didn't mean to spend so much
time on 'just an album'. Being the perfectionist she is, however, she can
only do things if she can do them right. That way of working costs her some
years of her life (and of ours), BUT we get a masterpiece each time.
I mean, look what happened when they only gave her some months. The result
was Lionheart, which is the most unpopular of her albums (not with me, I
love it very much). It's the album she (and a lot of us) are most
unsatisfied with.

Regards,

Richard
