&gt;
&gt;Well, it's not that the line isn't positive towards gay people;  it's that
&gt;the line is a reference to a not-very-nice human being who just happens to
&gt;be gay.  I don't see that line as being anti-gay any more than somebody
&gt;making a comment about a casting director "screwing every gal who hits the
&gt;couch" is anti-straight.  People in show business ARE known for using their
&gt;positions to abuse people sexually, and the gay fellow in "Wow" is no
&gt;exception.  It's sort of odd to me that people would question this when the
&gt;tables are turned and it's a gay man, yet they probably wouldn't question
&gt;it if it were a reference to a straight guy taking advantage of women.  Now
&gt;*there's* a double standard for ya

I dunno..I also never thought that Kate was slagging off this particular
gay bloke but she was singing *as* somebody who is slagging off the gay
bloke or the gay theatrical stereotype.

I feel that the line about vaseline is what the producers and directors et
all think about  gays in the theatre business.  She 'plays' those people in
the song.

Dave

BTW i don't know if anyone has thought of this but....isn't the word "wow"
quite a distasteful joke about anal sex.  Should I go into detail?  I dunno
if that was at all in Kate's mind though when naming the song.  Probably
reading too much into this........
