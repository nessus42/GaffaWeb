To all those who think Kate owes them an album:

Get a life.  

Kate is under no obligation to provide us with anything.  Our 
capitalist system provides a balance . . . Kate's recordings in 
exchange for money.  I don't owe her my life for having bought all of 
her records, and she doesn't owe me hers for having created them.

Certainly I have a bond with this woman because of the beautiful music 
she has recorded, and it is because of this that I don't publicly 
pester her about when she is releasing more of it.  Sure, I want it 
NOW, but that's life.  Moaning about it won't help.

Putting aside for a moment the realities of the music industry . . . 
Kate is an artist.  Her art is far from formulaic.  Coordinating 
musicians with various exotic instruments to conform to the deep, dark 
mysteries of her genius can't be easy or quick.  And she might want to 
do things like eat, sleep, travel, read, and of course keep in shape 
so the busybody fans don't freak out if she doesn't weigh the same at 
40 as she did at 17.

Sorry if this sounds bitchy, folks, but will you PLEASE LEAVE THE 
WOMAN ALONE.  She doesn't owe you anything.  She has a life outside of 
her career, and probably wishes the rest of us would follow suit. 


Matt  (aka "Stock")
