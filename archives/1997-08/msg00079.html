In answer to Ronald Girardin re Never for Ever

Three parts to this, I think

1. The back cover is almost a pure rip-off of Del's painting for the back 
cover of TKI. A bit whimsical, a bit sill, but I really like it. - mocking 
up a photograph of a painting

2. from memory, the bat outfit was first used to promote "Breatthing". I 
think it was the french single which used a b/w shot from this on the cover? 
(Or was it the french version which reversed the black and white of the 
standard mushroom? - Can't remember - all my Kate records were nicked about 
10 years ago, and I've never had the heart to build up a "definitive 
collection" again. Sob. But I digress.)

3. Kate talked quite a lot about the main Nick Price drawings when the album 
first came out. The idea was that the creatures represented the emotions, 
thoughts and other inputs which went into forming the songs. Some were pure 
and wholesome, others had a darker side. The sunny clouds on the dress and 
the starry background continue this idea. Kate herself is represented in 
quite an "innocent waif" mode. She acknowledged in one interview that having 
the good and evil forces coming from under her skirt represented that there 
was a sexual element and sexual need at play.

This split of good and evil appears a few times on the album. Innocent 
bride/gun toting crazy in the Wedding List.  Sexuality/prudery in Babooshka 
(the video especially). Quite literally birth and death in Breathing. And 
then the bloody rose on the inside, which - of course - is where you find 
the "KT".

I love it.

While we're on this album - anyone worked out all the bvs to "Delius"?  I 
assume they're in Latin? Syphillis seems to come into it sonewhere (which I 
think is what Delius died from?)
