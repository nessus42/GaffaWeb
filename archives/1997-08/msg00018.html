I don't know how anyone else feels about kate being in "hiding" all the
time, but I think it's great that she's not always in the publics eye.  I
don't believe that was ever her intention from the beginning.  She didn't
want to be another pin-up for the pop world.  She's not a media whore and
I that is something to be respected.  I think I would shit twice and die
if I ever saw her hosting some fucked up MTV game/sex show.   She does
what she does in a time span that she's apparently comfortable with, and
we as fans should respect that.  When we start becoming demanding of
albums and appearences and tours, is when we should just take a step back.
 I appreciate her music more than any other artist because she seems to be
the only one left who does it because she enjoys doing it, not because she
wants to sell 100 million albums.  
I think the gap between TSW and TRS was probably due to the loss of her
mother. She's obviously from a very close nit family and it was probalbly
a very difficult time.   I for one probably would have been bored of her
if she released an album every year.   As far as a tour, I think the only
reason she even considers touring is because of pressure and flack from
fans.  Maybe we should all just sit back and be thankful that she wasn't
some 15 minutes of famer.  She's been around for 20 years, and she has
brought comfort to a lot of people through her music.  She's truly gifted.
 She is a rare breed.  She does what she wants to, and instead of
complaining about it, we should respect it.  

Best Wishes,
