<PRE>
I have been following the "A Fan's Dissapointment" thread since I
figured out that Netscape's mail app works with the new digest format,
but a very busy personal life has kept me from penning the definitive
answer to those whiners that feel that they are owed something.  Then
Krys' wonderfully written article found it's way to my mailbox.

Thanks Krys!  You said many of the things that I had been thinking while
reading recent postings.  I was lucky enough to be watching Saturday
Night Live those many years ago, and old enough to realize that I had
just witnessed something special.  Being on the wrong side of the
Atlantic to hear Kate on the radio and see her on television again, I
thought that I possessed this wonderful secret that no one else could
quite understand.  Maybe being President and sole member of this Club of
One helped build up Kate in my mind to something more than just a
wonderfully talented yet shy artist.  Over the years I have gone from
fanatic, to fan, person with a full life who still really enjoys Kate's
music.  Am I the same person that I was 18 1/2 years ago? No.  Is Kate?
Doubt it.

She has given me (and the world) around 100 pieces of music and 20 or so
videos, many of which I use to identify and remember key points in my
life.  Music has always been important to me, and I am constantly
looking for something new and interesting.  I sing along with the
Prodigy, The Verve Pipe and Garbage, while others I grew up with cling
to The Eagles and other bands that have not put out new music since the
Reagan administration.  Only one artist from my youth still holds a very
special place in my heart - Kate.  I listened to the Dreaming a few days
ago, and it still sounds as fresh as the day it came out.  I would be
hard pressed to name more that a handful of pop musicians I grew up with
that are still putting out anything interesting, and fewer still that
had any impact on my life.  Does it make Kate special?  Yeah - I really
think it does.

Finally - to the point of all this.  If Kate were to decide today that
she has said everything that she has to say musically or otherwise, I
would offer up a thousand thanks for all she has given, and cherish each
note that she has produced.  Whether her next album takes another two
years, or disappears into oblivion like the book she was supposedly
writing a few years back, it will have no effect on my admiration of
both Kate and her music.  She has paid me anything she "owes" me many,
many, many times over.

Thanks Krys, for a beautiful post, and thank you Kate for such a
wonderful catalog of magic.
