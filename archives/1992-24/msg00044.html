okay, this has been really bothering me.  i spoke to somebody at katemas in
boston about housing in boston for a friend who's moving there, and now i have
absolutely no idea who it was.  so if you have a room for rent in boston, or
know of one, or are just looking to be helpful, please contact me about it.  a
very close friend of mine is needing a place to live for next year.  he's an
mit grad student (working in the ai lab) who went to harvard before.  he's
extremely responsible, friendly, and just a great guy with a fantastic
personality.  and hey, i'll eventually even come up and visit, and hence meet
you.  (hmm...maybe i should take that part out -- it might be a deterrent.) 
:-)  he needs a place in the next few weeks, so please contact me as soon as
possible.  i think he wants to spend $350 - $400/mo., although anything that's
near a student's budget would be fine.  send me e-mail, and i'll relay the info
to him and put you two in touch with one another.  he's currently in maryland,
so he doesn't have net access right now, although soon he will.

Once again:  contact me (valerie nozick) at
	     vnozick@eagle.wesleyan.edu
	     2212 oakawana rd.
	     atlanta, ga 30345
if you know about a room for rent in boston/cambridge/anything nearby for a 22
year old male grad student.

Spy...**

ObKaTe:  When i was in new jersey, i went to have dinner with a mormon
friend/neighbor of mine who was on her mission.  due to the regulations of
people on their missions, we had to have dinner with her two companions as well
(they can't spend any time away from one another -- stupid rule, imho, but i
guess that's how they keep them away from the men and unmarried.)  i wasn't
looking forward to this, needless to say.  so i planned on having kate playing
in my car to maybe introduce them to her and to brag about my excellent taste
in music.  :-)  sure enough, as soon as we got on the road to the tunes of the
ninth wave, one of the companions asks who is singing.  when i reply that it's
kate, all three of them mention how much they liked the sensual world.  take
heart, kate fans -- we really are making progress in the united states!

BTW, this story is completely and happily true.  think she'll ever play byu?
