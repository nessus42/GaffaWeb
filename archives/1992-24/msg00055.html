Friends,

Just couldn't let this one slip by...

Valerie (VNOZICK@EAGLE.WESLEYAN.EDU) pontificates :-) :

&gt;ObKaTe:  When i was in new jersey, i went to have dinner with a mormon
&gt;friend/neighbor of mine who was on her mission.  due to the regulations of
&gt;people on their missions,we had to have dinner with her two companions as well
&gt;(they can't spend any time away from one another -- stupid rule, imho, but i
&gt;guess that's how they keep them away from the men and unmarried.)  i wasn't


I probably wouldn't have said anything, but the "imho" called to me.
Having serving a mission for the mormon church I would be more than happy
to tell you why that "stupid rule" exists.


&gt;looking forward to this, needless to say.  so i planned on having kate playing
&gt;in my car to maybe introduce them to her and to brag about my excellent taste
&gt;in music.  :-)  sure enough, as soon as we got on the road to the tunes of the


Yes you do have very good taste in music...


&gt;ninth wave, one of the companions asks who is singing.  when i reply that it's
&gt;kate, all three of them mention how much they liked the sensual world.  take
&gt;heart, kate fans -- we really are making progress in the united states!


Oh, ouch!  If I were more paranoid than I am I would think you were making
sweeping generalizations about mormons :-).  I personally enjoy a wide variety 
of music beyond the Mormon Tabernacle Choir :-) :-).  I am 
a devout KaTe fan (my wife would say "religious") as well as many others
discussed here, ie:  Sarah McLachlan, Tori Amos, even a little Jane's 
Addiction, most of which are available EVEN in Utah :-).


&gt;
&gt;BTW, this story is completely and happily true.  think she'll ever play byu?


I swore never to return to BYU, but for that I would make an exception.

BTW, please note the great number of grin faces as to show just a little
ribbing intended (We mormons are a kind and gentle lot).
