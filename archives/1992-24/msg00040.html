        I'm a little drunk, but hopefully this makes sense. 

        This is gonna sound strange, but when I was watching an add for 
Pet Cemetary last night, the young actor (the same guy that was in 
TERMINATOR II) seemed to have what looked like a Kate Bush symbol on 
his bacK!  I only saw it one, but it sure looked like it to me.  I've 
been watching for the commercial again, but haven't seen it.  I guess 
it could be a "knights templar" symbol, but I though that didn't have a 
circle and this sure did.  Course, I may be all wrong about this! 

        Scott - Kite as a drug song?  well in my current state at least 
it makes sense, especially given the recent revelations (to me at 
least) about Kate's early drug use in one of the interviews I just 
transcribed.  As far as the "girlie" mag, I thought I had read that it 
was John Carter Bush, but I may be wrong or just thinking of his 
poetry! ;-) 

        Thanks to everyone for the Peter Gabriel song info. 

        
        Jeff asked about discussion of Strange Phenomena.  There was 
that little bit, but I didn't really count it as it really didn't into 
the song very much

        Diamond asks about a biography on Kate.  Look at the book  
Cloudbusting in the archives (see below). 

        Scott asked about the Cloudbusting GIFs.  My originals 
(coverted from the Amiga) are all fine, but I have no way of checking 
the ones in the archives.  Oh, to actually have FTP. 

        Someone asks about the archives.  I'll repost the monthly post 
at the beginning of the month, but here is some info that may help. 

All past messages of rec.music.gaffa/love-hounds-digest can be ftp'd 
from the love-hounds archive at ftp.UU.NET [137.39.1.9] in 
/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/archives.  Song lyrics, interviews, the Garden 
and Cloudbusting, etc are in /usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb on the same 
host. 


If you've never used ftp, you use a program on your UNIX system called 
FTP. 
 You connect by typing: 
ftp ftp.UU.NET 
Log in as "anonymous", and use your username as your password. 
To change directories type: 
cd usenet/rec.music.gaffa 
"dir" will get you a directory, "get" and the filename will retrieve 
the file.  If you "cd" again into "archives" or "kb" you'll find the 
main goodies, with "pix" being another subdirectory within "kb", and 
"gif" and "gif.new" within "pix".  (When downloading gif's, set your 
transfer type to binary by typing 
binary 
at the "ftp&gt;" prompt.)
