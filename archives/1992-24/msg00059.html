Elibeth says on "Kite": 

&gt;       I can't say if drugs were actually in mind when the song was 
written,  
&gt;but from what I hear in interviews, etc, Kate seems to look more at 
universals 
&gt;and feelings than specific events , so this feels more 'right' to me. 
&gt;        
&gt;

        That's interesting, and I wouldn't doubt that it could be true. 
 

Dirk asks: 
 
&gt;A few years ago, I bought a limited edition interview picture disc of 
KaTe. 
&gt;It was released in 1987 in England and the number is KB 1011. 
&gt;The front side shows KaTe's smiling face, the back shows KaTe with a 
&gt;big double-bass. 
&gt;The record (12 inch, vinyl) is of a very poor sound quality as if the 
&gt;interview was given via telephone. 
&gt; 
&gt;My questions: 
&gt;1. Who made the interview? 
&gt;2. Is the record a collector's item and valuable? 
&gt;3. Is the interview transcribed in the archive? 
&gt; 
&gt;Thanks in advance for any information. 
&gt; 
&gt;


        I don't have any bootlegs (just tapes made off of them) and 
interviews are often repeated on different boots, so I always get the 
various boots confused.  In any case, I believe that all of the boots 
are transcribed and in the archive (chopped up) in Cloudbusting - Kate 
Bush In Her Own Words.  If you want to see the un-edited interview, it 
would be in THE GARDEN in (I think) the file GARDEN08.  Info on getting 
these files will be in the monthly post, which I'll post on the first 
of the month. 
        I believe the one you have is a "fake" interview, where the 
interviewer used on of those "open-ended" interviews and simply put his 
voice in to make it seem like Kate was really there (I could be wrong 
about this).  If you'd like me to send you the specific transcription 
of it, post the first question and answer so I can figure out which one 
it is. 


Stuart says: 
 
&gt; 
&gt;STRANGE PHENOMENA 
&gt;First song showing Kate's "mystical" bent. Not one of the more 
&gt;memorable songs on the album, musically, though. I've always wondered 
&gt;what does "Om mani padme" mean?  
 

Since this was brought up by another person, here's some quotes.


*       IF YOU COULD TELL ME WHAT "OM MANI PADME HUM" MEANS. 
        Well, it's a buddist chant actually, and I couldn't actually 
tell you what it means because unfortunately I don't practice Buddhism. 
 But it's a passion mantra, and it's really just a mediative - blah - 
chant that people use when they're in a state of higher being.   (1979, 
Personal Call)

        IN "STRANGE PHENOMENA," WHAT DO THE WORDS "OM MANI PADME HUM" 
MEAN?
        Club member Matthew Toreson has sent in an explanation, which 
he found in an encyclopedia.  It is a form of adoration of the Buddha, 
and means, "Oh, the jewel in the lotus." Thanks, Matthew.   (1979, KBC 
1) 

        IN "STRANGE PHENOMENA" YOU SING "G ARRIVES" WHO OR WHAT IS "G"?
        "G" is in fact someone we know called Mr. G.   (1980, KBC 5)

AND SOME STUFF FROM THE ARCHIVES (NOW IN DEEPER UNDERSTANDING).

Subject: Om Mani Padme Hum

Ah!  Finally a topic I can contribute about...

Although I personally recite "Om mani padme hum" 108 times each morning
as part of my Buddhist thing, I scarcely remember wondering about its 
literal meaning.  "Hail to the Jewel in the Lotus" is probably right, 
but hearing it referred to gives you a chance to muse on more than its
translation...

It is the personal mantra, according to the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan
Buddhism, of Chenresig, the Goddess of Compassion.  She/he is also
known by the names Avaloketisvara towards India and Kuan-Yin towards
China.  Since the rise in Tibet of the Gelugpa sect around the 15th 
century, and since the Dalai Lama is recognised as one of the living
incarnations of Chenresig, "Om mani padme hum" is the national mantra
of Tibet.  Travelers there find it on prayer wheels, prayer flags,
and painted or carved on mountainsides near towns.

I have our beloved KaTe to thank for hearing its correct pronounciation
for the very first time...
