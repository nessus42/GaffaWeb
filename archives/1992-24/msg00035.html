        _Kate_Bush_Live_at_the_London_Palladium_1979_  (1988) is a 
3-record set from what looks like the same old New Yorkers.  On this 
album they go by a name they deserve, "Pharting Pharoah Records". The 
album design is particularly noxious: on the front cover it features 
the famous (and copyrighted) photograph of Kate with ivy in her hair; 
and on the back, a collage mixing official photographs taken from music 
magazines (including the KBC Newsletter) with shots from the nude photo 
session of "'lookalike' Kate Simmons" which originally appeared in a 
Autumn 1982 U.K. edition of _Penthouse_ Magazine.  As IED understands 
it, the photos and story appeared in the UK edition of _Penthouse_ 
only; and the article was filled with teasing insinuations that left 
the reader in little doubt they were supposed to think it was Kate 
("young doctor's daughter from Kent"; "been composing since she was a 
child"; etc.)
        As for the use of one of those photos on a bootleg LP cover, it 
doesn't surprise IED at all. There's zero evidence that the people who 
make KT boots are fans. That's highly unlikely, in fact. In the first 
place, any real fan would do a much better job of organizing the 
tracks, listing the titles correctly (there are no fewer than eight 
mistakes on the cover of the three-record set), etc. And in the second 
place, a real fan wouldn't even sell a bootleg in the first place!
        However, there is no reason that IED can see for doubting the 
authenticity of this album's contents. All 24 songs from the Tour of 
Life concerts are included (spread over three records), as well as 
virtually all of the "incidental" music and poetry/prose readings, 
readings, chants, etc. (The Bristol bootleg, in its recent vinyl 
incarnation, manages to fit roughly the same amount of material into 
two records, but who's counting?)  The sound of the Palladium set is no 
better than you'd expect, but the source does
sound different from those of any of the other albums. As a result, it 
seems relatively safe to accept that this set originated from the 
London Palladium.

     _Temple_of_Truth_ is to be _avoided_ unless you are so devoted a 
fan that you must have any Kate item no matter what its quality. 
_Temple_of_Truth_ is simply an excerpt from an unidentified (and 
unidentifiable) Tour of Life concert (a different show then the other 
bootlegs). The sound of the recording is the _worst_ of any of the 
several live concert bootlegs of Kate's Tour of Life, and it doesn't 
even contain half the programme. The sound is easily recognizable, 
because the sound on this record has a peculiar way of coming in and 
out of "focus" in a cyclical pattern, rather like a shortwave radio 
station, except that the sound changes in tone rather than in level of 
distortion. Do not buy this album.
        The LP is a single record, with a purple cover that features a 
strange photograph of what might be a small, ancient lighthouse or 
something, sitting on a precipice overlooking the sea. No explanation 
is given for the choice in cover art, and there are no liner notes or 
track listings. In fact, not even
the source of the material is identified.


        If_You_Could_See_Me_Fly_ (1988) (NOT to be confused with the CD 
of the same name) is a single lp containing excerpts from the Bill 
Duffield concert from 1979, features Steve Harley and Peter Gabriel 
(organized to benefit Duffy's family following his death early in the 
tour). Also included two early demos of "Babooshka" and _Let_It_Be_ 
from the Amnesty show.
        The quality of the Hammersmith material is marginal.  The 
Amnesty show track is better, but not great.  The two studio takes of 
"Babooshka" are pretty good, though they crackle as if they had been 
lifted off another vinyl disc.
        This is a European pressing and has a black, white, and gold 
cover with a composite photo of a Fred &amp; Ginger like pair dancing on a 
typewriter keyboard.
        The tracks and credits are listed as shown below.  Recorded

        _Live_in_Japan_ (1989) is a seven-inch single featuring (on the 
a-side) Kate's live performance of _Moving_ from the Seventh Tokyo Song 
Festival, which was held at the Budokan on June 18, 1978. On the b-side 
are Kate's performances of abridged versions of two Beatles songs, 
_The_Long_and_Winding_Road_ and _She's_Leaving_Home_. The latter two 
songs were taped at Tokyo's TBS G Studio on June 23, 1978, for airing 
on the programme _Sound_in_S_. All three songs are accompanied by a 
large orchestral group (including full string and wind sections), and 
for _She's_Leaving_Home_ Kate pre-recorded her own background choruses.
     The sound is surprisingly good, and is in stereo (although it may 
be simply a stereo recording of the original mono tracks). There is a 
good deal of "toppiness" to the sound (distortion of the higher 
frequencies), but for the most part the recordings are quite 
listenable.
     The cover is of hard, glossy card-stock, with a close-up copy of a 
1978 publicity shot of Kate on the front, and a copy of the close-up of 
the "radiating eye" from the front cover of the official UK single 
release of _The_Man_With_the_Child_in_His_Eyes_ on the back.
     Kate's performances are extremely professional, with no hint of 
uncertainty about intonation or anything--although at the very end of 
_She's_Leaving_Home_ Kate finishes a beat later than the arrangement 
evidently indicated, a mistake no doubt prompted by what must have been 
minimal rehearsal time and poor orchestral direction. (Anyway, the 
error does not damage the performance, since the arrangement ends at 
that point.) Kate's voice is at its most spectacularly _high-pitched_ 
in all three performances, and she does manage to add two or three 
interesting little melodic flourishes to the Beatles songs, despite 
their abbreviated length.
     All in all, IED agrees completely with Peter FitzGerald-Morris, 
who called this bootleg "a treasure". 



LIVE CDS

        _Kate_Bush_Live_ (or _Live_At_Hammersmith_1979_). (1989) By its 
physical make-up IED strongly suspects that it is a product from the 
same group who have been putting out the now-famous Beatles 
_Back-Track_ and _Off-White_ CDs. The package of this KT CD is a normal 
jewel-box, with a hard-card cover (folded over once), and four colour 
photographs of Kate on the front. The track listings are almost 
completely accurate and are clearly set out. The photo/track- listing 
card is very sharply printed and glossy. Also on the cover is a red 
official KBC "KT" symbol--though of course this is _not_ an official 
producet. 
     The CD contains fifteen tracks. The first twelve are simply the 
same old _Live_at_Hammersmith_Odeon_ audio-track, though this time it 
has been very well lifted from the new Japanese edition of the 
laser-disk, which features a digital re-mastering of the original 
analog tapes. Track thirteen is the live performance of _Running_Up_ 
That_Hill_ from the _Amnesty_International_Secret_Policeman's_Third_ 
Ball_:_The_Music_ CD. Track fourteen is the live performance of 
_Breathing_ from the _Comic_Relief:_Utterly_Utterly_Live_ CD. And track 
fifteen is the track _This_Woman's_Work_ from the _She's_Having_ 
a_Baby_ soundtrack CD. The three extra tracks are re-mixed so that the 
applause from the end of the _Hammersmith_ tape fades into the applause 
from _Running_Up_That_Hill_, and ditto for _Breathing_. The only error 
in the track-listing is in the identification of the two live tracks as 
both coming from 1988. Actually both are from at least a year earlier. 
No big deal. The sound of all these tracks is exceptionally good even 
for a legitimate release, and unheard of in the history of Kate Bush 
bootlegs. Nevertheless, its price may be considered very high by many 
fans, especially those who already have these recordings in their 
original, legitimate configuration.
        Front cover:  four color pix, including a second take from the 
pose used for the US cover of "The Kick Inside" and three others most 
likely from those sessions.  Inside face:  the famous EMI publicity 
photo for that album.  Cropped, some (ref. Vermorel p. 62).

        Notes: Recorded live in concert 1979
        On the cover is the note - 'We apologize for the non excellent 
quality of the recording, which has been realized with sixties amateur 
equipment'.
        Comments:   Although the above note implies that this is a 
bootleg the CD is listed in German import catalogues under the number 
(036-092).  The quality is very good except that in a couple of places 
a 'surface noise' can be heard, as though this is a digital copy of a 
record. This noise is minimal and does not distract from the well 
edited performance.
