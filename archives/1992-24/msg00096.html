        Official video tapes are:
    Live At The Hammersmith Odeon (1983).  TV special of Kate's only 
concert tour, unfortunately it contains only one hour out of the two 
and a half hour show.  The missing footage has never been seen, aside 
from one showing at the 1985 Kate Bush Convention.
        The Whole Story (1986). Contains most of Kate's videos up to 
1986.
        The Single File (1983).  Contains all of Kate's video up till 
1983. Similar to The Whole Story, but contains five videos not on The 
Whole Story (the earlier "Wow" video, Hammer Horror, Them Heavy People, 
Suspended In Gaffa, There Goes A Tennor) and lacks the newer videos.  
Not available in the U.S.A., but it is available on import from Canada.
        The Sensual World (1989). Contains videos from that album and 
interview footage.  The American version contains much less interview 
footage then the British version.  The British version is the complete 
1989 VH-1 special.
        The Hair Of The Hound (1986) is now out of date, as The Whole 
Story contains everything on The Hair Of The Hound. 

                There are also more then a hundred "underground" 
videos, which are traded amoung fans and are shown at Katemas parties 
and the like.  These are primarily television performances and 
interviews. 

Printed books on Kate are numerous, more details about and corrections 
to
these books are available in the archives:

        Kate Bush - A Visual Documentary (1988).  Probably the best 
liked book overall.
        Kate Bush Complete - "Official" book containing the sheet music 
to all of Kate's songs up to 1986.  Also contains separate lyrics, a 
great chronology, many photos, and a discography.  
        Cathy (1986) - Book of photos of Kate as a child, by her 
brother, John Carter Bush.  No longer available. :-(
        The Illustrated Collector's Guide To Kate Bush (1991) - Book 
with details and pictures of all kinds of Kate Kollectables, fun even 
for non-collectors.  To order send $13.95 to C-SIDE RECORDS, PO BOX 
8456
CLEARWATER, FL  34618.  Phone 1-813-461-4327.  C-SIDE is also a good 
place to get all kinds of Kate stuff, be sure to get on their mailing 
list.
        Kate Bush - The Whole Story (1988).  Despite appearances, not a 
sanctioned book, and certainly not the whole story.   Positive, but 
contains numerous factual and publishing errors.  For "The Whole Story" 
on this book, see Andrew Marvick's review in the archives.
        Kate Bush - The First Twelve Years [1992].  Homeground says: is 
another collection of newpaper and magazine cutting covering the years 
from 1978 in two volumes selling for about L12-00 in Britain and L15 
postpaid to America.  Details can be obtained via the fanzine Never For 
Ever.   [Who's address they list as 28 Millbrook St, Plasmar 1, Swansea 
 SA6 8JY Wales]
        Kate Bush - With Love (1988).  Reprints of Kate-related 
articles, interviews, and reviews, some positive, some negative.  
Interesting mainly to see how the music press has reacted to Kate over 
the years.
        Secret History of Kate Bush (And The Strange Art Of Pop) 
(1983). Intellectual (as opposed to intelligent) book about Kate's 
family history,
story, and fans.  Commonly available, but only recommend for the 
photos.
        Kate Bush: Princess of Suburbia by Fred and Judy Vermorel 
(1980?), again only recommended for the photos.  Hard to find. 
        Kate Bush: An Illustrated Biography (1980) by Paul Kerton, 
positive but error-prone book.  Interesting yet again mainly for the 
photos.  Hard to find.  Was also available in German.

        After being on love-hounds for a few months, most fans find the 
fanzines rarely have information they have not already heard.  The most 
common fanzines are the Kate Bush Club (KBC) and Homeground.   The KBC 
unfortunately only seems to come now when there is a new album out, but 
is always worth the wait as it has original articles by Kate and her 
family and lots of great photos.  KBC,  PO Box 120,  Welling Kent,  
DA16 3DS,  UK 
        Homeground comes out almost regularly and has news, great 
articles, stories, and drawings.   Homeground, PO Box 176, Orpington, 
Kent, BR5 3NA 
UK 

        Kate's session work for other artists include:_You_ for Roy 
Harper, _Sing, _Children,_Sing_ for Leslie Duncan (Kate is scarcely 
identifiable), _Flowers_ for Zaine Griff, 
_The_Man_With_the_Child_in_His_Eyes_ for Ray Shell, _The_Seer_ for Big 
Country, _The_King_is_Dead_ for Go West, _Sister_and_Brother_ for Midge 
Ure, _Do_Bears_Sh..._in_the_Woods?_ with Rowan Atkinson (from 
_The_Utterly_Utterly_Live_Comic_Relief_ album) , and _No_Self_Control_, 
_Games_Without_Frontiers_ and _Don't_Give_Up_ for Peter Gabriel; plus 
her performance of the Maurice Jarre/Paul Webster song _The_Magician_, 
which is only barely audible in the background of the Alan Arkin movie, 
_The_Magician_of_Lublin_.   Also, the never released title track for 
the movie _Brazil_ and _The_Spirit_Of_The_Forest_ benefit single.  Also 
the title track for Roy Harper's _Once_.


FILES AVAILABLE 

All past messages of rec.music.gaffa/love-hounds-digest can be ftp'd 
from the love-hounds archive at ftp.UU.NET [137.39.1.9] in 
/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/archives.  Song lyrics, interviews, the Garden 
and Cloudbusting, etc are in /usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb on the same 
host. 


There are innumberable GIF (picture) files available including pics 
from the 1990 Kate Bush convention, which include pics of Kate's house 
and a Love-Hounds group pic (lovename.gif).  Also, there are pics from 
the Cathy book (cathy??.gif), pics from the This Woman's Work booklet 
(TWW??.gif), pics from the 1979 Tour of Life booklet (page_??.gif), and 
uncounted more.

To view these GIFs you will need a program for your type of computer.   
Public domain picture file viewers include CSHOW and PICEM for the IBM, 
TURBOGIF and HAMGIF for the Amiga, and Giffer or QuickGif for the 
Macintosh.
 
GIF files are also available in 
/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/pix/gif [and gif.new, gif_footah, 
gif.saintjohn, pix.hill, gif_tour_program, gif.newer, gif.fenger] 
 
If you've never used ftp, you use a program on your UNIX system called 
FTP. 
 You connect by typing: 
ftp ftp.UU.NET 
Log in as "anonymous", and use your username as your password. 
To change directories type: 
cd usenet/rec.music.gaffa 
"dir" will get you a directory, "get" and the filename will retrieve 
the file.  If you "cd" again into "archives" or "kb" you'll find the 
main goodies, with "pix" being another subdirectory within "kb", and 
"gif" and "gif.new" within "pix".  (When downloading gif's, set your 
transfer type to binary by typing 
binary 
at the "ftp&gt;" prompt.) 

Two priceless resources for Katefans have recently been made available, 
both of Thewhich are much more interesting then anything published: 
        "The Garden" is Andrew Marvick's compilation of reference 
material on Kate, [availible in /usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/garden] 
including a detailed chronology of her life and career (much more 
complete then anything available anywhere else) [GARDEN01].  Also, a 
listing of all known Kate recordings, videography (which includes both 
official videos and the television appearances), and an extensive list 
of fan magazines  [GARDEN02].  ALL of the lyrics (including background 
voices) to ALL of Kate's known songs (including unreleased songs) 
[GARDEN04].  All of John's and Paddy's [GARDEN03] interviews and 
articles for the Kate Bush Club Newsletter, as well as Kate's articles 
for the KBC [GARDEN05, GARDEN06].  Also included are about sixty 
interviews [GARDEN07 through GARDEN10].
        "Cloudbusting - Kate Bush In Her Own Words" is Ron Hill's 
compilation of almost 200 interviews, sorted by song, story, and 
subject order, forming the closest we may ever see to a full-fledged 
Kate autobiography.  It is available in regular text format, or in 
Wordperfect 4.2 format, which makes use of Wordperfect's underlining, 
bolding, and italizing, ability, and contains an extensive index.  It 
is also available in MacWrite II, PostScript, and Word 4.0 versions.  
(Eventually the unedited interviews will be added into The Garden). 
        There are also a series of Cloudbusting GIF (picture) files, 
which are located in love-hounds/kb/cloudbusting/gif.  A title page 
[CTITLE.GIF and a larger version, CTITLEB.GIF], a title page for Part 
II [CSTORY.GIF] and part III [CSUBJECT.GIF], a credits screen 
[CREDITS.GIF], and a pic of 3 inch disk label [CLABEL.GIF, and a b&amp;w 
version CLABELBW.GIF].  There are also pictures for most of the albums 
which show the picture of Kate from the album cover next to a listing 
of songs [titles begin with "O"].  There are also "alternative" pics 
for some of the albums, which show pictures SIMULAR to but not 
identical to the album covers [files begin with "A"].  There are also 
"full" pictures for some of the albums [titles begin with "F"], which 
are the raw, uncropped, pictures.
        Cloudbusting is available in /usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/cloudbus
ting.  The text version is in /love-hounds/kb/cloudbusting/text.   
Filenames are cloud0.txt, cloud1a.txt, cloud1b.txt, cloud1c.txt, 
cloud2a.txt, cloud2b.txt, cloud3a.txt, cloud 3b.txt, cloud3c.txt, 
cloud4.txt, cloud5.txt, clouds.txt.  It is also available compressed 
with ZIP in /love-hounds/kb/cloudbusting/zip as filenames cloud045.zip, 
cloud1.zip, cloud2.zip, cloud3.zip. 
        For those that can't get Cloudbusting any other way, there are 
two Cloudbusting "mail chains", one Wordperfect and the other Text.  To 
get on these, simply leave a message saying you want to, and include 
which version you want.   You will then be mailed the disks, and be 
obligated to mail them to the next person who asks.  The disk package 
is on five IBM 3 inch 720k disks, and includes Cloudbusting, the 
Cloudbusting GIFS, and the non-interview Garden files.  (You may want 
to try the proccess mentioned below first). 

        A third, in-progress, book will be "Deeper Understanding - A 
collection of Kate Bush articles" which will compile the "best of" the 
Love-Hounds as well as a few articles from fan magazines and lots of 
published reviews.   It'll be about five megs in size.
