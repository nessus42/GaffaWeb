Hi Fellow Hounds:

Last night's (16 June 1995) _Dateline NBC_ had a profile of expatriate
harmonica virtuoso (and Kate Bush collaborator) Larry Adler.  This was either
a repeat or has been in the can a few months.  Cher, Jon Bon Jovi, Meatloaf,
Elton John and _Glory of Gershwin_ producer George Martin were either seen
singing vocal tracks or otherwise briefly on camera.  No Kate
sighting--sorry!

It turns out that Adler has had quite a life.  As an in-demand backing player
he worked with the best in the biz, including George Gershwin himself in the
30s.  After the Second World War he was listed in "Red Channels," the bogus
but powerful tally of alleged Communists in the entertainment industry.
 Adler soon found himself without gigs and in exile in England.  He was
eventually embraced by the British film industry and scored a number of
movies, most notably the British classic _Genevieve_ (well worth seeing,
BTW.)

He's quite a character!  Yes, he *did* tell the old tale about his chance
encounter with Al Capone that became a staple of his concert tour.  And in an
eerie echo of the past Adler is seen performing on stage with the ghost of
his old friend--a piano programmed to tickle the ivories in perfect
synchonization with George Gershwin's own playing.  In all, the segment was
well worth seeing if not exactly a keeper (now, if Kate had been in it... ;-)

Take care,

Chris
