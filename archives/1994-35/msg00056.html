&gt;
&gt; &gt;What the heck ever happend with the CD ROM anyway?  Did anybody ever get
&gt; &gt;one running?  Did it ever make it to the US?  Did Graham ever get MPEG
&gt; &gt;capabilities? What was on it?  How was it? Interview material?  Lyrics?
&gt;
&gt;    Uli downloaded everything and determined that it would be possible
&gt; to convert everything into a universally usable hypertext format. But
&gt; it sort of wound up being put on the back-burner until one of us gets
&gt; a CD-ROM recorder so that a test disk could be made. It would be
&gt; a real drag to go through the trouble and expense of creating a
&gt; glass master and pressing a test disk and discovering that the
&gt; audio clips and movies played jerkey, or not at all. Uli indicated
&gt; that when the price drops enough he will get one, and then the project
&gt; can go ahead.
&gt;
&gt;    The basic idea was to make one in the 9660 format, so that it would
&gt; be compatible with DOS, Windows, Mac, Amiga, Unix and NeXT. We would
&gt; have to find viewers for all these in order to make the hypertext stuff
&gt; work. One idea: a WWW compatible system. Mosiac allows browsing locally,
&gt; and versions exist for all these formats. So, produce the entire thing
&gt; in HTML, include archives of WWW browsers for each of the formats on the
&gt; disk with standard picture viewers and sound players. Hey, maybe Coke
&gt; would be interested in tossing a little funding our way to include the
&gt; Fruitopia ads!
&gt;
&gt;     If someone out there is a WWW guru, let me know is this workable.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;For that matter, will the updated Laserdisc of The Whole Story with the
&gt; &gt;TSW videos included ever come out here?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Will Sony follow up TRS with an "Aspects of The Red Shoes"?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Will Sony ever participate in r.m.g. to answer questions?  Offer promos?
&gt; &gt;Ask our opinions on a particular topic?
&gt;
&gt;    Probably all for the best that they haven't. See the Sarah McLachlin
&gt; list to see the ugly spectacle of a record company "getting involved."
&gt; Nettwerk has decided that they can control things on the net and have
&gt; posted "guidelines" for how the list t-shirt (that they are not paying
&gt; for) will look. This is an ugly direction. Kate would *not* have
&gt; approved of the very fine design of the Love-Hounds shirt. She and Sarah
&gt; both dislike seeing their faces on other people's chests. So they "ruled
&gt; out" any pictures. Screw that.
&gt;
&gt;     The reason to wear fannish t-shirts is to meet fellow fans. If it
&gt; doesn't feature a picture and the artist's name, it doesn't serve
&gt; it's purpose. I have a pair of Sarah t-shirts from her tour. They
&gt; feature Sarah's artwork, but no picture, and her name is only in
&gt; her rather spidery handwriting. No one has ever commented on the
&gt; shirts. It's a shame, because if they featured Sarah's image, I would
&gt; have no doubt met many closet Sarah fans.
&gt;
&gt;     If Kate had been asked for her opinion on the design of a t-shirt
&gt; we would have wound up with no picture. Hell, the official Konvention
&gt; t-shirts don't even have her damn *name* on them. By the time
&gt; of the next Konvention, the t-shirts will probably have no writing or
&gt; pictures, featuring only a particular color.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;And where did Tori Amos get that "Eat the Music" fruit hairdo made?
&gt; &gt;Kinda cute.
&gt;
&gt;    Um, what *are* you talking about. Fruit hairdo?
&gt;

Re your comments on Nettwerk. Um...I'm worried. Being the guy who set
Nettwerk up on the Internet and working this very second on Sarah's CDROM
project. I have always (3 years or so) read your posts and valued your
opinions. So...tell me where we are going wrong?
