Just some random thoughts:

tshenkel@billings.lib.mt.us  asked:
:But am I the only one who gets a catch in their throat listening to :Never
Be Mine?

No you are not, this album came out at just the right time, I was having a
hard time getting over a past relationship and after seeing my ex and hearing
this song one line stuck out for me 'I want you as the dream, not the
reality'.  After not seeing him for a long time then seeing him again I
realized I'd made him into something greater then he was.  I understand this
song better then most.


As far as another Lovehounds collection:

I truly appreciate all the hard work that was put into this and I know it
will take me a long while to get bored with the tapes.  I see no reason  to
put out a new one in the near future.  Let's be realistic, Kate only has done
a small number of interviews and live performances (compared to other
artists) and the number isn't getting bigger daily.  I've been lucky, I
guess, to be a couch potato most evenings and have seen most of the Fruitopia
ads.  I think that if they were put onto the next Collection, I would find
them pleasant in a couple of years, sort of like an old photograph you
haven't seen for years but when you find it and it brings back all types of
memories.  They are still fresh in our minds, let them sit on a shelf for
awhile then bring them back out for us to rediscover them.  Not to mention
TLTCTC will be/has been released and it will take us all a long while to soak
all that in, especially those of us who missed it in the theaters.

Chris, I would like to thank you for the wonderful job you did on the
Lovehounds Collection, even my husband (a non-KateFan(tm)) enjoyed parts of
it.  Don't let anyone rush another one, it took about 16 years, 7 albums, and
one 'Best of' album to get enough stuff for this Collection.  You should let
us wait for at least one, maybe two, more albums to be released before even
thinking of compling more video for the next one.

Just babbling away a rainy day,
Jennifer 

Not that it really matters, but IMHO 'Experiment IV' is the best video of all
time.
