The worthy Chris Williams writes:

 &gt; The basic idea was to make one in the 9660 format,
 &gt; so that it would be compatible with DOS, Windows, Mac,
 &gt; Amiga, Unix and NeXT. We would have to find viewers for
 &gt; all these in order to make the hypertext stuff work. One 
 &gt; idea: a WWW compatible system. Mosiac allows browsing
 &gt; locally, and versions exist for all these formats. So,
 &gt; produce the entire thing in HTML, include archives of 
 &gt; WWW browsers for each of the formats on the disk with
 &gt; standard picture viewers and sound players. Hey, maybe 
 &gt; Coke would be interested in tossing a little funding our 
 &gt; way to include the Fruitopia ads!

IED is new to and still largely ignorant of these 
technological issues, so has a foolish question.  Does the above information
mean that Uli or Chris knows that the Whole Story CD-ROM contains more than
just transfers of the majority of Kate Bush's official videos into the
digital domain ?  IED was under the impression that this CD-ROM was really
more of a video compilation in CD-ROM form than a full-fledged CD-ROM. 

By the way, IED naturally assumes that Chris and Uli are merely suggesting
the use of Mosaic as an access medium for hypertext content (if there is any)
on the CD-ROM, and not proposing to upload the official videos contained on
the CD-ROM so that they might be accessed by WWW users.  Is 
this correct?  Since the latter would not differ in any but a technological
way from poor Marcel Rijs's proposal that a dub of TCTCTL might be included
in a hypothetical L-Hs Coll. Vol. 2, IED is confident that only the former
was suggested.

Finally, since no-one else has seen fit to say it, IED is compelled to
observe that, Chris's dudgeon notwithstanding, the fine gradations of ethical
code put forth here the other day by its Master Editor to justify the
Love-Hounds Collection's many copyright infringements and, by comparison, to
condemn Marcel's mere words, failed to convince this skeptic.  IED greatly
appreciates the many fine contributions which Marcel has made to Love-Hounds
to date, and sincerely hopes he will not be bowed by the heat his recent
ideas about the Collection have engendered. 

Armored in advance to receive without further objeKTion the inevitable
flames, Andrew Marvick remains your servant, 

IED
