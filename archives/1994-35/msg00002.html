Fiona replies:
&gt;Re my remarks on the Love and Anger video:
&gt;
&gt;I did not say the video did not have a storyline. I said that I did not
&gt;think the images in the video were put together with the intent of sending
&gt;a message to record company executives.

   I didn't say that it was intended to send a message to the record
company executives either. I feel that it is about the situation of
being told to make a video for a song that was not her choice for a
single. I wouldn't think that she would expect them to "get it." 
Haven't you ever made a joke about someone you disliked (say, the
school bully) with the specific intention that the object of the joke
*not* get it? 

&gt;I seem to recall Kate saying in an interview that she herself was not sure
&gt;what the song was about. Thus, I would be quite willing to accept that
&gt;the video might not have a storyline, if the creator is not sure that the
&gt;song does. However, if I were to try to explain the video, I would say that
&gt;the first part with the dancers, the orb and sceptre, glitter, etc. are
&gt;somehow related to working through or dealing with the problem the song
&gt;seems to be talking about. The band scene may represent the state where
&gt;the problem has been resolved and a celebration of the new, improved
&gt;person results. But, of course, that is my own interpretation.

    Then what is the crux of the video? In the original version (not
seen on later edits) the line of ballet dancers grab the orb and septre
from Kate and she spazzes out. What was that changing? What are you
saying the message of the video is? "Don't worry, be happy?" Please,
Kate's world view, as far as we can tell from her songs, is *much*
more complex than that.

&gt; As to the
&gt;significance of the orb and sceptre, I would say they might represent the
&gt;individual's inner strength and self-esteem (a theme that has certainly
&gt;occurred in Ms. B.'s other work, and a theme which would certainly relate
&gt;to what seems to be going on in the song). However, my more overwhelming
&gt;inclination is to say that they look very striking against a dark background.

   As do her skin, hair and dress. But they are symbols of a national
level, roughly equivilent to an American artist wrapping herself in a
flag holding a bald eagle. Far too loaded, and specifically
representative of the monarchy to simply be intended to be symbols of
personal empowerment. Agreed, they could well be intended to carry that
message, but I still have some trouble seeing your view covering the
entire video in a consistant way.

&gt;Finally: another video where there is such a dramatic switch between the
&gt;first and second parts? easy. The Big Sky.

    But the first part deals with looking at the sky, star-gazing,
falconing, sailing and the second part could be considered a celebration
of those who voyage in the sky, astronauts, pilots, balloonists and
the simple joy of flight.
