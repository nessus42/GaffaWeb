&gt;   Probably all for the best that they haven't. See the Sarah McLachlin
&gt;list to see the ugly spectacle of a record company "getting involved."
&gt;Nettwerk has decided that they can control things on the net and have
&gt;posted "guidelines" for how the list t-shirt (that they are not paying
&gt;for) will look. This is an ugly direction. Kate would *not* have
&gt;approved of the very fine design of the Love-Hounds shirt. She and Sarah
&gt;both dislike seeing their faces on other people's chests. So they "ruled
&gt;out" any pictures. Screw that.

chris, it'd be best if you didn't spout nonsense like this when you are
misinformed as to what is going on. nettwerk did *not* post guidelines 
about how the t-shirt would look and have made *no* attempt to control 
what the shirt will look like. 

nettwerk relayed sarah's request that she know what the proposed shirt
designs were. meredith agreed to the request feeling that sarah, as the
owner of her work, had a right to at least know what the designs were
beforehand. sarah asked that one shirt design be removed from the ballot
that meredith was going to post to fte. meredith agreed and posted the
modified ballot.

i find it hypocritical that you, after your attack on marcel for his
"stupid" suggestion of including tltctc on the next collection video,
would not support sarah's right to control her work - even on a fan
t-shirt that nettwerk would not have bothered to prosecute even if
sarah had not approved of the final design (which, as any fte
subscriber would know, is far from finalized).
