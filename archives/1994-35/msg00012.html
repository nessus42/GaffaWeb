(I suspect Jennifer has never seen a full Kate videography)

&gt; As far as another Lovehounds collection:
&gt; 
&gt; I truly appreciate all the hard work that was put into this and I know it
&gt; will take me a long while to get bored with the tapes.  I see no reason  to
&gt; put out a new one in the near future.  Let's be realistic, Kate only has done
&gt; a small number of interviews and live performances (compared to other
&gt; artists)

Oh...even though my post sounded like a "get off his case" wrt to Chris doing
another LHC, I didn't mean it that way at all.  Chris will definitely 
appreciate your thanks when he reads it later.

No flames here, but I have to say that you're very wrong. There are literally
hours and hours and hours of things left.  We probably have at *least* 15
hours of stuff, and we don't even have anywhere near everything.  There
could be 2 LH Collections a year until the year 2000 and still not take
care of everything.  Granted, a big chunk of the stuff comes from Kate's
first 2 years of "being famous" and there are lots of duplicates (like
all the many, many versions of "Wuthering Heights" and the myriad Italian
versions of "The Dreaming" etc.) and there's lots that can only be
appreciated by die-hard, hard-core fans, but there's a massive amount 
of really great stuff, from interviews (small amount? She's done tons!)
to documentaries (there's still the amazing German -?I forget- documentary
that combines a lot of footage from the tour* with a great interview, and
the documentary about putting the tour together, which also includes many
great interview bits) to features/lip syncs/news items/chart shows and
all kinds of other odds and ends.
  
*footage not taken from Hammersmith which was filmed at the end of the
tour, but rather from the *beginning* of the tour.  It's on film instead
of video, there are songs not on the Hammersmith, and you won't believe
how *normal* Kate's hair looks.  Yes folks, her hair suffered massive
amounts of damage during the tour.  It's not *supposed* to look that way
(the way it does in the Hammersmith).

&gt; Chris, I would like to thank you for the wonderful job you did on the
&gt; Lovehounds Collection, even my husband (a non-KateFan(tm)) enjoyed parts of
&gt; it.  Don't let anyone rush another one, it took about 16 years, 7 albums, and
&gt; one 'Best of' album to get enough stuff for this Collection.

Actually, we were thinking about doing this (a Katefan Video Collection)
in 1984 for the readers of BreakThrough, and even then we had enough for
at least 5 or 6 tapes.  So, better late than never :-), and these are
*much* better quality that what we could have offered back then.

&gt;  You should let us wait for at least one, maybe two, more albums to
&gt; be released before even thinking of compling more video for the next one.

* Vickie pictures Love-Hounds running around, screaming, tearing out
their hair at the thought of such a wait for the next LHC.

No no, it won't be *that* long, I promise :)

&gt; Just babbling away a rainy day,
&gt; Jennifer 

No problem :-)
