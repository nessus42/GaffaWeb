&gt;&gt; Did you compose your response to Chris very soon after reading
&gt;&gt; his message? If so I would advise counting to 100 in future. &lt;G&gt;
                                                                ^^^
This wasn't to be taken too seriously.

&gt;Here's some interesting, important information for some of you.
&gt;I _always_ think about what I write. Upon reading Chris's message
&gt;I was infuriated. Believe me, the original message was much
&gt;harsher, and _very_ insulting. But I realize you can't write
&gt;something like that in public, I have always realized that, except
&gt;maybe in the beginning of my e-mail "carreer". But that's how I
&gt;learned.
&gt;So yes, I counted to 10.000 before throwing my message in
&gt;cyberspace.

What I said was phrased wrong. However, even after counting to 10 000 you
still found it necessary to use vulgarities yourself?

&gt;But I really want to get across one thing to all: THINK when you
&gt;write. E-mail is fast and friendly, but sometimes words can come
&gt;across very unfortunate.
&gt;....
&gt;There _are_ persons behind these little ascii texts, and some of
&gt;them can get hurt quite easily. And I do have an elephants' skin,
&gt;but sometimes I throw it off, because there's a point to be made.

Agreed

&gt;As for my suggestion: I see it may have been stupid to toss it up,
&gt;but during the last 15 months I have seen distributions of the
&gt;strangest things via the Internet, however illegal or morally
&gt;objectionable. So I figured _what the heck, let's say it_. No-one
&gt;could take offence at an _idea_... Like it's been said, just say no
&gt;to it. I can understand a simple no, even if it's in English.
&gt;:-)

I can see now why you thought that, however you are wrong to think no-one
can take offense at an _idea_, look back in history, wars have been fought
over _ideas_.

Adrian
