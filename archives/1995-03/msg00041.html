Hi Marion, hi all!

Not sooo long ago (Jan. 15) Marion wrote:

&gt; &gt; IED has a question for you:  you say you saw Kate perform
&gt; &gt; "Wuthering Heights" on TopPop "a couple of times".  Can you
&gt; &gt; remember whether these were two different performances, or the
&gt; &gt; same one broadcast twice?  Also, do you remember whether Kate
&gt; &gt; was wearing a plain long dark dress or a kind of floral print?
&gt;
&gt; Well, I've been digging in my memory, in my 'archives', and in
&gt; Marcel's video collection (Hi Marcel! :) ), and here's what I
&gt; could find: some pretty useless facts about "Wuthering Heights"
&gt; in the Netherlands, 1978. :-)
[...]
good research!

&gt; And now the important bit. :)  The 'Nationale Hitparade' was the
&gt; one that TopPop used, and according to my listings they showed
&gt; "Wuthering Heights" twice. I seem to recall having seen it more
&gt; often than that - must have been the Efteling special and stuff
&gt; like that.
[...]
&gt; I think there were two different recordings. I have this image
&gt; in my head of Kate dancing on grass, and at one point bending
&gt; backwards until she's standing on hands and feet. Less than a
&gt; second I think, but that image stuck with me for ever since. From
&gt; what I've read in the FAQ and seen from other video's and
&gt; everything this could have been the Rockflix video - could it?
&gt; Does anybody know? I would really love to see this one again...

Well, I don't KNOW this, but it sounds like this is it. In the Rockflix
video Kate did wear a red dress and danced on grass.

&gt; The other appearance was with Kate in the TopPop studio. Here she
&gt; wore a long black dress, with black or grey lace or something.
&gt; There were two images, Kate's face close up, singing, in front,
&gt; the left half of the screen, and Kate dancing, small in the back
&gt; in the upper right corner of the screen. The dancing is quite
&gt; similar to some other versions I've seen, the setting is similar
&gt; to for example the video in the white dress (with the two Kates).

This sounds like the following entry from IED's The Garden:

        11. Wuthering Heights: lip-synch, on an April, 1978 edition of
    German TV programme Top Pop. Note: Ruud says this is a Dutch programme.
    Peter says it is German. In it, Kate simply lip-synchs the song, adding
    her dance routine. Throughout most of the performance Kate's face is
    super-imposed so that it hovers to the left of a shot of her entire
    figure. She wears another of her print, midi-length dresses and
    "seventies" high heels, and her make-up is unmistakably "of its time".

Which would also answer the question in there, namely that TopPop is a
Dutch programme (adding the fact that I never heard of a German programme
called Top Pop [which doesn't mean too much, I was 10 years old then...]).

IED? Marion?

&gt; I think this was the second time, as I remember I was a bit
&gt; disappointed - I really liked the dancing on the grass, and would
&gt; have loved to see that one again.

The Rockflix video is available on a commercial sampler tape, though the
sound quality is quite bad and the video quality isn't very good either.
See FAQ (coming soon) for some details.

Bye,

Uli
