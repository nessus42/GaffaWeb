&gt;&gt;--&gt; a Molly Bloom who is aware of her own textuality in "The Sensual World,"
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;				  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;this has an intriguing flavor to it, please describe this further.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;	Basically, the song's lyrics are taken (more or less) from the 
&gt;last two or three pages of Molly Bloom's "soliloquy" at the end of 
&gt;_Ulysses_, where she's recalling the time when she agreed to marry Leopold.
&gt;What Kate Bush does is to assume the personality of a Molly who is aware of 
&gt;being a textual character and who wishes to "roll off of Howth Head 
&gt;and into the flesh."  She feels confines by the limits of the textual world
&gt;and wishes to step "out of the page and into the sensual world." She
&gt;also indicates that she would like to "rewrite the speech" that Joyce
&gt;has given her, although she doesn't say exactly how.  :-)

    Sharp eyes. Kate originally wrote the song with the words from the book,
but the Joyce estate, for some perverse reason decided not to give Kate
permission to use the original words. She was forced to "re-write the speech"
(she whispers these words in the song.) In doing so, she changed it from
the setting of the original book, to Molly coming out of the book, experiencing
the same physical, sensual world that we and Kate inhabit.

&gt;	Well, that's it in a nutshell.  I'm afraid I'm a little too lazy
&gt;to type in all the lyrics, but I'm sure that there's a WWW or FTP-site 
&gt;somewhere that has a copy of them.  I've cross-posted this article to
&gt;rec.music.gaffa (the Kate Bush newsgroup), so maybe someone there can
&gt;direct you to a place you can see the lyrics yourself.  (The song "The
&gt;Sensual World," btw, is on the album of the same name.  It's not one 
&gt;of Kate's most prog-ish albums, but it's certainly not bad.  If you're
&gt;a prog fan and you're not familiar with her stuff, I'd probably 
&gt;reccomend _The Dreaming_ as a first buy; it's Kate at her most 
&gt;experimental.)

   The lyrics to all of Kate's albums, and most of her songs are at:

ftp.uwp.edu 

/pub/music/lyrics/b/bush.kate

      Jorn Barger was the first Love-Hound to discover the source
and he produced a version of the "original" lyrics. Jon Drukman
recorded Jen Tunney (sp?) singing these words over
the insturmental recording of "The Sensual World."
