Archive-name: music/kate-bush-faq-diffs
Last-modified: 1995/01/24
Version: 1.2.f minus 1.2.a

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action.  The full version is posted to
rec.music.gaffa only.  You can get a full copy of the FAQ by requesting it from
me (uli@zoodle.robin.de).  If you subscribe to the list (done by sending
email to love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net) Bill Wisner will also provide you
with the full FAQ.  If you can't receive more than 64KB in one piece I can
split the FAQ for you.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.  Cosmetical changes aren't listed.

-------------------8&lt;-------------------
1.2. What is Love-Hounds?

     To subscribe to Love-Hounds you should send a friendly mail to Bill
     Wisner, the "moderator" of the list.  Send it to

        love-hounds-request@uunet.UU.NET

     and specify whether you want bounce mail (every single message is
     forwarded to you) or 24h digests (all messages of a day are packed
     into one mail).  Remember that human beings aren't working 24 hours
     on each of those 365 days a year.

[the last sentence is new]

2.1. Who is Happy Rhodes?

     [...]  If you want to
     subscribe to this list, whose broad range of discussion now includes
     many other female artists (including Kate Bush), send a request to
     rutgers via:

        ecto-request@nsmx.rutgers.edu

     or

        ecto-request-digest@nsmx.rutgers.edu

     with a line in the message body

        subscribe ecto

     or

        subscribe ecto you@a.different.address

[Ecto's address changed slightly, though the previous one (...@ns1...) will
work for at least a while, the majordomo 'user' also works, but doesn't
default to regular or digest.]

4.4. Basic Discography/Videography

     Live At The Hammersmith Odeon (1981):
        TV special of Kate's only concert tour, unfortunately it contains only
        one hour out of the two and a half hour show.  Now also available as
        CD+video double pack (PAL and NTSC, the latter from Canada).

[NTSC version is now also available!]

     Kate has worked with a lot of other artists:

     - Roy Harper:
       - You (The Game Part II).  From "The Unknown Soldier", also available
         on "An Introduction To Roy Harper", which is available as a CD. [AK]
       - Once.  From "Once"

[Info about the sampler "An Introduction To Roy Harper" was added due to
the important fact (thanks Aaro!) that it is a CD and not an LP]

4.9. Kate Bush World Wide Web (WWW) pages

     Experiment IV, the Kate Bush Home Page:
        Thanks for Richard Frost &lt;rfrost@jrc.flinders.edu.au&gt; for setting
        this up, this is the definitive Kate Bush Web Page.  It's still
        under construction, but it is a one-stop center for all your
        Kate information needs.

        *** This page is down at the moment ***

[URL removed, since it doesn't work right now and probably won't work
ever again, the page is currently homeless]

     Sony Music's Kate Bush Web Page
        <A  HREF="http://www.music.sony.com/Music/ArtistInfo/KateBush.html">http://www.music.sony.com/Music/ArtistInfo/KateBush.html</A>

        This page mostly covers information in this FAQ and offers some nice
        photos seen never before.  Sony Music is the label Kate has been signed
        with in America since The Sensual World.

[negative comment removed, since the page improved a lot]

5.8. The Red Shoes

     Moments of Pleasure
        This song is Kate's tribute of several of her friends who've
        passed away.  Murph is Alan Murphy, her guitarist who died in
        1993(?) of AIDS.  Bill is Bill Duffy, the lighting technician
        for The Tour of Life, who died in an accident while setting up
        for the tour.  "Teddy" is the late John Barratt, assistant engineer at
        Abbey Road Studios during the recording sessions for "Never for Ever".
        No one (except Kate, as far as I know - [SB]) knows who anyone else is
        in this song, especially "George the Wipe".  The verse about the
        "balcony in New York" refers to her meeting of Michael Powell, director
        of the film "The Red Shoes".

[Added information about some other people who have been identified]

7.   Credits

     Some contributors that I somehow do remember (feel free to suggest more,
     I'll verify it...):

     AK:    Aaro Koskinen &lt;Aaro.Koskinen@Helsinki.FI&gt;

[A new one]

Bye,

Uli
