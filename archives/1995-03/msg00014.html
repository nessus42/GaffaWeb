Same goes for me.:) I'm, the only actual Kate-fan I've seen (in person I 
mean).

: But, I think we are losing sight of the point of the group.  We are here to talk
: about Kate.

Isn't ethics and philosophy connected with Kate?

:  I understand, believe me, how frustrating it can be to feel like a

: previously engaged conversation, but sometimes we just have to be patient.  If
: there is someone around who knows more than you, just accept it and learn from
: them.  I have.

Now, here's the problem...I for instance have never been really 
interested in anything else about Kate than her music...I do not enjoy 
petty details about her life...I uderstand many do and it is their right, 
to me it's just boring.

:  And then we can all get back to arguing over which album is best
: and remembering the first time we heard a Kate Bush song.  

Arguing matters of personal taste leads nowhere, neither do nostalgic 
memories about year 2525. But of cource these are ONLY my opinions (a 
matter of personal taste in it's own matter...hmm, seems I stumbled to my 
own cleverness, oh well, just forget what I said.:)  )

ps. I'd like to know which line of lyrics has the most profound efect on 
you all? To me it's the a from the FOG: 'Is this love big enough to watch 
over me  Big enough to let go of me?  Without hurting me'
