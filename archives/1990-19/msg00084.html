Vickie here. Welladay! My first show from Chicago has been taped, put
"in the can", sent down to Kansas City and has aired with no problems.
I guess you could say that I'm officially "syndicated" now :-) and all's
well. Sue (who took over my show while we were moving and will be normally
be doing the second hour live) wanted to go see The Tom Tom Club &amp; Debbie
Harry so I taped a two-hour show. It was an all-4AD show in honor of the
new Dead Can Dance album. There were things I didn't play because I only
have them on album (Colourbox w/ Lorita Grahme and TMC's Filligree And
Shadow, for instance) and we haven't unpacked our albums yet (we don't have
anywhere to put them). I had to stick to CDs for this show.
My "studio" that Chris built in a closet is wonderful and I taped the show
directly onto reel-to-reel. We'll be getting a mixer board in the future
when our finances are in better shape, but for now I have to play a song all
the way to the end, instead of fading from one to another. I am able to talk
with the music still going in the background which is nice because I can
play my opening theme music, then fade it down and have it still on while 
I'm welcoming people to the show. While the show aired, three listeners
called me in Chicago to tell me that they were listening and that the sound
quality was excellent. Gee, I'm 600 miles away and still getting calls--it's
just great!!

This is so very weird:
Living in Chicago
Having a radio show in Kansas City
Accessing Usenet via Boston

God, I love technology!
