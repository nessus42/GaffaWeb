&gt;
&gt;One of the really nice things for me about _The Sensual World_ is
&gt;that so much of it is about Kate Bush the songwriter and less
&gt;about Kate Bush the producer.  Her unmistakable touches are 
&gt;  [stuff about singability on _TSW_ and not on _TD_ deleted.]

Interesting.  One of my biggest memories when my sister, who had been
the first in my family to get turned on to Kate (from hearing Wuthering
Heights -- the Pat Benetar version! :) ), showed up with a cassette of
_The Dreaming_ one afternoon.  Her opinion was "hated it!  Where's her
singing gone?  Too many effects on her voice."  (She owned the first
3 albums, btw, and loved them.)  I on the other hand, started listening
to TD every day on my walkman just because there was so much to LISTEN
to.  I didn't even understand what half the lyrics were saying until
I got my quite worn out dup cassette replaced with a CD a couple years
back.  I think you are right... TSW is sort of a return to straight
songwriting for the most part.  I think I'll send my sister a copy.
