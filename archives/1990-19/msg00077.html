 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: _TSW_ vs. other KT LPs

   Apropos the suggestion that _TSW_ represents a purer form of
songwriting than does _TD_ or _HoL_: IED recalls an announcement
in _Homeground_, shortly before _TSW_ was released, in which Peter
reported that he had been told (supposedly by Kate or Del) that most
of the new album's songs had been composed at the piano--a method which
marks an important break from the way in which _HoL_ and _TD_ were composed.
(Both of those albums' songs had been composed mainly at the Fairlight; a
few with only electronic rhythms as accompaniment; and one &lt;_Waking_the_
Witch_&gt; with only an electric guitar, played by Alan Murphy according
to Kate's directions.)
   This difference goes a considerable way toward explaining the intriguing
(and so far apparently accurate) theory of Ed's that those Kate Bush
fans who find _TSW_ a satisfying album tend to belong to the group who
were first drawn to her work through one of the first three albums--most
songs on which were composed at the piano, just as those on _TSW_ are
reported to have been.
   Perversely perhaps, IED's current favorite among Kate's "albums"
is--the twenty-three _Cathy_ demos. So you can see that to this fan,
at least, the godhead which speaks through Kate Bush cannot be muted
by something as trivial as tape hiss; nor must her artistic genius
be applied equally to production and to songwriting in order for the
final work of art to radiate with divine perfeKTion.
