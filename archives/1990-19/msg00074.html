I think that the issue particularly centers around the
people who started to groove on Kate Bush because of
hearing _The Dreaming_ first.  In retrospect, while in
many ways it is the ultimate (and somewhat logical) extension
of her ideas at the time, it is still an anomoly for
someone who has a softer, feminine style (_Hounds of
Love_ is definitely much more "female" (to user Her
own words) than _The Dreaming_).  How to explain what I
mean without sounding sexist, I don't know, so I won't try.
It's just a feeling I get.  I don't think it's any better
or worse, just different.

Everyone I know who loved _The Dreaming_ has been disappointed
with _Hounds of Love_ at first (though they have, for
the most part, eventually come around).  The same forces
are at work with _The Sensual World_, an even more 
"Bushy" album (in many senses).  If you look at her
musical development from "The Man With The Child In His
Eyes" and "Passing Through Air" on down to "This Woman's
Work" _The Dreaming_ becomes more of a surreal side-stop
along the way than anything else (merits of the album aside -
I am referring to its place in the rest of her work).

Most of the people I know who think _The Dreaming_ is her
best album also like music with a harder edge to it than
I do - I think a lot of it is just personal preference.

I think that most of these people, had it not been for
_The Dreaming_, would have even gotten very into Kate
Bush in the first place (now, Jon, admit it, you know it
to be true - you're not a devoted KaTe Bush fan - 
you're just a closet BushWhacker, maybe even a Bush
League one at that ;-) ).
