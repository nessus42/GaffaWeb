&gt; &gt;That's rather a sweeping statement, Larry.  Can I make one as well?
&gt; &gt;Suppose we divide fans into those who discovered Kate at 'The Dreaming/
&gt; &gt;Hounds of Love' stage, and those who discovered her at the beginning.
&gt; &gt;Would it be correct to say that the former are the ones who are 'a
&gt; &gt;little disappointed with _TSW_'?  No evidence, no flames, just a
&gt; &gt;thought... :-)
&gt;
&gt; I think you're on to something here!  In fact, I've noticed it myself.
&gt; While I didn't discover her quite at the beginning, the first album of
&gt; hers that I heard (and that I fell in love with) was _The Kick Inside_.
&gt; Well, I love _The Sensual World_.  I haven't yet found any exceptions to
&gt; your rule, which I would state as follows:  If the first album you fell
&gt; in love with was _TKI_ or _Lionheart_, you'll think _TSW_ is a great
&gt; album. If the first such album was _TD_, or _HOL_, you won't.  I don't
&gt; know anybody whose first love is _Never For Ever_.

I think you're leaving out a large middle ground here, Ed, between what
James Smith said and what you said. For instance, I am *both* (a) convinced
that TSW is a great album, and (b) "a little disappointed with TSW."
Without going into specifics (right now), my perception of TSW is bothered
by this tiny chorus at the back of my ears saying "it could have been
better." I never had that feeling with "The Dreaming," and only briefly had
it with "Hounds of Love." Just because I think an album is fantastic
doesn't mean that I can't still be disappointed in it, or think that other
albums are better.

Some would argue that TSW is perfect; perhaps so - but if so, then HoL and
TD are simply a little *more* perfect, is all. :-)

                                            - Ray R.


PS - For what it's worth, I "came aboard" Way Back When with "The Kick
Inside."
