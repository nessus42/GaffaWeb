At the risk of someone already having said this (I am still catching up),
let's see why the following statement might be true:

&gt; Suppose we divide fans into those who discovered Kate at 'The Dreaming/
&gt; Hounds of Love' stage, and those who discovered her at the beginning.
&gt; Would it be correct to say that the former are the ones who are 'a little
&gt; disappointed with _TSW_'?  No evidence, no flames, just a thought... :-)

There are various cases to consider:

Let P be some person.

a) P knew of, but did not particularly catch on to Kate's first three albums,
   but was enamored to the point of orgasm by Dreaming, and HoL a few years
   later.

b) P did not know of Kate *at all* until, say, TD (less likely), or
   HoL (more likely, for Americans anyways).

These are obviously two classes of people who "discovered" Kate at the
TD/HoL juncture.

If the premise of the above (&gt;&gt;&gt;) statement is that TD and HoL were 
(hold on to your seedcakes) *better* (in some ethereal way) than
first 3, then person a), it may be argued, would be expected to 
"not like as much but still like alot" TSW.
This is an hypothesis.

However, if the &gt;&gt;&gt; statement were referring to people in class b) (myself
among them), who picked up on Kate at a mid-80's juncture, and then
were retrospectively exposed to her earlier work, there is no saying
whether they might like that as much or not, and therefore the &gt;&gt;&gt; stmt.
would seem to be possibly invalid.


just some food for thought
