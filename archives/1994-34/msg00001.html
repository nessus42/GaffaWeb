Archive-name: music/kate-bush-faq-diffs
Last-modified: 1994/10/13
Version: 1.1.m minus 1.1.l

This FAQ is a bit early, since I'm on holiday and wouldn't be able to post
it on it's scheduled time.

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action. The full version is posted to
rec.music.gaffa only. You can get a full copy of the FAQ by requesting it from
me (uli@zoodle.robin.de). If you subscribe to the list (done by sending
email to love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net) Bill Wisner will also provide you
with the full FAQ. If you can't receive more than 64KB in one piece I can
split the FAQ for you.

ATTENTION: since I'm on holiday I can't provide the full version right now.
If it's urgent you can request it from Bill Wisner (love-hounds-request@...).

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.

-------------------8&lt;-------------------

2.1. Who is Happy Rhodes?
  

     Also available is the IRC channel #ecto where at most times you can find
     some Ectophiles and #Ectophiles.
[see you there]

     Please note that Happy prefers it if you buy the albums in a normal shop.

[well, no more signed CDs. Happy doesn't have time for this anymore. Sniff...]
  

4.2. Tours

     1995:  Wanted to tour with just her and a piano, but was told that this
            would fuel those frequent comparisons between her and Tori Amos.

[I found out why there won't be a tour in 1995 either...]
  

     Early in November the next set of singles will appear, again in the UK
     only: And So Is Love. Two CD singles (regular and a box with prints) and a
     7" in a picture sleeve will appear.

[To US subscribers: go hunting those import shops!]

     A good short description of the contents of Kate's new 43 minute film
     The Line, The Cross &amp; The Curve are the lyrics to the title song of The
     Red Shoes. The film will finally appear on video: UK and US is scheduled
     for October, Japan for December. All three releases will be available on
     VHS and LaserDisc.

[a little bit better (though not yet exact) release dates, and I finally looked
onto the clock while watching my video of this one for the umptiest time...
(thanks again, Kimmo!)]

4.4. Basic Discography/Videography

     Albums and other major collections:

     The Cathy Demos (30 early songs, ca. 1975-77???, a MUST for every fan)
        Five of these are demos of songs that later appeared on albums.
        They are available on various bootlegs. (Anybody have an early 80's
        album called THE EARLY YEARS?).

[again, I finally counted them]

     Also soon to appear: the US dance remix of Rubberband Girl which was also
     played at the Convention. It is said to be not very different from
     previous stuff. (Haven't heard it yet.) It will appear as a b-side for
     And So Is Love.

[yeah!]
  

     Kate Bush Club (KBC):
[...]

[It's at least "SAE 8" now, I've been too busy to keep up with the KBC]
  

Bye,

Uli
