&gt;&gt; &gt;I seem to be one of very few who agree with you. While MoP is very well
&gt;&gt; &gt;made, I think its too much sentimental crap. Top of the City isn't one
&gt;&gt; &gt;of my favourites either. WSILY on the other hand is good, and so is 
&gt;&gt; &gt;Constellation of the heart, and Big Stripey Lie too...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;   Have to disagree with you.  The Red Shoes, when it came out, helped me a
&gt;&gt; lot when I was feeling very down (even for me).  Top of the City and MoP
&gt;&gt; are easily the two songs that helped me most.
&gt;
&gt;	I agree completely.  Top of the City was the first song on the 
&gt;album to really make me bawl.  It had me crying and shaking and 
&gt;completely a wreck for a number of weeks...and although Moments of 
&gt;pleasure has never made me completely break down, it does make me feel a 
&gt;little bit weak.
&gt;	It seems to me like a lot of people are still looking for faults 
&gt;in the Red Shoes--I admit, when it first came out, it was hard for me to 
&gt;relate to in it's entirety.  But, in that way, it's like all Kate 
&gt;albums...they seem to be easily dismissed, and then to come and jump you 
&gt;from behind when you most need them.  
&gt;	I'd also like to defend You're the ONly One, which seems to get 
&gt;some terrible things said about it from time to time.  It sounds very 
&gt;commercial and expresses very basic sentiments, which can be offputting 
&gt;at times, but the emotions sung about in the song are so obviously and 
&gt;genuinely felt i cannot help but be moved by it.
&gt;
&gt;kate always,

  Both TotC and MoP deal, to some degree, with death and suicidal urges. 
Seeing the world very darkly, this is the sort of thing I can truly relate
to.  Hearing these was like being able to talk about such things,
something rarely possible for someone like myself.
  I think it's just a matter of different people being able to relate to
different songs.  Rather than a negative thing, it's positive.  It
confirms the variety that makes life so enjoyable.
