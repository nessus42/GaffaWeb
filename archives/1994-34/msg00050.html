Hi,
 
IED writes:
 
&gt; Marcel Rijs asks whether anyone would like to send him a PAL copy
&gt; of all the Fruitopia ads.  As IED has now had several other
&gt; requests for same (from Europe-based Love-Hounds), and is sure
&gt; there are many U.S. fans who would be interested, he suggests
&gt; that a Love-Hounds Collection Volume 2 might well be in order
&gt; sooner rather than later (?). Thoughts on the subject, anyone?
&gt;
&gt; The video for "The Man I Love" would be a welcome addition (does
&gt; anyone have it?), as well as Kate's recent appearance on the UK
&gt; children's programme, "Record Breakers", which was supposed to
&gt; have aired on October 7th (did no one see it? Will anyone report
&gt; on it?) That said, let us move on to the issue at hand:
&gt; FRUITOPIA: A LIST OF KATE BUSH-SCORED COMMERCIAL FILMS
[...]
 
First of all, many thanks to IED for this rather descriptive
checklist - I was very pleased to read it and will keep it as an
encyclopedia for many years to come.
 
As for the "Love-Hounds Collection Volume 2" I have a proposal
which might interest many of you.
IED has spoken in the past of a chronological video collection to
be made from the beginning of Kate's career until the end, which
will, hopefully, be far away from us yet, so in the mean time let's
use the term "now".
In this suggested tape-tree we might as well try and take an
advance on that, by making a video totally devoted to "The red
shoes". Therefore, this tape should include every KT-related
program from 1993 and 1994. We may assume there won't be much more
to come, but if it does it can of course be included.
Now, what should be included on this tape, apart from the above-
mentioned Fruitopia commercials? Here's an effort to an inventory:
 
- Kate's appearance at "Aspel &amp; Company" (of course).
- The U.S. clip of "Rubberband girl" - one may assume the other
(UK) clips should also be a part of this collection, but they're
included in the TLTC&amp;TC film which is now available commercially so
it wouldn't be a good idea to include the film. If we'd decide to
do it despite the moral objections, we should of course use the
Swedish TV version...
- The "The man I love" clip
- Kate's telephone interview on MTV Europe's "Most wanted", a show
hosted by Ray Cokes. He shows the highly unaffordable promo red box
"Red shoes" promo, as well as talking to the Goddess herself, at a
time where she's still working on the film.
- Kate's appearance at the London film festival... I for one have
a short bootleg video (about 5 minutes - maybe longer) where she
arrives, presents the film and leaves the scene. It's like being
there.
- Random reviews, interviews and material from the Red Shoes
period. I know there isn't much around, but we should at least be
able to fill one 120-minute tape.
 
Thoughts, anyone?
