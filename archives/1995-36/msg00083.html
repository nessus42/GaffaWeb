Dear fellow lovehounders-

        Now, I realize this has nothing to do with Marmite, but i really
couldn't resist forwarding this... i don't know if it's real or not, but i know
these cookies sound yummy, and i'm going to try them out for my thanksgiving
table (which will feature turkey, along with some fabulously complex vegitarian
dishes) so, enjoy!


Subject: Cookie recipie. $250 worth. (fwd)

This is completely bogus, but I made the cookies a few years ago, and they are
excellent.....like you wouldn't believe!!!!!

&gt;
&gt;Okay, everyone....a true story of justice in the good old U.S. of A.
&gt;Thought y'all might enjoy this; if nothing else, it shows internet
&gt;justice, if it can be called that.
&gt;
&gt;My daughter &amp; I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe
&gt;in Dallas &amp; decided to have a small dessert.  Because our family are
&gt;such cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus Cookie". It was
&gt;so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and they said
&gt;with a small frown, "I'm afraid not."  Well, I said, would you let me
&gt;buy the recipe? With a cute smile, she said, "Yes."  I asked how much,
&gt;and she responded, "Two fifty." I said with approval, just add it to
&gt;my tab.
&gt;
&gt;Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and
&gt;it was $285.00.  I looked again and I remembered I had only spent $9.95
&gt;for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf.  As I glanced at the bottom
&gt;of the statement, it said, "Cookie Recipe - $250.00."  Boy, was I upset!
&gt;I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it
&gt;was "two fifty," and I did not realize she meant $250.00 for a cookie
&gt;recipe.
&gt;
&gt;I asked them to take back the recipe and reduce my bill and they said
&gt;they were sorry, but because all the recipes were this expensive so not
&gt;just everyone could duplicate any of our bakery recipes....the bill
&gt;would stand.
&gt;
&gt;I waited, thinking of how I could get even or even try and get any of
&gt;my money back.
&gt;
&gt;I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250.00 and now I'm going to have
&gt;$250.00 worth of fun." I told her that I was going to see to it that
&gt;every cookie lover will have a $250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus
&gt;for nothing. She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this." I said, "I'm
&gt;sorry but this is the only way I feel I could get even," and I will.
&gt;
&gt;So, here it is, and please pass it to someone else or run a few
&gt;copies....I paid for it; now you can have it for free.
&gt;
&gt;                    (Recipe may be halved.):
&gt;
&gt;      2  cups butter                     4  cups flower
&gt;      2  tsp. soda                       2  cups sugar
&gt;      5  cups blended oatmeal**         24 oz. chocolate chips
&gt;      2  cups brown sugar                1  tsp. salt
&gt;      1  8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated)      4  eggs
&gt;      2  tsp. baking powder              3 cups chopped nuts (your
&gt;      2  tsp. vanilla                      choice)
&gt;
&gt;        ** measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.
&gt;           Cream the butter and both sugars.  Add eggs and vanilla;
&gt;           mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and
&gt;           soda. Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.  Roll into
&gt;           balls and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet.  Bake
&gt;           for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.  Makes 112 cookies.
&gt;
&gt;Have fun!!!  This is not a joke --- this is a true story..
&gt;

&gt;That's it. Please, pass it along to everyone you know, single people,
&gt;mailing lists, etc....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ride free, citizen!
