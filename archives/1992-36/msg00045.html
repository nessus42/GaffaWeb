Chris here,

    Someone else's post may beat this one but here goes:

   Peter Gabriel guest-hosted Empty-Vee's _120 Minutes_ this evening.
A string of guest hosts have replaced the hated Dave (insert nickname
here) Kendall. This would be a Good Thing if the host had any input
into the selection of the music, but sadly the host just introduces
the same lame stuff that would be played otherwise.

   Returning from a break we were treated to a snippet of Peter's
duet with our beloved, _Don't Give Up_. He had this to say about the
experience of making this video, which consists entirely of one shot
of Kate and Peter slowly rotating, as they hug and caress one another -

  "Sometimes you really have to suffer when making videos.
   Kate Bush, who you just saw there, is believed to have an album
   out in late spring - and if you believe that you'll believe
   anything becuause she's actually one of the artists who's
   slower than I am, and it's reassuring to know that they exist.

   A few fun facts about this video; it was made by the groundbreaking
team of Godley and Creme, formerly one half (the smart half) of 10cc.
Godley and Creme, along with a couple of other directors like Tim Pope,
lifted the music video from the morass of "band-in-a-box" that was MTV
in the early 1980s. G&amp;C had explored rapid editing in the video to
Rob Junklas' _Boy's Town_, and had taken it to the extreme in the
video to Wang Chung's _Everybody Have Fun Tonight_, editing on every
single frame. Realizing that they had wrung the art of editing dry,
G&amp;C decided to make _Don't Give Up_ without any edits at all. One
continuous shot, slowly zooming in and back, with close-ups handled
by rotating the preformers. The result is moving and simple, but the
record company, accustomed to rapid-fire editing and wiz-bang effects
were baffled. So completely lost that they commisioned a *second*
video made from footage that looks like an out-take from Fleetwood
Mac's _Gypsy_.

   If you look closely, you can see that, in order to hug Peter
properly, Our Kate is standing on a *very discreet* box, almost
but not quite, covered by her long skirt.

                          Chris Williams of
                            Chris'n'Vickie of Chicago
                            chrisw@fciad2.bsd.uchicago.edu (his)
                            vickie@njin.rutegrs.edu (hers)
