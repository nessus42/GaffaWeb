Chris here,

In article &lt;<A HREF="msg00034.html">18271620@um.cc.umich.edu</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;Hi everyone!
&gt;Finals are drawing near, and I am so excited about being able to read for
&gt;PLEASURE (ie no biology!!) over Christmas break that I am PLANNING what I
&gt;will devour first.

   Biology not pleasurable? Gee, I do a lot of biological things and
enjoy them a quite a bit. ;-)       

&gt;My goal is to read everything KaTe has ever alluded to in her songs.
&gt;So far my list looks like this:
&gt;Wuthering Heights
&gt;Ulysses
&gt;A Book of Dreams
&gt;The Hunchback of Norte Dame
&gt;I mean Notre
&gt;And movies...
&gt;Night of the Demon 
 
  The alternative title is "Curse of the Demon." This film doesn't really
have all that much to do with _Hounds of Love_, other than providing "...it's
in the trees, it's coming!" and the time frame of the video.

&gt;The Innocents

   To date, this has not been released on video. Cinemax was showing a
really nice print of it a couple of years ago. You might add "The Turn
of the Screw" to the books and stories list.

&gt;I know must be missing some.  Thanks!

   Well those are the comfirmed list, but there are others - 

_The Shining_ (book) - Kate has said that the book was one of the few she
has read that really scared her, and the the idea of a *place* posessing
and evil sprit inspired _Get Out of My House_. Also the film _The Haunting_.

_Hanussen_ (movie) - My friend Kim Pierceall told me about this one, and I
managed to find it on videotape. I believe it was the basis for _Heads were
Dancing_ and I want *someone* to watch this. It's a good film.

_Nosferatu_ (movie) - The male chourus in _Hello Earth_ is from the soundtrack
of this film. Kate contacted Werner Herzog to borrow it.

_Delius_ (movie) - This one would be the hardest one to find. It's by Ken
Russell, and Kate appeared on a chat show with Delius' colaborator Eric
Fenby (...in "B" Fenby) to talk about the film. We've never seen the entire
thing.

_She's Having a Baby_ - If only to hear _This Woman's Work_ in context.
It's an enjoyable film, if not in the league of some of the others on
this list.

and (reaching) _The Godfather_ - Kate has said that _Between a Man and a
Woman_ was inspired by a scene from this film.

_The Magician of Lublin_ didn't inspire Kate, and in fact she was just a
"voice-for-hire" on someone elses song on this sound track.

...and of course, Kate's soundtrack and acting debuts, the two episodes
of _The Comic Strip_.

&gt;Back to my bio book :(
&gt;Elisabeth

   Hey, if you want to travel from Michigan to Chicago we could have a
Kate movie marathon. Give us a call, or e-mail.
