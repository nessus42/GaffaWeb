In answer to Andrew's question I went to my faithful and trusty "Brewer 
the Dictionary of Phrase and Fable" originally published in the late 19th 
century. Under the entry OM: 
        A sanscrit word, somewhat similar to Amen. When the gods are 
asked to rejoice in sacrifice, the god Savitri cries out Om (be it so). 
When Pravahan is asked if his father has instructed him, he answers Om 
(Verily). Brahmans begin and end their lessons on the Veda with the word 
Om, for "unless Om precedes his lecture, it will be like water on a rock, 
which cannot be gathered up; and unless it concludes the lecture, it will 
bring forth no fruit."
        Om mani padem (umlates over the e) hum (circumflex over the u). 
These are the first six syllables taught the children of Tibet and 
Mongolia, and the last words uttered by the dying in those lands. It is 
met with everywhere as a charm.

Brewer also had an interesting entry for "Waking a Witch":
        If a "witch" was obdurate, the most effectual way of obtaining a 
confession was by what was termed "waking her." For this purpose an iron 
bridle or hoop was bound across her face with four prongs thrust into her 
mouth. The "bridle" was fastened behind to the wall by a chain in such a 
manner that the victim was unable to lie down; and in this position she 
was kept sometimes for several days, while men were constantly by to keep 
her awake. In Scotland some of these bridles are still preserved.

Makes you wonder..has Kate been visiting Scottish torture museums???
or better yet does she secretly hold a degree in Medieval Studies??
One can only hope for the latter. 8)

P.S.
  have I already gone through the similarities between Hounds of Love, 
Ruunning Up that Hill and Dante's Inferno? Or Love and Anger and the Tale 
of Parzifal?? KAte is sooo medieval...scary.
