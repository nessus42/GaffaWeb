 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: New KT bootleg available

     IED is referring to a seven-inch single featuring (on the a-side)
Kate's live performance of _Moving_ from the Seventh Tokyo Song
Festival, which was held at the Budokan on June 18, 1978. On
the b-side are Kate's performances of abridged versions of two
Beatles songs, _The_Long_and_Winding_Road_ and _She's_Leaving_Home_.
The latter two songs were taped at Tokyo's TBS G Studio on June 23, 1978,
for airing on the programme _Sound_in_S_. All three songs are
accompanied by a large orchestral group (including full string and
wind sections), and for _She's_Leaving_Home_ Kate pre-recorded her
own background choruses.
     The sound is surprisingly good, and is in stereo (although it
may be simply a stereo recording of the original mono tracks). There
is a good deal of "toppiness" to the sound (distortion of the higher
frequencies), but for the most part the recordings are quite listenable.
     The cover is of hard, glossy card-stock, with a close-up copy of a
1978 publicity shot of Kate on the front, and a copy of the close-up of
the "radiating eye" from the front cover of the official UK single
release of _The_Man_With_the_Child_in_His_Eyes_ on the back.
     Kate's performances are extremely professional, with no
hint of uncertainty about intonation or anything--although at
the very end of _She's_Leaving_Home_ Kate finishes a beat later
than the arrangement evidently indicated, a mistake no doubt prompted
by what must have been minimal rehearsal time and poor orchestral
direction. (Anyway, the error does not damage the performance, since
the arrangement ends at that point.) Kate's voice is at its most
spectacularly _high-pitched_ in all three performances, and she
does manage to add two or three interesting little melodic flourishes
to the Beatles songs, despite their abbreviated length.
     All in all, IED agrees completely with Peter FitzGerald-Morris, who
called this bootleg "a treasure". IED found his at a So. Cal. record swap
meet this weekend, and paid what he felt was a reasonable $10.00.
