In article &lt;8080@orstcs.CS.ORST.EDU&gt; Rajeev Pandey might have written (but
might instead have had his account broken or his name otherwise forged,
or in fact have spoken into a word recognizer and not written at all, or
even tripped a sparking motor in the ball of his thumb):

&gt;  Question: Does anyone out there know what the picture on the back cover of
&gt;	    "The Whole Story" is of ???

It is Kate's model of the "Cloudbuster", a device created by Wilhelm
Reich for the purpose of creating rain by manipulation of orgone
energy.  The evidence for its functioning is generally considered weak
enough to merit the label of "crackpot", a label in which TIM concurs.

The model may have been used in a video presentation of the song
"Cloudbusting", but as TIM has already stated, he finds Ms. Bush's
expressions so sophomoric that he avoids viewing her videos.  This
opinion was recently reinforced by a viewing of Peter Gabriel's CV, in
which Ms. Bush appears in a segment directed by Godley and Creme and
utterly spoils the segment with her hamming.  The video is so bad that
another presentation of the song, omitting Ms. Bush, was later shot.

TIM would further like it known that his middle name is John, which
begins with J, a Western stylization of the Roman letter I in the
initial position, and therefore his initials may rightly be given as
TIM.  He would further mention that reference to oneself in the third
person is a common feature of crackpottery (cf. Martin Gardner, FADS
AND FALLACIES IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE).
