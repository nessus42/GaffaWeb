  The BBC 2 programme "Rhythms of the World" is showing the
episode "The Music of Bulgaria" this coming saturday (11/3/89
at 8.05pm). Here is the blurb from the Radio Times:

        Tonight's programme features a wide range of popular traditional
   music from Bulgaria. The Bulgarians are passionate about music -
   it is part of their national identity - and their songs deal with
   every aspect of people's lives. Like many music lovers in the
   West, pop star Kate Bush has only recently discovered the intensity
   and richness of Bulgarian music. Last October "Rhythms of the World"
   filmed her at work in the recording studio with three of Bulgaria's
   leading female vocalists, Trio Bulgarka. They provide a fascinating
   insight into a living musical tradition and show why their
   mesmerising harmonies are captivating British audiences. Their
   success here has led to sell-out tours, an appearance on Wogan
   and album chart success.
        Also included is the furious bop-inspired playing of another
   major Bulgarian star, Ivo Papasov. He first appeared on stage at the
   age of 13. Since then he has been developing a unique style which
   blends hard jazz with traditional Bulgarian gypsy music.

  There is also a picture of Kate with the trio (similar, if not
identical to the one that appeared in NME) with caption: "East meets
West...Bulgaria's traditional Trio Bulgarka with English
songbird Kate Bush".
  From this description it almost sounds as if the programme is
as much about Kate as the Trio. However, this may just be a way
of attracting a bigger audience. I will certainly let you know
how the show turns out.
Regards,
