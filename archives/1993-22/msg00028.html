&gt;&gt; As a guitarist, Prince is pretty consistently excellent.  As a songwriter,
&gt;&gt; he's hit and miss, I'll grant.  As a producer, he's done some very good
&gt;&gt; work too, and to be honest, I was pretty unimpressed with the production
&gt;&gt; on Kate's last album, so I'd say it could be a very good thing to have
&gt;&gt; Prince on board in that capacity.
&gt;    Actually, my first intro to Kate was The Sensual World.    I was 
&gt;quite impressed with the production on it...enough so I went out and got 
&gt;all her other albums, started getting onto chats about her, etc, etc.

All I can say is I'm amazed yet again that people are impressed with
that album.

&gt;&gt; &gt;information, and don't feel he would be a help.    Am I willing to be 
&gt;&gt; &gt;proven wrong on the matter of his harming the new album ??  Yes, I would.
&gt;&gt; You sure don't sound very open to the idea.
&gt;     Actually I'm quite open to the idea...I'm willing to admit that 
&gt;prince might not be a hinderance to The Red Shoes, and that, while I feel 
&gt;he do more harm than good, I am willing to be proven wrong.  (as a matter 
&gt;of fact, I'd love to be proven wrong, as I'd hate The Red Shoes to be a 
&gt;dissappointment.)

Yes, such openness to state all these things in the negative "that prince
*might not* be a hindrance".  Such complete openness has yet to be
surpassed by anyone.

&gt;   On a personal note, I noted that most of your defence of prince is 
&gt;more geared as attacks on me and my musical taste.    Since I have stated 
&gt;that these are my opinions, that others may feel differently, (as you 
&gt;seem to), may I ask that your comments regarding this matter be confined 
&gt;to discussing the matter, w/o personal attacks.    I have not attacked 
&gt;your musical taste in any way, please do not attack mine.

I don't know, I'd say calling an artist that I like "trash" is something
of an attack.


I suspect that if there is going to be any disappointment in _The Red Shoes_
it won't be due to Prince's influence.  After all, he didn't influence my
disappointment in the last album....

               The animal that coils in a circle is the serpent;
   that's why so many cults and myths of the serpent exist, because it's hard
      to represent the return of the sun by the coiling of a hippopotamus.
