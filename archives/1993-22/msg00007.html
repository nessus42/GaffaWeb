Just a few initial thoughts on the Aspel &amp; Co. appearance. The interview
itself did not shed much new light (and other kind soles have already
posted transcriptions) but it was interesting to discover that it was
actually meeting Michael Powell that inspired Kate as much as the film
itself.

During the group interview sections of the programme I felt that Kate
was a bit overwhelmed by being surrounded by Leeny Henry and Victoria
Wood who can both talk the hind legs of a donkey. Aspel tried to get
her back into the conversation but without much success.

As for the song well my opinion is that if it is indicative of the
album as a whole then it means The Sensual World Part II. The song Moments
of Pleasure reminded be very much of a cross between This Woman's Work
and Reaching Out but it may be that the orchestration on the track on
the TV show was not the album version. Besides the strings and piano
there were some seagull noises! Lyrically the song was clearly very emotional
and powerful (reflecting the subject matter that Peter described last week)
with some fascinating insights into Kate's personal world. Examples such
as an old saying her mother used to tell her ("an old sock always finds
an old shoe) and that Al Murphy was known to her as Smurf. There were enough
rhythmic changes in the song to give Kate's vocal range a good working
out and she sounded on good form.

I think we are in for an even more personal album then the TSW - which
is perhaps inevitable after Kate's loss of her mother and others close
to her. It will be very interesting to discover what kinds of songs
will be chosen as singles and the album itself will I am sure be full
of surprises.
