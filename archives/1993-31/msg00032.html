Chris Williams replies: "It seems impossible for critics and most listeners to
describe female singers without comparing.....Now this would seem reasonable
enough, that comparisons are necessary....But look through any magazine...you
will notice that male singers are not often compared with one another...try to
find a review of a female singer without pigeon-hole comparisons...I am sometim
es guilty (of comparisons) but I try to avoid it, as not to belittle each woman
's individual talent."

I submit that everyone's opinion is biased due to everyone's unique experiences
and references on which they are based.  Therefore comparisons, opinions and
judgements are unavoidable.  You cannot like or dislike something without a fra
me of reference...no matter what the subject...and therein lies (IMO) the weakn
ess in your argument. You have not addressed the comparisons that do occur betw
een all other non-female subjects. You cannot say that comparisons between
women is "unconscious sexism" while not criticizing other comparisons. No one
would accuse me of "colourism" because I like red and dislike yellow. (I think
red is darker, richer, and much more attractive.)  Your reference to music
reviews points to sexual inequality which is present in most occupations.
However, please do not confuse sexism with sexual inequality...just as racism
is not the same as racial inequality. eg. Our Prime Minister, Kim Campbell is
often compared with Margaret Thatcher....due to a lack of other prominent role
models; the result of sexual inequality...not sexism.  Also, your charge of
sexism can be misconstrued to mean that you think that all female musicians/
singers deserve individual praise, without comparison.  This is simply untrue
and unrealistic. There are bad female singers...just as there are bad male
singers...and stupid pet tricks!  :)  You and I may disagree on a particular
male singer's merits....but thats ok....we are entitled...and in no way are
either of us belittling the one we do not like.  Comparisons clarify what each
individual likes or dislikes.  Now I hope that racial and sexual equality is
achieved...but I can still dislike Jane Siberry!  :)
