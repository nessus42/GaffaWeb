Vickie here.
I'm not going to get deeply involved in this thread (which I find 
pretty amusing) but my name was conjured up and so here I am.

K R Brownfield (Hi Ken!) writes:

&gt; What comes immediately to my mind is that female vocalists seem to
&gt; be much more popular than male vocalists. 

In which alternate universe? (Besides gaffa &amp; Ecto, I mean)

&gt; Especially in Europe, where the female vocalist &amp; "etherial" guitar 
&gt; bands are getting a lot of talk.

I'm curious, does this "talk" you speak of translate into solid sales
and *equal* airplay on the radio?

&gt; If I say that Happy Rhodes' upper range is a near-dead-ringer
&gt; for Kate's, is that an insult because I can't think of a single
&gt; bloody singer that's similar to Black Francis? 

No, of course not. Then again, Happy's upper range *is* a near-dead-
ringer for Kate's, so this example isn't a good one.

&gt; Now, before my argument sinks too deep into anyone's head, I realize 
&gt; that _many_ readers of gaffa think that Kate is _the_ bees' knees,
&gt; Goddess, et.al..  While there is the extreme tendency to hail Kate 
&gt; over all else, strongly doubt that anyone here owns, likes, or favors
&gt; NO other female vocalists.  Vickie has at _least_ Happy Rhodes and 
&gt; Victoria Williams.  

And Jane Siberry, Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan and many, many more.
Kate *is* God though. Always and forever. Amen :-)

&gt; ...Kate/Tori comparison. They are similar in some ways, different in
&gt; many others.  In explaining the style of Tori, how could the mention of
&gt; Kate Bush, an admitted major influence on Tori's style, be insulting?

Who "admitted" that Kate's a major influence on Tori's style? Not Tori.
She likes Kate, but hasn't really been influenced all that much by her.

&gt; Besides the fact that the comparison is helpful for an explanation, 
&gt; the similarity is quite obvious.

Very obvious. They're both 4I. (Intelligent, Interesting, Innovative
and Independent). 

&gt; Tori is similar to Kate.  This gives me a bloody ROUGH idea of how she
&gt; sings.  And owning her album, I'll say that anyone who denies the 
&gt; hints and breezes of similarity is deluding themselves and ignoring 
&gt; Tori's art.

No Ken, I hear no hints and breezes of similarity between Tori's music 
and Kate's music, except that I love the music of both artists.

I hear no hints and breezes of similarity between Tori's voice and Kate's
voice, except that I love the voices of both artists.

I hear no hints and breezes of similarity between Tori's lyrics and Kate's
lyrics, except that I find them all interesting.

I love Kate, and I love Tori.

I'm not deluding myself and I'm not ignoring Tori's art.
