Brett responds, "I think Chris' point was more along the following lines: we
never hear or read comments like "Peter Gabriel is one of England's finest male
songwriters"..yet I always seem to be ncountering this sort of qualification in
discussions of female songwriters (and writers and filmmakers and painters etc.
).  If I take hime right...he thinks this macks of sexism.   I would tend to
agree."

Hi Brett.  About your "qualifications in discussions of female songwriters (and
writers and filmakers and painters etc.)......haven't you read the well worn
cliche, One of the Year's Ten Best"....used to describe fils and filmakers,  bo
books and authors....etc. etc.????   I think you will see similar uses of that
"qualification" in many articles which review "Male" artists.  I think that you
only notice the one's referring to "Female" artists more...because they are
rarer...and thus stand out in a crowd.  In the case of film...there are simply
far more men in the industry....that is...in positions of power and influence.
This is a case of sexual inequality.....not sexism.  Now if a reviewer were to
go on and on about a female artist's physical attribute, or try and draw some
relationship between her talent and her sex.....then THAT would be sexism.

B.T.W.  Chris was not limiting his position to "professional critics".critics.
...and I quote, "It seems impossible for critics and most listeners to describe
female singers withoutcomparing one to another....."

If you've read my note Brett, you already know my position. Comparisons between
singers are not a case of sexism
