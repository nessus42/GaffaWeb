  Well, folks, today turned out to be a truly interesting and wonderful
day. Sorry if I bore anybody, but I just wanted to share what happened.
  My husband left early this a.m. on a business trip. This is the first
time he's been away since we were married less than a month ago, so I've
spent most of the day in a really deep blue funk.
  This evening I decided to see if I could find the KaTe videos you've all
been telling me about at any of the music stores hereabouts. No one carried
them, but I was able to special order the videos for _The Whole Story_ and
_The Sensual World_. Now I'm chomping at the proverbial bit, as I have to 
wait at least 4 weeks to see them.

   BUT! While I was there, I found a copy of _Aspects of the Sensual World_.


    OH, HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY DAY!

I've listened to it 3 times already. "I'm Still Waiting" is truly wonderful-
I was hooked from the first minute I started listening to it. "Ken" is just
plain outrageous- I don't know how else to describe it. I'm not sure yet
about "Be Kind To My Mistakes"- I need to listen to it a few more times to
decide where it fits in my KaTe KaTegories. As for "The Sensual World" 
Instrumental Mix- ......wow...... it's what I call "bubble bath-and-candles"
music.

  Thanks to all of you who told me about KaTe videos, _Aspects_, etc. I
never would have even known to look for them if it wasn't for you guys!

  You know, having New KaTe (or ANY KaTe, for that matter) to listen to
is not quite as incredible as making love to the right person, but it's
so close that I often have a hard time telling the difference.... (no
need to tease me about that one, thank you....)

  Just out of curiosity... has anyone ever written to KaTe, and if so,
has she ever replied? I realize she probably gets tons of so-called "fan
mail" (as well she should!), but....

  Better yet- for those of you who have gone to KonvenTion, etc. and have
the blessed experience of actually MEETING her, is she as wonderful, incredible,fantastic, outrageous, talented, intelligent, beautiful, and unearthly
trancendent, etc. as she appears to be through her music? (If this is a silly
question, please forgive me. I'm just a lowly ignorant love-hound neophyte.)

  'Til next time,

                          *I'm Still Waiting*

                                 judi
