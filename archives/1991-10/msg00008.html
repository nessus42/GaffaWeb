&gt;Has Kate, in any of her TD era interview, ever explained the meaning behind
&gt;"Get Out of My House"? It's one of my favorite songs, but I have no idea what
&gt;she is talking about.


I remember a long discussion about this song a fairly long time ago.  I
don't have any interviews about "GOoMH" myself, though I remember someone
posting something where she talked about the meaning of the mule.

The way I interpret the song is that the woman has just had an argument
with the man, and he's left the house.  In her anger, she has become
stubborn, and refuses to talk to him.  At the end of the song, the two
have a duel of sorts, much like on the old Disney film, "The Sword in the
Stone," in which they keep changing shapes to "defeat" each other.  Eventually
the woman shows the ultimate in stubborness--"I change into the Mule," a
traditionally stubborn animal.

Overall, the song shows the danger of being stubborn instead of communicative.
 
&gt;I have an interview (thanks woj!) where this bozo interviewer asks her to
&gt;explain the meaning behind "There goes a Tenner" and "The Dreaming"!!!!! What
&gt;a moron - just read the lyrics! If he had time he probably would have asked 
&gt;about "Houdini"! 

Oh come on!  Just read the lyrics to "Get Out of My House"!!

I'll grant you that "There Goes a Tenner" is fairly simple; the only interview
I've heard in which it's discussed involves the interviewer trying to tack
something about the song being a parallel to KaTe's career, which she
ripped apart and then said "It's just about a bank robbery."

I could understand "The Dreaming" being completely uninterpretable to 
someone who knows little about Britain's takeover of Australia.

As for "Houdini," well, sure I'd had a pretty good idea of what the song
was about before I bought an interview disc on which she discusses it.
But she *completely* changed the way I understand and react to that song.
I used to think it was pretty neat.  Now I got chills when I listen to it.
I didn't know who Rosabelle was, I didn't know that Houdini had set up a code
with his wife.  The song means an incredible amount to me now.  Wow.
