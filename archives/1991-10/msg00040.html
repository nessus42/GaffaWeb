&gt;I too, am not all that crazy about Lionheart.  It's a good album, I think, but
&gt;not great.  Much of it seems to me to be very much like the _Kick Inside_ 
&gt;stuff but just not as well written.  In fact, to be honest, it sounds to me 
&gt;like someof the stuff could have been written for the _Kick Inside_ but just 
&gt;not used for that album because she had too many songs to fit on one album.  
&gt;Does anyone know if there's any truth to this?

Um, sort of.  I'm sure I have some of the details wrong, and I know that
IED and others will correct me, but here goes...

By the time TKI came out, KaTe had something like 200 songs she'd written.
I dunno how many of these were good enough to be considered for either
album.  Certainly some of the early songs did show up later, as evidenced
by the versions available as the Cathy Demos--"Violin", "Babooshka," and
"Kashka" spring to mind (as the only Demos I have, other than a tape
of "Organic Acid" and "Scares Me Silly" is the _If You Could See Me Fly_ CD).

In any event, EMI was, shall we say, a wee bit pleased with the performance
of TKI in the charts, and they wanted to capitalize on KaTe's popularity
before she started to fade in the minds of the consumers.  They pressured
her into releasing _Lionheart_ far earlier than she would have liked.  

TKI was released in February of '78 ("Wuthering Heights," the first 
single, came out in late '77).  _Lionheart_ was released in December
of '78.

I can't imagine what it would be like to have two Kate Bush albums come out
in one year.

Wow.
