re: Lionheart
-------------
Since I originally asked about the merits of Lionheart there have
been a number of interesting replies.  I guess I should clarify
why I don't really like the album, while also replying to some
specific comments people have made.

First, I suppose I should clarify what I mean when I say I don't "like"
LH.  For me it is precisely the "slips and hitches" that Kirstin mentions
as making the lp good that turn me off.  There seems to be so much
potential in the album, yet in almost every song she does something that
just seems...I don't know (fear of being flamed here)...well, *silly*.
For example, I find it silly every time I here her going on and on
with all those "wows".  Maybe silly isn't really the right word.  When
I listen to LH I hear so much potential, but the compositions just don't
hang together.  Each one seems to have some sort of niave poorly though-out
element to it.  (Oh god, I can't believe I'm saying this on rec.gaffa of
all places!!! IMVHO IMVHO IMVHO). I DO find great value and I am terribly
and continually impressed with the innovations and risks she takes with this
album.  But...I just don't think it works a lot of the time.

But yes, of course Jeff, I can certainly hear the "glimmer of what would
later become The Dreaming in songs like Coffee Homeground".  And of
course I'm *interested* in the album as "part of the artistic progression..."
But interest isn't necessarily the same as enjoyment.

THere are, however, many parts of LH I truly enjoy...indeed, in EVERY song
there is some parts I like.  (Actually, O England... IS one of my favorite
KaTe songs of all time!!)  But the songs as whole compositions just
seem to be lacking (IMVVVVHO).

I guess I'd also like to hear from those of you who do NOT like
Lionheart.  Why don't you?


(You know, maybe it's not that I "dislike" LH.  Perhaps it's more
accurate to say that I have a lot of mixed feelings about LH - unlike
her other albums, which I think are simply wonderful).

re: Get Out of My House
-----------------------
On another note:  Jeff Burka gave an interesting interpretation of Get Out
of My House.  I find it particularly interesting because I've always had
a sense of that song that is the opposite of Jeff's.  I've heard it as,
yes a song of anger,  but anger in a positive sense.  A woman has
stuggled to define herself - her boundaries (symbolized as the house) -
and has finally come to terms with the legitimacy and power of her anger
towards this man (the oppression of all men {?}).  She embraces
that anger and is thus able to define
herself as separate.  The man tries to insidiuosly make his way back
to his previous position, but she becomes the mule - a defiant and
powerful stance - something that, try as he may, will not be moved.
I've seen GOoMY as a wonderfully feminist song.  I don't think anger is
necessarily a bad thing -- A volcano is destructive perhaps, but what is
left is an incredibly fertile earth (paraphrase of Susan Griffin).
Has KaTe ever explained this song?

re:Deifying Kate
----------------
Finally....poor poor Dave Neff.  I read his post re: Why Deify Kate?  I
can hear the flame throwers charging up all over the gaffa world!
