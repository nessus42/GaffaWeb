I honestly believe that the synchronicity of circumstances that brought
my life's continuum into contact with Kate should be termed a "Cosmic
Conspiracy".  Accidents such as those which brought Kate to me are to
me confirmations that "the hand a-moulding us" sho'nuff is on my side.

In 1979 on some late-night "Don Kirshner's Rock Concert" type of deal,
I caught most of Kate performing Wuthering Heights (may have been the
video, may have been a different performance)...I couldn't hear the words
well enough to tell even if the song (and hence the artist) was English,
but those chords, those notes, that voice, that musical environment,
struck a chord deep inside me, a message from "home", so to speak.  The
performance ended, no name was given, I had not the wherewithal to
pursue anything like sufficient research to track down this special
person, but she lived on, latent and dormant in my memory...having heard
the song only once, I could (when I remembered to) play it back in my
mind, but as the years went on and I was diverted, the memory was
somewhat shelved.

Then, circa 1985, I was watching the syndicated Night Flight, and they
were showing the Hammersmith concert.  Something rang true about that
incredible documentary, and as each song/performance unfolded, I knew
that I was back in touch...and then the performance-ending Wuthering
Heights, more poignant a reunion than that of Cathy herself and cruel
Heathcliff.  I now had a name, and I immediately procured every album
she had made.  The rest is history, and irretrievable commitment.   

As I write, I have just completed another level of music instruction 
for my son by writing out the words, with chords, to his favorite Kate
songs.  He will thus master the 24 major and minor triads while seeing
how a really gifted musician arranges them (it's not exactly "da blues"),
and will be able to play Kate songs (nothing like feeling you're 
actually participating in a great work of art!) as well.

Anyone wishing specific chord accompaniment charts to any Kate song
(The Dreaming may be a tough one) can let me know...I'm sure there are
books published already with this, but I'm willing to provide on a
case-by-case, ad hoc basis.  I could score out the melodies as well
but this will necessitate postal correspondence.  But the offer stands.
