Since I post here regularily I thought that I should post how I came to enjoy
Kate's music and persona? It was not an earth-shattering event, and I would not
now consider myself a *complete* fanaTiK.

About the time TWS was released we were doing Wuthering Heights in highschool.
I was 16 then. I was talking to someone about our musical tastes and she 
mentioned Kate Bush - who had recorded a song "Wuthering Heights". I was
vaguely interested, bought TWS - was sort of impressed. Then I saw (and
taped) the Laurie Brown interview with her. The monatge of images which they
put together (esp the clips from SiG) left an imprint on my subconcious. At 
that time, however I wasn't motivated to get her albums.
I occasionally put on TWS - enjoying about half of it.
Over the next few years, my musical tastes broadened and I frequented all the
used record stores. I kept passing on Kate Bush for some reason.

I think I bought my first Kate album only about a year ago. HoL I think. I
*liked* it. No instant emotional attachment. The next week I bought TD (they
were only $5). This album I liked from the first listen (esp SiG). On sub-
sequent listens it became one of my favorite albums in my collection. I bought
Lionheart at a record show a little later and was sort of let down by it, 
although I like it now. Same with TSW...

What really hooked me was when I started to trade videos with people on the
net. The Hammersmith concert (esp the last 2 songs) really hooked me. Her
smile at the end of "Oh England My Lionheart" - wow. And the leaping about
at the end of the show during the most beautiful guitar solo - it complements
the song *perfectly* I also traded for much of her european tv stuff and
various appearances. She was great - even though most of the interviewers
were either arogant or idiots. "Kate you're SO unusual" one guy must have
called her unusual about 10 times in 5 minutes!

I guess it took SEEING her to become the fan that I am now. I think that the
reason why I don't have a really strong emotional attachment to her work is
that when i was buying the Kate Bush albums, I was *completely* obsessed with
the sugarcubes. A 2 minute clip of Bjork being interviewed, coupled with a 10 
second clip of "Birthday" was all it took for me to buy everything I could by
them, psychoanalyze myself with relation to the band, etc - I was over the top
- luckily I found someone on the net who felt the same, otherwise I might be
in a rubber room now...

Don't get the wrong impression though...The Dreaming is the most played
album on my turntable and I really like all of her albums. But I never had
a "religious" experience or Konvertion. 

sorry about the length of this...I guess i got carried away...
