&gt;&gt;_Old Grey Whistle Test_ another favorite that combines a beautiful Kate with
&gt;&gt;dippy interviewers (Chris and I call them the "Twit Twins") and, though Kate
&gt;&gt;stays at the height of politeness, she manages to get in a few subtle zingers
&gt;&gt;of her own at these two dorks.
&gt;
&gt;The funny thing about these interviews, is that, from what I
&gt;understand, these guys are quite popular in England.


Hey, guys (and girls) lay off the Whistle Test! The show was the only
UK TV show to feature any half-decent music. As for the presenters -
Mark Ellen, David Hepworth and the legendary Andy Kershaw - well they
tried to create a relaxed humorous feel to the show rather than the
typical straight-laced BBC production.

Personally, I like the interview - it's great fun, though it comes over
better on screen than paper. I prefer interviewers to be informal
and non-reverential rather than arse-lickers. If Kate can't take a bit
of mickey-taking then she is in the wrong business. Besides if she really
did get angry then she might say something interesting instead of repeating
stuff the way she did in all the TSW interviews.

As for the didgeridoo reference - perhaps they thought the viewers might
like an explanation ... and wasn't Kate just pulling their leg with the
muffled comment?


And talking of humour ...

&gt;Looking down at my current project, you will notice the obligatory KaTe
&gt;reference - I named the project after listening to a certain album while
&gt;thinking about what to call two hardware boxes which have to talk to
&gt;each other (Cathy and Heathcliffe, obviously).
&gt;
&gt;Nothing to do with a Goodies sketch involving Wuthering Hieghts by
&gt;semaphore at all. :-)

Was this really the Goodies - in my failing memory I always remembered
this as a Monty Python sketch?

P.S. Anyone know when IED is in London?
