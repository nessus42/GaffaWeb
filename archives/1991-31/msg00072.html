        Did we just lose three days? 
        

        *WHEW* Well, I've pretty much typed in every scrap of interview
material that I currently have access to.  Tom from C-Side has promiced to
send me two early and rare interviews and I may be picking up some stuff "new"
stuff, but for now everything I have is in and I am starting the proccess of
adding them into Cloudbusting, Edition 2.  Assuming I don't get any more
interviews, the next Edition will be about 1.6 megabytes long.  Also I will be
making a Wordperfect version available that will be larger, due to the use of
italics, underlining, bold, indexing, and table of contents features.

_Old Grey Whistle Test_ another favorite that combines a beautiful Kate with
dippy interviewers (Chris and I call them the "Twit Twins") and, though Kate
stays at the height of politeness, she manages to get in a few subtle zingers
of her own at these two dorks.



I was originally going to have something like this at the top, but decided
against it: 

        I1: Interviewer (or idiot) 1. 
        I2: Interviewer (or idiot) 2. 

[The interivewers are not identified seperately, but I can't imagine that it
really matters.]

        
        Thanks for the extra "line" in the interview, I have only actually
seen the interview once so I didn't notice her saying this and I didn't want
to have the volume on my tape deck up to high since I blasted my ears on the
1985 Kate Con Jay and Paddy interview.  I'll add the second interview in to my
list of "needed" interviews, as I accidently removed it when I removed the
first one.  The funny thing about these interviews, is that, from what I
understand, these guys are quite popular in England.  

]       I currently am down to "only" 75 interviews left to find(out of a
total of about 300.  Thanks again to IED and Ed for letting me borrow there
interviews.  I'll post the updated list as soon as I am finished updating it. 
The list does NOT include missing RADIO interviews, as there is no
comprehensive radio interview list, that I know of.  So if anyone has any
ultra-rare radio interviews that they have never seen posted, let me know!
