The new issue of _Goldmine_ (Sept. 20) includes *another* letter about
the Kate article that appeared last month.  Here it is:

Kate from Canada (and Elsewhere)
     Thanks for the most interesting article covering the recording career
of Kate Bush.  In addition to those facts and recordings listed in the 
article, the following is a nice complement to the article.
     Canada has been a great source of collectibles when it comes to Kate
Bush.  The first single released in Canada was the same as in the rest of
the world, "Wuthering Heights" on Harvest.  The difference from the other
versions of the song is that this is a 3:33 edit, cutting out a major
part of the ending instrumental.  The next single, "Man With The Child,"
again had a regular issue in Canada.  [It did in the US also.  In fact,
it even got on Billboard's singles chart, peaking in the eighties. -- Ed]
Later it was reissued (from the _Whole Story_ LP) with a unique sleeve.
The song this time was backed with "Sat In Your Lap."
     The two colored vinyl 45s released in Canada as mentioned in the 
article have become highly sought-after items.  The yellow vinyl "Wow"
single came in black title sleeve.  "Symphony In Blue" also had a regular
release in addition to the promo copy mentioned.  It was also in blue
vinyl.  The seven-inch version of the _Live At The Hammersmith_ EP was
housed in a 12-inch cardboard sleeve that the EP fit into.  The EP had a 
fold-open sleeve like the first editions in the U.K.
     The Canadian releases for "Sat In Your Lap" and "Ne T'enfuis" [sic]
were both included with sleeves, the French version sleeve being the same
as the French single release except that the picture on the front was
flipped.  [I don't understand this.  Could this sentence be a typo for
"..., the Canadian version sleeve being the same..."? -- Ed]
     In addition to the above-mentioned differences, Canada is home to
the following:  The 12-inch version of "Hounds Of Love" has for its
B-side the songs from the U.K. version of "Cloudbusting," which never saw
a Canadian release.  _Hounds of Love_, in addition to the pink vinyl
album, also came in a multi-colored cassette.  Both the regular and
colored version of the cassette had the 12-inch of "Hounds of Love" added.
[I may be wrong, but wasn't it the extended version of RUTH?  -- Ed]
The Columbia Record Club version of the cassette is just a straight U.S.
reissue omitting the extra cut.  The final rarity from Canada is the CD
version of the _Sensual World_ album, which as a picture disc with the
picture from the "Sensual World" single imprinted on the disc itself.
     Japan has also had its share of unique picture sleeves for its 45
releases.  "Wuthering Heights" came in a sleeve identical to the Japanese
sleeve for the _Kick Inside_ LP.  "Symphony In Blue" pictures Kate on a 
dolphin.  "Man With The Child" has Kate in a mirror pose in a yellowish
dress.
     Other countries that released unique 45 sleeves not mentioned in the
article were Poland for "Wuthering Heights" (same as the U.S. sleeve for
the second version of the LP) and for "Man With The child," Holland for
different colors on the "Wuthering Heights" single, Belgium for the 
"Man With The Child" single, and Italy with a different sleeve for "Wow."
     Finally, most of the releases of "Wuthering Heights" had a sleeve
unique to the country of origin.  If not a completely different sleeve
from the U.K. version then the back was unique to the country of origin.
This makes each sleeve collectible.
