Hi y'all...

I wanted to send this message personally, but it bounced back faster than
any other message I've ever seen.  I apologize for all the crap at the beginning
and the end of this- but I can't get rid of it, so...

Hi!
 
&gt; I've been reading about the album "The Ninth Wave." I have
&gt; the "Hounds of Love" album and the song list looks like it
&gt; contains two albums: Hounds of Love and The Ninth Wave.  Is
&gt; "The Ninth Wave" a separate album or part of "Hounds of
&gt; Love"?  Were they combined in the US only?
 
I'm replying to you directly, don't be discouraged if people on .gaffa start
groaning and wondering why the hell you asked these questions.  I was a
clueless KaTefan once, and I have sympathy!  :)
 
HoL is really two separate entities, released as one album- everywhere, not
just in the US.  Side 1, "Hounds of Love", has been described by KaTe as a
bunch of fun love songs that you're supposed to listen to and end up feeling
good.  "The Ninth Wave", the b-side of the album, is a concept piece about
someone (a woman) who has been shipwrecked and is in the water, trying to keep
herself from drowning all night until the morning comes.  KaTe wanated to do a
short film based on that piece, but for financial and time reasons had to bag
it.  Unfortunately- it would've been AWESOME.  But I digress.  She released
"HoL", "Running Up That Hill", "The Big Sky", and "Cloudbusting" as singles, of
which "RUTH" became her first (and only, so far- :( ) Top-40 hit in the US.
You'll find a lot of people around here who first heard of her because of that
song... and if you haven't seen the video, DO.  It defies description, as do
most of her videos anyway.
 
&gt; I really like the songs "Running Up That Hill," "Hounds of
&gt; Love," and "The Big Sky."  What other albums can you
&gt; recommend I buy?
 
If I were you, I'd start with "The Whole Story" and go from there.
"CLoudbusting", RUTH, and HoL are on it already, but the others are "greatest
hits" from all her albums (except The Sensual World, which came out in '89).
With TWS in hand, you can find out which of her styles you like, and buy the
album from there.  And get TSW, too- it's her most recent one, and it's as
awesome as all the rest.  The Dreaming might freak you out at first, but, IMHO,
it's her absolute masterpiece, and nothing like anything she or anyone else has
done before or since.
 
Her albums are, in order of appearance:
                The Kick Inside (1978)
                Lionheart (1978)
                Never For Ever (1980)
                The Dreaming (1983)
                Hounds of Love (1985)
                The Whole Story (1986)
                The Sensual World (1989)
 
Her videos:
                The Single File (1983)
                The Hair of the Hound (1985)
                The Whole Story (1986)
                The Sensual World: The Videos (1989)
                Kate Bush Live at Hammersmith Odeon (1980, rereleased 1991)
 
For a complete discography, refer to the .gaffa archives- I think they're at
wiretap.spies.com now, but ask somebody else for confirmation- I've been gone,
and am not sure.
 
&gt; Thanks in advance!
 
You're most certainly welcome- good luck finding more of her stuff, I'm sure
you'll like it.  And welcome to the Love-Hounds pack- hope you enjoy the
experience!!!
 
:)
