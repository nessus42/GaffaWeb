=&gt; Well, I just picked up "The Sensual World" album yesterday. I can see how 
=&gt; it might entail a lot of "controversy." I think it's quite different from 
=&gt; all of her albums (well, the ones I've heard), yet it's still "Kate 
=&gt; Bush." My faves from that one seem to be "The Sensual World," "Between a 
=&gt; Man and a Woman," and "Rocket's Tail." I'm not quite sure if I really 
=&gt; like it quite as much as her older stuff. I hope that she will continue 
=&gt; to write songs like the ones on TSW, yet still keep her style from her 
=&gt; older albums, such as "The Whole Story." I think it's great, the stuff 
=&gt; she did on TSW, but I do hope she still does stuff in her older style.
=&gt; A mix between the two, in my opinion, would be ideal.
=&gt; 

I too found "The Sensual World" to be an album not quite like the
others.  I like the lush orchestration, the Trio Bulgarka, etc.  What
I found weak was...Kate's voice.  It just seemed rather flat, without
the energy and spark of her earlier works.  I don't even like
"Rocket's Tail", preferring "Never Be Mine".  I agree with others
that the sound quality was abysmal, especially for Kate.  Not to say
that it was a bad album, just one that should have been improved.

Actually, when I heard the song "The Sensual World", it was very
promising, and led me to expect an album in that style.  The
disappointment that it really wasn't probably contributed to why I
don't hold the album so highly.

Note to Ed: I have been to Sam's many times and never saw any Kate
videos, but on your recommendation I stopped by again, with the same
results.  When I asked the clerk, he claimed that "The Single File"
and "Live at the Hammersmith" were both "on order".  Right.

				 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I've heard rumours of an "Atlas Shrugged" movie being made.  Anyone
know anything?  Maybe Kate as Dagny?
