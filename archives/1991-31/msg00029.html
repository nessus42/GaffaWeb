<PRE>
  Sunday night in Toronto's Mariposa Folk and Roots Music Festival,
  Jane Siberry was the closing act for the festival.

_____________________________________________________________________

  I saw it last night. She played four songs from her upcoming album.
  I was not impressed, since her style stayed the same, the songs
  were less creative and all relied on her by-now trademark
  soft-to-loud approach. I think she has slipped a bit in
  her quality standard. The audience as usual gave her a
  standing ovation, more out of respect for her past accomplishments
  rather than for what she played that night, IMHO. A good number of
  them never even applauded. I applauded, but never stood up.
  The cast included the guitar player from time eternal (Myer)
  and the piano player from the last tour (Teddy),
  plus a very fat, rather old backup singer who doesn't do a
  good job at all but is a good showman and gets big bear
  hugs from Jane, much undeserved, and also an unknown (to me)
  bass and drums player. The bass and drum players may not be
  a permanent addition to her band.
  No old songs were performed at all.
  The one thing I wouldn't crap about is the musicianship of the
  performers, plus the highly polished sound they managed to create.
  I didn't photograph or recorded anything. There certainly
  was nothing so extraordinary that's worthy of a bootleg.
  The next album is being recorded in Vancouver, and will definitely come
  out some time, and Jane said that regardless of whether the audience
  like the songs that night, the songs will be on the album anyway.
  I think she's getting a bit too self-assured for her own good.
