&gt;That's a scene from the film after Miranda Richardson enters through the mirror
&gt;and wants to make Kate draw the line, the cross and the curve. Lindsay Kemp also
&gt;says something in there which is a) not understandable and b) (IMHO) not very
&gt;relevant (I didn't understand it anyway...). I didn't understand some things,
&gt;especially in the beginning when Miranda is quite hectic in trying to explain
&gt;how she came there.
&gt;
&gt;M: What am I here? I don't[?] want[?] to be here. I don't understand how this has 
&gt;
&gt;   happened.

K: What the hell is going on - who are you?		[correction]

&gt;M: Oh please! You must help me.
&gt;K: What have you done to yourself?
&gt;M: There was an accident, a big fire. I looked[?] over[?] me, my hands are all
&gt;   burned and blistered. There was so much smoke I couldn't believe it. I could, I
&gt;   was trying to find my way out of for years[?]. You must help me! Help me...
&gt;K: How can I help you?
&gt;M: I can't use my hands. I can't use my hands, I have to get back ... back ...
&gt;   home ... There is only one moment left for me to return. And it lies in your
&gt;   hands now.
&gt;K: Don't worry, you'll get home!
&gt;M: You need three pieces of paper.
&gt;K: There's some on the piano. Will this do?
&gt;M: Yes. You draw a line on the first piece.
&gt;K: Like this?
&gt;M: Yes ... A cross ...
&gt;K: Yes.
&gt;M: Good! ... A Curve ...
&gt;K: Here.

M: Thank you. Is there something I can give you in return?.. My shoes perhaps?
	My pretty red shoes?			[correction]
K: [nods and grins] 				[correction]			

M: Take them... Their yours.. As a gift, of course.	[correction]
&gt;

Peter Chow from Brighton (UK) adds:
I've put in a couple of corrections above and during the song Lindsey says

"It's really happening to ya!" and then in the dialogue at the end he says
"She tricked ya y'know?" and then goes into some spiel about singing back
the symbols.

These two lines of his are heavily repeated in the Shoedance mix of the 
single.

In fact the line "She tricked ya y'know?" is the key to Mirranda's behaviour.
All the stuff about the fire and her hands is a deceit to make Kate write
out the symbols that will release Mirranda from the spell that binds the 
shoes to her feet. By writing out the symbols and giving them to the
victim the spell is transferred.
