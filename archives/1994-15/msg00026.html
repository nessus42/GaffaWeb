	Rather late now, so just some quick comments.  (I am a digest reader, 
so I haven't seen today's gaffa traffic.)

	Correction:  in my post outlining the day's events, I had Kate 
appearing at 8:38pm, but that is wrong--that's when TLTC&amp;TC *ended*.  She 
appeared about an hour earlier, 7:38 let's say.

	Fiona asked what a `CDR' is; a `CD recordable'--i.e. a CD made directly 
from tape.  I am not particularly on top of this technology, but apparently 
there are machines that can record directly onto the CD format.

	Evan makes a point that I would underline:  love-hounds/gaffa is a 
genuinely *international* newsgroup, and needs to be perceived as such in 
certain High Places.

	woj added valuable details on several topics in my Convention summary, 
for which many thanks.

	Chris Williams reminded me of the single most glaring omission in that 
summary:  on entrance at the Hippodrome that noon, we were given a number of 
posters and other artifacts that are best transported rolled up into a tube, 
but there were no rubberbands.  I mentioned this to Chris, and with characteric 
vigor he went off, and shortly returned with a bagful of rubberbands!  He was 
our official Rubberband Boy for the afternoon.

	It was my pleasure this afternoon to have Andy Marvick out from 
Manhattan as a visitor in these suburban gardens, and to patch him in to his 
account to read the last few days' lh-digests.  It is sort of disorienting to 
realize that IED is not among us most of the time.  His views on Kate's current 
work are not surprising--I'm thinking of the film in particular.  I am not as 
confident as IED is about its virtues.  I too thought the MoP passage, with 
Kate spinning in space, was unimaginative and boring.  Thing is, we have to 
cherish what we have.  I think that Kate is about to make herself very, very 
scarce, and maybe for a long, long time.

	But--as always--we shall see!
