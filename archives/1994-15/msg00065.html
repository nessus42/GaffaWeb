	I agree that "You Want Alchemy" is a great song.  It's perhaps
the only one of Kate's songs for which I've felt that "This song is about
me" kind of empathy, so I banaged to grasp the hidden depths of this one
much more quickly than I have her other songs.  I assume it was left off
the album due to its slightly subpar production qualities.  
	When TRS was released, there was much speculation and argument
about how much Prince had contributed.  I recall someone who claimed to
have access to ASCAP records that indicated he was credited for co-writing
more than one song.  This guy lost credibility when he claimed to hear
Prince singing and playing guitar and at least four tracks on the album
(so I chalked this up as a Prince fan that assumed any particularly 
creative sound must surely be a Prince contribution, not that of the
pretty girl singer; after all, Prince has a history of doing all the
hard work to give pretty girls singers hit songs.).  Still, there was no
denying a similarity to the Prince "sound" in "Constellation of the 
&gt;heart symbol&lt;" as well as in RBG, to a lesser extent.  It's hard to
believe that Kate would not provide credits where legitimate, though, so
I postulated that this was either a case of indirect influence, or, at
most, a case in which Prince did supply some tracks (a la "Why Should I
Love You") which were ultimately not used on the record.
	So now we have "Alchemy," and again there's some Prince-like
qualities in the concluding portion of the song.  But we have no credits
on this track.  Is this one of the rumored "other Prince collaborations?"
Opinions, anyone?
