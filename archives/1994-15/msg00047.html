Well I hope you enjoy them, it goes without saying that FULL answers are 
required to ensure full marks!! Be careful on question 11 what you think
is the full answer may not be the full answer!

I reckon looking back on it that my team got 14/15 depending on the strictness
of marking, so we were still miles behind the winners even if we did get 14 or
15.

Regarding my earlier comments of the disorgansation of Love-Hounds, the 
loudness of the music made it virtually impossible to communicate,
this didn't happen at the previous convention, hence my comments!

Anyway I would like to thank all the Homeground team and the KBC for a very
good day.
