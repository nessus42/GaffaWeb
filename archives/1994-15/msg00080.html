Hi!

Only 172 messages to go...

Just a short notice: Thanks to everyone who did take part in making that weekend
the most enjoyable weekend in a long, long while! Starting with Geoff Parks,
continuing with Peter Fitzgerald-Morris, Krys, Dave and Lisa, and ending (last
but not least) with all the other people whom I've met. Thanks for everything!
Hope to see you all soon!

Peter Manchester wrote up all the events, and I think I can add some stuff:
&gt;        This was followed by a 40 minute compilation of rare (some not so
&gt; rare) videos:  a lip-synch of HoL with Paddy and the band, at the end of
&gt; which the male accompanist from Kate's video entered and the two of them
&gt; danced as in the video;

BPI Awards

&gt; the "Rocket Man" b&amp;w video; "Delius";

Delius was originally broadcast in the Dr. Hook show where Kate showed the
'alternate' Babooshka video (two sided makeup version), where Kate was
interviewed and didn't say a word, and where the Delius video was introduced
as "The (ever) delicious Kate Bush". The same video later was also included
in the Russel Harty Show where Kate was interviewed together with Julian Lloyd
Webber and Eric (In B!) Fenby.

&gt; what looked
&gt; like an early study for "Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake" for the
&gt; Tour;

That was from the Leo Sayer show.

&gt; a "Hammer Horror" very much like the Hammersmith show, except with Kate
&gt; lip-synching the vocal;

That's from the Australian programme 'Countdown'.

&gt; a fascinating live "Room for the Life" from the
&gt; camera that was following Kate at the Hammersmith show, using what looked
&gt; like the big stage `egg' familiar from "Them Heavy People," except seen from
&gt; the other side, where it was lined with red satin, with Kate reclining in it
&gt; as though in bed;

At first I thought that was the performance that can be seen in the German
"In Concert" documentary, but the ending was different and Chris ensured me
that this really was part of the most rare AND most interesting Kate video
availlable. It's from 'the rest of the best'...

&gt; "Warm Room" from the same camera, Kate at the piano; a
&gt; totally great "Coffee Homeground"; "Symphony in Blue" with Kate at the piano;

Three times a ditto.

&gt; "The Kick Inside" from Die Eftelung video;

It doesn't matter, but before any of our Dutch love-hounds complain about the
ever-ongoing misspelling, it's De Efteling... ;-)

&gt; an unfamiliar "Running Up That
&gt; Hill," lip-synched with the whole band on a metal-framed stage;

That was the Top Of The Pops appearance of RUTH.

&gt; "Reaching
&gt; Out" made into a video with clips from HoL, TD, TBS, L&amp;A, Babooshka, SiG,
&gt; TSW, CB, EtM, WH, Breathing, and TGaT.

Nice work!

&gt;        At 2:30 there came the first break.  This is when Andy and I went
&gt; searching for food, found ourselves stranded on the third level when the
&gt; first boxes of posters and pamphlets from the KBC and HG treasuries were
&gt; being spilled onstage to the groping fans below us.  Andy saw something rare
&gt; spilling out over to the right:  "Oh, that's really rare, that's worth
&gt; something!" he exclaimed in dismay.  "It's not rare any more," I pointed out
&gt; to console him.

Was that the Bill Duffield benefiz concert programme? I thought about the same...

&gt;        Soon intermission was over and live performances resumed with Glen
&gt; Vickers doing RutH on guitar in a sort of a shuffle, and a second song that I
&gt; didn't recognize.  Del Palmer was spotted arriving backstage.  This was

Who did find him? ;-)

&gt; followed with a "by popular demand" playing of the 1979 Christmas special
&gt; (with Peter Gabriel's "Here Comes the Flood" edited out), during which Andy
&gt; caught some well-deserved Zs.

(to Chris, Doug and all other EctoParty goers:) A pity that there wasn't a
trustable VHS vcr around and that the technophiles of the Hippodrome weren't
too confident with too late additions, wasn't it? ;-)

&gt; reported.  While people were organizing themselves into teams, the very
&gt; wicked and entertaining video by Paul Thomas, "The Pink Mules," was
&gt; perpetrated.  This was followed by one of the high points for me, the Mike
&gt; Winter Group dance interpretation of "Ken":  2 men, 4 women, in unisex
&gt; business dress, performing with wit, energy, and precision.

Methinks these two were by far the best things done by fans. Even better
than Paddy Bush's singing. His music is very good, but somehow, well, I
think he should stay a) with instrument(al)s or b) with backing vocals for Kate.

[auction:]
&gt;        Del's Tour program from 1979                      140
&gt; This last was the single most likely of all the items auctioned to acquire a
&gt; collector's item value far beyond its auctioned price.  It was a real gift
&gt; for Del to give it over for the auction, and an even greater generosity for
&gt; him to let it go for the bid that was accepted.

You forgot the most important thing about Del's Tour program: It is signed
by ALL band members.

&gt;        There followed playings of two new KB contributions:  her vocal for
&gt; "Sexual Healing" from the forthcoming Davy Spillane album (sorry, but as this
&gt; was playing I found myself commenting "this is so lame!"); and her
&gt; contribution to the Gershwin album, "The Man I Love," which I found totally
                                                 ^^^^
See one of the questions in the quiz...

&gt;        When the video ended, at about 8:38pm, the riser in the center of the 

&gt; stage lifted Kate Bush herself into our view, and All Rose.  As mentioned, 

&gt; Kate drew one last raffle ticket, spoke of how happy she was to see us all, 

&gt; hoped we would like the film, looked forward to seeing us again.

Peter D F-M: Admit it, no chance, the first ticked that noone claimed was
faked. Half of the time that Kate was on stage was used for the raffle ticked
drawing and handing over the Japanese gold LP for Lionheart to the lucky thief
(thief of a kiss that is). What would Kate have done if the ticket wasn't
invalid in the first try? Maybe she'd have sung a song? ;-)

Bye,

Uli
