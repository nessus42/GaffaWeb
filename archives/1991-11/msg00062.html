Jeff and Ed were:
&gt; [Talking about WHFS.] and so on...

WFNX (boston) has a station-identifiKaTion of the standard "Hello, this
is Kate Bush and you're listening to...".  i'm afraid i haven't been
able to tape it.  i wonder if i could call and request it??!

Ed clarifies:
&gt; We read the USENET news.  The newsgroup rec.music.gaffa contains
&gt; the same thing as the Love-Hounds digest, but postings make it
&gt; to the newsgroup within a few minutes of their being posted,
&gt; usually.  People can respond right away.

recently, "a few minutes" has been several days...  i don't know if
the delay occurs between here and l-hounds central, or on the return
trip;  however, even us .gaffa readers see posts in strange orders.

Jorn quizifies:
&gt; in black boys on mopeds so'c says:
&gt; england's not the mythical land of madme george and roses
&gt; who's madame george?

this was a raging topic on JITR (the Sinead O'Newsgroup) -- there was
no final conclusion. apparently, there is a madame george in a Van
Morrison song -- someone else cited a literary source.  any other
JITRbugs remember more?  the JITR archives are at presto.ig.com, if
you are so inclined...

re the Q magazine "sleevenotes" -- Q arrives irregularly to my newstand --
i never did find the picture of the KTBush Band, and they finally asked
me to stop scanning the issues cover to cover in the store... SO, if you
all across the atlantic would kindly include cover dates when referring
to issues... thanks!

re the _GOoMH_ debate:  (i like that:  goomh!)  maybe i'll have to
finally read a Stephen King book.  i hasten to point out that, regardless
what Ms. Bush syas the inspiration for the song was, it is still an
enlightening and rewarding task to figure out what it means.  it's not
whether you're right or wrong, it's how many interesting KonversaTions
you can have...

hi to Vickie'n'Chris, by whatever route!

footah!
