Well, I was not disappointed that I went to the convention today.
It was quite small, it was reported that attendence was 60 people.
BUT they were all KaTe fans!!! I was told the 1st convention in
Winnipeg only drew 100 people.

Now I want to know where the rest of the Love_Hounds were today
that they were not in attendence? Seriously I wasn't expecting anyone
from a great distance to be there, but one person was in from Minnesota.
Another drove up from Columbus, OH (Hi Richard!).
Hey Ryan what's your excuse for not being there, you flew all the
way to London for the last one and you couldn't drive accross 
town for this one?

The event was sponsored by The American Association of Them Heavy People
(an unofficial KaTe fan club (their statement) for the US) and by
CD Connection of Northeast Ohio. The proprietor (Scott Sheppard)
and his friend Cappy both share the honor of having been to all
the previous KaTe conventions: Winnipeg, London '85 and London '90.
I even spotted my picture in his convention photos. I passed my
collection of photos from the convention for people to see, 
including the group photos of the Love_Hounds. A few of them
have net access and have downloaded all of our postings
and have passed them around. Andrew if I heard Cappy correctly he 
knows you. Cappy brought his collection of KaTe memorabilia for 
everyone to look at. Scott had for sale a huge assortment of 
albums and posters. Throughout the day videos were shown almost continously.
