&gt;Subject: ranting and raving (but not about her KaTeness)

&gt;
&gt;Whoa!!!! I just got done reading Julian Lawton's posting about the Beatles.
&gt;How sorely deluded and misinformed the poor fellow is!  I'm sorry if I'm get-
&gt;ting personal, but an attack on the Beatles, to me, is nothing short of 
&gt;BLASPHEMY.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Any single facet of the Beatles'work has easily been surpassed...
&gt;
&gt;I've read some stupid things in my time, but that comment tops them all.  First,from one point of view, you might say that the achivement of the transistor is 
&gt;not noteworthy to today's world, simply because the IC is orders of magnitude
&gt;beyond it.  So let's dismiss the transistor.  That's ridiculous.  But based on
&gt;the arguement that the sophistication of post-Beatles artists somehow invalidates the contribution of the Beatles is equally ridiculous.
&gt;
&gt;But look at the other side of this.  One could argue that the Beatles music has
&gt;NOT ever been surpassed.  oh sure, new pop heroes come and go, sales records
&gt;continue to be set, but the Beatles are still worshipped by millions a full twenty years after they last recorded.
&gt;
&gt;Another thing, however, is that prior to the Beatles, no one had done what they
&gt;did.  They blazed new ground, they opened all the Doors, they pushed all the 
&gt;barriers.  (Hey i accidently capitalized door-a slip betraying my affection
&gt;for that group!).  Using history as an analogy again, think of what Colombus
&gt;did--he simply sailed across the ocean.   Big deal.  But then, NO ONE else had
&gt;dared to do it.  When you boil it down, the Beatles simply wrote pop music.  So
&gt;what.  The point is, their way of writing had never been attempted before.  It was totally unique.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Do you realize that prior to Sgt. Pepper, no one had ever printed the lyrics to their songs on the album before?  No one had ever put out a concept album prior
&gt;to Pepper?  These may seem like minor points, but no one had ever done them.
&gt;Can any of us conceive of March 1964 when the top five songs in America were
&gt;by the Beatles?  Or 14 of the top 100?  Do you realize that 'She Loves You'
&gt;shipped gold-the first time in history that had happened?
&gt;
&gt;You've got to realize that the Beatles did not just put the music world on it 
&gt;side, they litterally blew it apart and let the pieces fall where they might.
&gt;
&gt;In conclusion, the Beatles far and away transcended pop music.  They were a 
&gt;catalyst to a redefinition of life.  Maybe Jane Austin and Emily Bronte are
&gt;still read today, but don't tell me that their effect on literature was 
&gt;any where near the  Beatles effect on music.   And what was their effect on
&gt;life in the last century?  C'mon, you may not like the Beatles music, and you
&gt;are certainly entitled to your opinion, but don't delude yourself into thinking
&gt;the world is not how it seems because YOU don't understand it from your 
&gt;vantage point.

This view is often expressed by Beatles fans.  I've even heard Beatles fans
say that they "invented" Rock 'n' Roll.

But . . .

1. Bill Haley &amp; The Comets invented Rock 'n' Roll

2. Elvis Presley was the first superstar of Rock 'n' Roll

So you might consider The Beatles as a follow-on to Elvis, The King.
