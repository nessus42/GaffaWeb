    I have a record by Vangelis which I bought over 4 years ago. I can not 
    figure out it's name. It is a light brown color. Every written word on 
    it are in Greek. The music is just fantastic. There is an opera singer 
    who sings on almost all of it's tracks. I like to know what it is 
    called.

    Also couple of days ago I found out that my record is broken and the 
    first song is impossible to play but the rest are OK. I like to 
    replace it. Does any one know if this album is available on CD and how 
    I might be able to get a copy of the record or the CD.

    I remember before Vangelis went solo he was playing in a group 
    called   " Afrodite's Child " (sp?). I think their first album was " 
    666 ". Vangelis was playing the keyboards and Demis Roussos (sp?) was 
    vocals and guitar and there was another guy on drums. 

    I like to know what is happening to Demis Roussos these days. Last I 
    heard of him was in 1987 he had a concert somewhere and produced a 
    tape of that concert ( Which I have )( I have about 82 of his solo 
    songs and some with Vangelis from Afrodit's Child days ) Does any one 
    have A. D. or Demis's discography?

    Any response will be appriciated.
