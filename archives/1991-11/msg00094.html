&gt;
&gt;Also, can someone answer the following questions: (excuse
&gt;my ignorance...)
&gt;
&gt; 1) How old is she ? And how old was she when she recorded her first
&gt;    album? 

Born on July 30, 1958, making her 32. She recorded TKI in '77, so she was 19.
Two songs - The Man with the Child in His Eyes and Saxaphone Song were
recorded in '75 though. (correct me if I'm wrong)


&gt; 2) Is she married, (the guy that took here photo for the cover of
&gt;    _The Whole Story_ is that her husband?) [I have a poster
&gt;    of that cover!]

Not that I know of...John Carder Bush is her brother and photographer.


&gt; 3) Roughly where does she live (yes, I know the address is classified B-)))

Hmm...somewhere in England i would guess.


&gt; 5) What DIGESTS can I join to talk to other KB freaks and to obtain
&gt;    more info on her.

This is it. I think all (or most) KB fans frequent this newsgroup/digest.


&gt; 7) Will she ever do a world tour ?? (I pray she will!!!!)

She said she is making plans...but I wouldn't hold my breath.

gotta run (I think my answers are correct -  or very close...)
