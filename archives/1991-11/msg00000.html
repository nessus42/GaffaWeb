Kate has said that _Get Out Of My House_ was inspired by _The Shining_,
the book specifically.

In Doug's interview she says...

| And it's very much a play on a traditional song called "The
| Two Magicians" about someone who's trying to escape someone,
| and they keep changing their form in order to escape them.
| But the other thing keeps changing its form.  And that's
| actually what the whole song is about -- someone who is running 
| away from something they don't want to face, but wherever they 
| go, the thing will follow them.  Basically, you can't run away 
| from things -- you've got to confront things.  And it's using 
| the person as the imagery of a house, where they won't let 
| anyone in, they lock all the doors and windows, and put a guard 
| on the front door.  But I think the essence of the song is about 
| someone trying to run away from things they don't like and not 
| being able to escape -- because you can't.
 
It seems to me that _exactly_ what is being run from isn't really
important, or at least Kate doesn't say that it is.  

I tend to wonder about the inclusion of this and another song pondering 
the idea of locking things or keeping them open on _The Dreaming_ 
considering the way Kate's dealings with the public have changed over 
the years.  But then, that gets falls into the "this must be auto-
biographical" trap that awaits at our every turn.
