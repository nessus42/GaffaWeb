SST style,

LoveDolls/LoveDoll Superstars/et al.  at dc space.

This was suppossed to be a showing of the new LoveDolls movie 'LoveDoll
Superstars" which star those female stars, the LoveDolls.  You
can check out this vid and their first (Desperate Teenage Lovedolls) 
thru SST.  Sat thru a bunch of SST videos first though, including 
a bad Black Flag videos (Slip it in), an old one (tv party), and a good
one (Drinking and Driving).  The last one is hot as hell - suprised
that MTV actually plays that.  Slip it in shows Greg "Page" Ginn showing
his guitar work.  and all of them show their friends in the video (ala
vanity videos).  from the huskers we saw the lame ones (Makes No Sense
and Love is all Around us).  Videos from Angst, Painted Willie, and the
Meat Puppets were okay, nothing spectacular.  The best ones were the
minutemen by far.  "Ain't talking about love" at 35 seconds, also "This
ain't no picnic" and "King of the Hill" show these dudes at there best.
Also for our 'enjoyment' (and i use the term loosely), we got to see a
Mentors video which had something to do about tieing up naked women and
beating them, and grossness galore.  then there was a short film clip
with these masters of slime where they were on a talk show were they
extolling the virtues of 'rape rock' and why RR is okay. 

if you are really desperate for LoveDoll Superstars, buy it. otherwise,
wait for a friend to.  It's okay, nothing spectacular.  parts are funny
and parts are really boring.  gets moronic after a while. 

The LoveDolls themselves are okay as a band.  probably give our
moderator a hard-on, but otherwise eh.  did mostly covers, like "Rock n
Roll Hootchie Coo" and "Rock n Roll" and some other stuff.  but i
got bored and left. 

Henry "Wank" Rollins is tonite - probably a pass on this one as well.
