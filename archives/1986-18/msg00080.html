Ho-dee-do, finally read the last two weeks or so of stuff.  Good thing the
term's almost over.

ESSENTIAL LISTENING STUFF:
and it's American!
and it's raw hard and lewd enuf for Wic and Hof!

MOJO NIXON
(and Skid Roper)

These dudes played a free noon concert here at Tech, and having heard all
about them from some friends, I checked it out.  Then went and dug up an
album.  As one of my friends said, "Seriously outta hand".

They got Mojo with his beat-up electric guitar, amp and no effects.  They
got Skid with his upright washboard, which he uses to great effect.  They
even got an empty bottled-water bottle that whips out a mean Bo Diddley
beat on "Mushroom Maniac".

And Mojo sings songs like "I'm A'Moanin' With Yo Mama", "Gonna Put My
Face On A Nuclear Bomb", "Jesus At McDonalds" ... this is music as roots
as it gets, a mean fusion of hilbilly stomp with lowdown blues, with a
front-man so outta hand he's Possessed By The Devil.  Great Googly
Moogly!  Mojo rants, raves and shouts.  He's lewd, rude, AND crude.

Honest music.  About fucking.  And burning down a mall because Jesus
told you to.  And crawling through a cow pasture at 4am sniffing through
cow turds looking for yer psychedelic delight.  And fucking.  And
stomping on art fags.  And going to heaven and discovering the entire
Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker record collections stretched out ahead
of you.  Did I mention fucking?

And "Jesus at McDonalds" continually teeters on the edge of "Roadrunner",
and live he even throws in some choruses of "with the radio on" ... what
more do you need to know?  Buy it!  It is but an exceedingly pale shadow
of the live experience ... which is to say it but shreds.  Good for
wiping the synthesizer taste outta yer mouth (which even I must do, so I'm
playing that Hunters &amp; Collectors, early Killing Joke, the Beatles ...
even gonna borrow some Metallica from a local metalhead to see what the
shouting's about.)

Anyhow go buy that Mojo Nixon (available thru Enigma) and PLAY THAT SUCKA
LOUD ENOUGH FOR YOUR PARENTS TO HEAR AND GET THE FEAR OF *G*O*D* !!

"Jesus said to me,
'Mojo, I want you to go downtown
and burn down that mall.'
And I said, 'right away, Jesus'."

(PS: And how could I forget "Stuffin' Martha's Muffin", about our fave VJ,
Martha Quinn?)
