bit to find it, and it may not be so cheap.

Very Rare Stuff
---------------

"Another Day" -- Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel do a duet version of Roy
	Harper's wonderful song "Another Day".  This is from Kate's BBC
	Xmas special that was broadcast in 1979 and is not on any record
	(except bootleg).  "Another Day" has also recently been covered
	exceedingly well by This Mortal Coil on their album "It'll End
	In Tears".

"Egypt" -- A live version of the song from Kate Bush's 1979 concert
	tour.  This is *totally* different from the version on "Never
	for Ever".  Not on any record (except bootleg).

"Let It Be" -- Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, and Steve Harley covered this
	during one of Kate's concerts in 1979.  Available officially
	only on a rare Japaneese flexidisk.

A song in a movie called "The Magician of Lublin" -- Kate sings a song
	written by Maurice Jarre.  It is used as background music in the
	film, and I haven't yet found it in any other form.

To Be Released Stuff
--------------------

"Brazil" -- Kate sings the theme song to the film *Brazil*.  The
	soundtrack is not yet released.

Kate has recorded a song for the film *Castaways*.

Kate has performed vocals for Go West's (ick!) upcoming album.


Exceedingling Rare
------------------

I'd commit mass murder to get any of these.  PLEASE tell me if you ever
find them anywhere!

*Kate Bush, The Early Years* -- An East German pressing of some of
	Kate's early  demo tapes.  Kate took legal action before the
	records got out of the warehouse.

"Maybe" -- In 1975 David Gilmour produced a demo tape for Kate Bush to
	give to EMI to help her get her recording contract.  Two of the
	three songs on that demo tape were taken directly from that tape
	and put on "The Kick Inside":  "Saxaphone Song" and "The Man
	With The Child In His Eyes".  The third song "Maybe" was never
	released, but I have about 20 seconds of it from a radio show
	where Kate was interviewed and they played a little bit of it.

Kate did an Xmas jingle and gave it to radio stations to play, but
	she says that she is not aware of any station having ever played
	it.

It is said that before Kate met David Gilmour she made a very rough demo
	tape at home containing 50 songs!  She sent this off to record
	companies, but it didn't produce any response.  I guess it
	doesn't hurt to have David Gilmour on your side....

All of the tons of demos, experiments, alternate versions, unreleased
	songs, and other stuff that is lying around in Kate's closets
	that we will never get to hear!

P.S.  Don't say I didn't ever do anything for you.
