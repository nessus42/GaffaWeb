Since the last posting IED has remembered five more KT non-LP
tracks to add to the list above.

"The Magician" (theme song from the film "The Magician of Lublin",
        music by Maurice Jarre, lyrics by ?; soundtrack never
        released);
"Do Bears Shalala...in the Woods?" (duet with Rowan Atkinson from
        the British Comic Relief concerts, from "Utterly Utterly Live");
"Don't Give Up" (duet with Peter Gabriel, from "So");
"Sat In Your Lap" (rhythm tracks only, from "Feeling Fit, Looking Fit",
        British television program);
Theme from "The Castaways", forthcoming movie soundtrack.

Yeah, what DOES IED stand for?

"The Single File", in addition to being the title of Kate's
video compilation, is also the title of a collection of her
UK singles in a boxed set.  It included 13 singles in picture
sleeves (more or less identical to the original UK sleeves, but
on thinner pape; there are various other minute differences from
the originals, most significant of which is that, where applicable,
the mixes on the re-releases are the LP mixes, not the original single
mixes). The Single File boxed set is also pictured on the inside
cover of The Whole Story. It has a greenish picture of the ivy from
the back cover of The Dreaming on it.

There are many Kate Bush fanzines now, only one of which is
"official", meaning only it includes messages, articles, comic strips,
stories, etc. by Kate herself. This one is the Kate Bush Club Newsletter:
P.O. Box 120, Welling, Kent DA16 3DS, England. It is slow to appear, and
always too brief, but it is now extremely well produced and usually has
something of importance to add to the Kanon. IED's favorite part is
always the adventures of Zoodle and Pyewacket.

Then there is the now SEMI-official "Homeground," which is
probably the oldest of the fanzines. Run by Peter Fitzgerald-Morris
and Dave Cross, its address is:
55 Whippendell Way, Orpington, Kent BR5 3BZ, England.

Next, there is the still very formidable Break-Through, formerly
the work of Dale Somerville, now mainly edited by his wife Robyn
Carstairs. Its address is:
P.O. Box 160, Hartney, Manitoba, ROM OXO Canada.

There is an Australian fanzine called "Dreamtime", at:
46 Gladstone Avenue, South Perth 6151, Western Australia.

The Scottish fanzine is "Blow-Away", edited by Jackie Bain, at:
117 Leeward Circle, Westwood, East Kilbride, G75 8NZ, Scotland.

And there is also now an upstart "glossy" (ha, ha) fanzine from
England called "Under the Ivy", actually quite inoffensive. Its
address is:
55 Burnside Road, Dagenham, Essex RM8 1XH, England.

There is apparently a Japanese branch of the official Kate
Bush Club, presumably with its own newsletter, since Kate and
her brother John went to the trouble of sending them a hello
message last year. IED does not have their address.

There is also a new French (?) fanzine dedicated to both
Kate and Peter Gabriel. Maybe Doug remembers their address.

And there is at least one defunct fanzine, a Seattle publication
three issues long by Gillian Garr, called "For the Love of Kate".

And of course there is our own beloved Love-Hounds Digest.

That's all that IED knows about. Any further inquiries will only
produce greater confusion at this end.
