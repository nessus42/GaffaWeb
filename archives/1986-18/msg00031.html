	"Here, Derrick, take my coat," said Babs. "Make yourself look
like a street person, ferchrissakes!"
	Big Al and The Ice Girl were off trying to find an open office
supply store to buy a green marker to fake the smudge for in-out privs,
while we stood outside the door to DV8, waiting for the idiot in the
white coat to tell us we could buy the few remaining will-call tix to the
sold out Shreikback show last night. "What?! $15?! Yeah, well you can take
your ..." I was suddenly interrupted by Babs, pushing me aside saying
"Yes, we'll take three ..."
	Halfway through the opening band's set (later I would confront the
front man and learn the band was called `Nova Mob' ... "... what?
`Nobel Mod'" I asked? "No, man ... can't you *hear*?" -- I lunged at
him, screaming "Yeah, I'll take your puny little Casio and ..." but
Babs dragged me downstairs to the meat market before I could get my
hands on him ... sheesh ... a bunch of jokers with expesive
synthotoys), they announced "This is our last time with this
configuration ... we got a real drummer!" and no one reacted.  They
blasted their way into a late `60's medley ... Inagoddadavidda, baby.
	A monkey whirls around and smacks into Babs, spilling her drink.
Lucky it wasn't that full, or I would have had to break his arm. He gets
off easy *this* time, but ... why_i_oughta ... but soft! The bald man
appears! Backup singers like some '78 Roxy Muzak ... short white halter
tops and leather skirts in synchro_egypto_danse_o_mania.
	Very slick sound. Basically what I expected from them. Very
together jams. Tight. But rhythmic like you never felt. Bozo in front
of me: such a wimp, trying to stand on his toes to "sneek" a picture of
the band ... "If he were a man, he'd walk up to the stage," Babs
mumbles. I reach for a beer bottle to crush his puny brains, but Babs
spots an opening near the front ... (I can't *believe* this place has
the audacity to have 5, yes FIVE fucking Keith Harring paintings. Cover
one whole wall, they do. Babs mentions there is a "VIP cluster room"
for the elite to party in @ $50/head ... even Congo Bill's wasn't like
that ...).
	A simply beautiful rendition of _falling flowers_ was the
hi-light for me. Mostly stuff from the new album and Oil_n_Gold.
Check 'em out if you can.
	Afterwards, heard a new mix of heartbreak_beat by the p_furs
(anyone have tour info for them?) and to my utmost surprise, a
version of collapsing_new_people by fad_gadget. Haven't heard them
since they were here 3 years ago or so. Made me miss the old days.
(when they were in SF last, they spent the afternoon before the gig
walking around picking up trash ... arriving with it all on stage,
they announced that "This is your city ... listen to it!").
	Big Al, tired from his drive north earlier in the day,
made the drive back in record time, as sleep came down.
