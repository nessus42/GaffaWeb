This must be the special Adrian Belew orgy weekend here or something.
Belew did two shows with the Bears (I didn't go because it was $10
and I didn't want to hear Belew play pretty pop music), and
Home of the Brave came to the area for the first time (yeah, this
is the Midwest, we're behind in everything but underground rock
shows and supercomputers :-)) for 8 screenings (run by a campus film
organization.) Belew looks kind of, um, silly in the movie, but
I liked van Tiegheim. Some stuff came off better in the movie
than when I saw LA live a few months ago, but the version of
Gravity's Angel was wimpy. Imagine those howling industrial noises
amplified 100 times and you'll come a little closer to the live
version. None of this wimpy piano shit. The audience ate up all
the old tricks, and gasped when Belew played his guitar with knife
and fork. Go buy some Sonic Youth, guys.

Seen in the local campus rag: "(Belew and) The Bears opened the set
with a particularly sonic version of Jimi Hendrix's classic Purple
Haze." Ummm... isn't a "sonic song" kind of like a "picturesque
picture"? :-)

Greg Earle, where can I get some Boise industrial music? I want to
mail a copy to a, um, conservative friend of mine from Boise...

And now, what you've all been waiting for...

NEW KATE BUSH RELEASE ANNOUCED!!!!

Gnu Alliance Records in Terre Haute, Indiana has announced a 7" EP
of Kate Bush covers, with the consent of Kate herself! Apparently,
Kate was somewhat jealous after Sonic Youth, Mike Watt and Martin
Bisi released their Madonna covers, and has given the nod to this
ambitious project.

Negotiations are still pending, but the planned record will
contain several versions of Kate's latest single "Experiment IV"
and her first hit, "Wuthering Heights". Side A will probably employ
the talents of an industrial/noise supergroup formed for the
occasion, featuring Genesis P-Orridge on bass, Boyd Rice on guitar
(with electric fan, of course,) Diana Rogerson on vocals, Monte
Cazzaza on synthesizers, and Z'ev on percussion. Chris Watson,
long lost member of Cabaret Voltaire, will come out of retirement
to provide tapes and electronics with the help of Paul Lemos.
Diana Rogerson has promised Kate that "the vocals will be done
RIGHT this time."

Side B will contain the Lustdogs' version of "Wuthering Heights".
Lustdogs are another one-shot supergroup, formed entirely from
various members of the electronic fanzine lovehounds. The introductory
rap features Jim Hofmann on vocals, with John Hogge on drums
and Tim Wicinski providing funky synth lines. The main sections
of WH will add vocals, extra lyrics and acoustic guitar by Doug Alan,
synthesized gamelan by Greg Taylor, keyboards and guitar by John Rossi,
prepared piano by Bill Hsu, and turntables by Greg Earle. 
Preliminary takes sound pretty impressive, with twin drummers Hogge 
and Labovitz thundering in the studio. Doug Alan has promised Kate
that "the vocals will be done RIGHT this time."

While negotiations are still pending, Gnu Alliance is optimistic
that the record will be released by March of '87. A tour is also
planned, and it is hoped that both groups of musicians will take
part in the mega industrial/noise/hardcore/post-punq festival held
in seven major international cities, with worldwide TV broadcasts
and appearances by groups such as Nurse with Wound, Smegma, Bourbonese
Qualk, Executive Slacks, Sonic Youth, Butthole Surfers, Beefeater
and the Ex. A special Throbbing Gristle reunion is planned.
Proceeds will go to the National Endowment for Subversive Musics
and Activities, which finances such worthy projects as Existential
Aid and Survival Research Laboratories.

Stay tuned for further details.

Bill Hsu
