Re: Roger Miller 1972

Roger Miller is THAT old??? He didn't look more than a year or three above
our age (ummm... read mid '20s) when I saw him here. Hey, maybe making
great music will keep you looking like a kid! Somebody should tell Michael
Jackson that... 

Re: Windpuke Hill

I confess, shamefully: I do own ONE Windpuke Hill record. I bought it when
I was young and impressionable, and don't listen to it anymore. It's also
thousands of miles away at home. Am I forgiven yet?
I think you guys misinterpreted John Rossi's "the real thing" remark. I
thought he was referring to this: this New Age mush HAS ALL BEEN DONE
BEFORE, and probably in a more inventive manner. Most of what's marketed
as New Age these days are just watered-down versions of what Eno,
Tangerine Dream etc. were doing in the '70s. What most people (me included)
find repulsive about New Age mush is not that it's musically empty,
but that it's like a new version of the Monkees, old ideas dressed up
in new, blatantly commercial marketing clothes. 

I have nothing against building something on old ideas, but you should
at least warp the ideas almost beyond recognition or recreate them so well
that it's frightening. That's what the most interesting neo-psychedelic
bands do.

Re: this library that I mumble about

This is the Champaign public library, and they have a respectable collection
of alternative music recordings because people who work at this superb
record store in town happen to donate stuff there once in awhile. It's
worthwhile digging thru stacks of Fill Colon records (while trying not
to puke) to pick out things like Bourbonese Qualk, Diana Rogerson, 1919,
Smegma, etc.

Uhhh... John Rossi, I still don't have your real world address!

What happened to Richard from Australia who was putting together an
industrial/post-punk compilation?

Re: More zines and music

Ono is a noise group from Chicago with a superb male vocalist who does
demented negro spiritual type things backed by horendous guitar noise.
Check out their latest Ennui, which I keep forgetting to rave about...

Do any of you Japanese hardcore gurus know anything about "Rose Rose"(sp.?)??
They did this great song on Max Rock &amp; Roll which moves thru grungy
post-punk, speed metal, and hardcore in all but 2-3 minutes.

Black Market Comics --- I got this for the comics, but they weren't that
good. Mainly speed metal zine with reviewers who like death rock also. You
get a lot for $1, but I wasn't really into what they offered... (The Luna
Ticks strips were ok tho)

Washington DC Period --- Thick newsprint zine full of reviews and interviews.
The best comix of any zine I've seen. Good detailed show reviews, with
many different types of music showcased (the one I had talked about 
Beefeater, Marginal Man, Peach of Immortality, Meat Men, Robyn Hitchcock etc.)

Shredded Slime --- 10 or so 8.5 by 11 xeroxed pages with lots of reviews,
interviews, comics and collages. I really liked the latest, with a
Happy Flowers interview and one with Chadbourne. 

(Several lovehounders are involved with the last two zines; I'll let them
identify themselves if they want.)

Some local stuff:

Raunch-o-rama --- A loosely formatted "information sheet" put out 
irregularly. Mostly record and comix reviews; recent ones featured such
obscure abrasive artists as Gargoyle Mechanique, Steve Fisk, Amor Fati,
Record reviews are always long and detailed. Occasional contributions
by the Pizz, John E., and other underground comix people. Also runs a
mail art "contest".

Phosphorus Flourish --- The emphasis here is on photo-xerox collages,
with some political and literary stuff. On the whole a little uneven,
but a lot of really beautifully textured collages. 

Better than Nothing --- Rather innocuous zine that's almost semipro
(some local ads.) Does make some attempt at covering the local scene,
but too commercially minded and ill-informed to be useful. Its idea of
a cool local scene is to have whatzisface from Spin come down once
a month to check out the local bands. Of course the title is also
pretty insulting to the other local zines, which have been around 
much longer.

If you're interested in these zines, drop me a line and I'll dig up the
addresses.

(Fidelis, I mailed you a note, so if you don't get it soon please holler
again...)
