&gt;&gt; RE: WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO..

	...on the edge of my vertigo , I've been rotting in my juice
	down here in the sewers where all that moves is drenched with hunger
	for noize ... news travels slowly through this slime ...

"RED JENNY / BORENGAJULI"
-------------------------
		This tape I'm doing is a conglomeration of 
material I've been working on with the bass guitarist
from a Melbourne band called "Skippy the Butcher". Vocals for the 
tape are being finalised now with the ex vocalist from another ex- Melbourne
/Sydney(?) band called Cough-Cough. This stuff is heavily into noise &amp; sounds.

----------------------------------------

	I will however be on the lookout for new independent release
sounds around the place - and might yet try to put a compilation tape
together as well.

	"Skippy the Butcher" are putting a tape together shortly.
DON'T send money 'till I say go!
(Same for the "Red Jenny" tape)
	
&gt;&gt;&gt; " Severed Heads ".. (?).. (yawn..)

	Some real sounds that have been happening out here :
Skippy the Butcher, Willsmere, Snails, the Slub, This is Serious Mum,
Shower Scene from Psycho, Venom P. Stinger. Shower Scene (maniacal synth/beat
cover band.. but their covers are VERY different to the originals..)
have a mini-albumn out.  (not as good as live performances I've seen
.. but still o.k.). 
This is Serious Mum ('death-pop/satire'.. about the most hyped thing since
sliced cricket-jerks-balls ) have a single out (defacate on my face)
The first time I saw T.i.S.M. the show opened with just one guy wearing
a black balaclava and operating a short-wave radio.. the rest of the 
band came stepping through the crowd from the back of the place 
all dressed in black and wearing bright green pumpkin heads
and screaming out an obscene question/answer session. Upon reaching the stage
all of them started suspiciously searching the crowd for Nazi-punks
and T.S.Elliot gummers.. seconds later to burst into DEATH/DEATH/DEATH/
AMWAY/AMWAY/AMWAY !
	"The Slub" played the Duke of Edinburough last Wednesday.. 
Some great vocals by John Murphy (has worked with Nurse with wound,
Current .93. , Einsturzende Neubauten..) and also by the girl they've
got now. Both of them howling and screaming over what to me sounded like
noized up soft post-punk/rock&amp;roll.. drums/guitar/bass/harmonica(!).
The girl reminded me a lot of DIAMANDA GALA's stuff, but without the 
wet sounding 'out-of-control' noises.. really good.
	"Snails" played the same night - I liked these guys a lot
better than a few months ago. Thrash with a cycadelik Residents/Der Plan-like
stage presentation. The guitarist/noisist was wrapped in silver, with a
silber elephant trunk like thing over his head and dangling around the stage.
( Last time I saw them he was wearing a T.V. set on his head! )

	Anyway... It's friday.. and it's getting hard to stay awake..
T.I.S.M. tonight ( backing Big Pig .. interesting line up: 2 drummers,
1 percussionist, 1 harmonica(again?), 1 keyboard, ~3 or 4 vocalists...
big on blues like sounds ) Tonnes of new/old records... reviews coming soon...
( I think )..

P.S. Kraftwerk's "Electric cafe" seems to be pretty disappointing..
would have expected a bit more of a new sound after all these years.

P.P.S. to b.hsu : staying tuned for more on the KT/industrial noixe
		"zupergroupe" combination ( wot?! )
