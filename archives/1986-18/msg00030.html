<PRE>
The new Break-Through is out, and includes
the UNEDITED post-Hounds of Love interview
by Peter Swales for Musician magazine, the
interview with Kate, Del and Paddy together,
in what IED considers to be BY FAR the best
interview ever done. Swales asks absolutely
wonderful questions, understands many (though
not all) of the fine points of Kate's music
and thoroughly understands the general importance
of it. Furthermore, as a close and longtime
personal friend of the Bush family, he has brought
to the interview situation an informality and
relaxed atmosphere that has produced long and extremely
frank comments from all parties involved. It is
INDISPENSIBLE reading.

Also something of a relief: the Christian shit
has been confined mainly to the first page editorial,
perhaps partly in reaction to IED's and Mike Weaver's
polite but strong suggestions that this be done.
Overall, in IED's opinion, this edition of Break-Through
stands as the best single Kate Bush fanzine issue published
to date. Of course there's alot of scumwad schlock in it,
but in all fairness to Robyn, she has published an awful
lot of thoughtful and edifying KT-related stuff in the
past three issues, and is to be thanked sincerely for her
policy of printing nearly everything sent to her without
editing or abridgement. This is in marked contrast to Homeground,
and obviously it is a service completely unavailable from the
official Oracle of KT, the Kate Bush Newsletter.

Finally received the first three issues of the Scottish
KT zine, Blow Away. Not at all bad, though of course extremely
low budget. Several very informative pieces included.

Regarding Eric Cotton's request for a Kate Bush discography:
a full discography of all the various countries' pressings
of Kate Bush's recordings is really impracticable at
this point. There are highly coveted Brazilian EPs,
some fine Dutch variants, the Japanese singles, a bunch
of interesting Spanish, Italian and even Greek, Portuguese
and New Zealandish pressings. Therefore, the best you could
hope to do would be to write a KT fan in every country you
could think of, asking him/her for a discography of the given
nation's releases.

If you're only looking for an official UK discography, just
look in the inside cover of Kate's new greatest hits package,
The Whole Story (in US stores as you read this).
All of the official UK releases to date are listed and
illustrated therein. However, by no means does this imply that
all of her recorded performances are covered by the Whole Story's
discography. As Doug will proudly confirm, we will soon have
yet another KT session recording, this time by his favorite band,
Go West.

About the KT items described by Eric as recent trade acquisitions:
Are you quite sure that it says "NEW YORK" Palladium?
IED would be willing to wager some rare KT items that
the bootleg in question is a recording of the LONDON
Palladium concert, well known to KT bootleggers already.
Also, IED believes you are referring to three-quarter inch
(industry format) video. The official video compilation
is still not scheduled for NTSC USA release, so you are
fortunate.
