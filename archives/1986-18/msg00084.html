1. the MEATMEN have a new album out - Rock N' Roll Juggernaut (Caroline)
but it's not as bad as I was expecting. Has the usual comedy bits in
between songs and a running commentary by Tesco throughout.  (Is this
a dig at the self-referntial criticism from Trouser Press?).  Some songs
even hearken back to the excellent, "and you suck" 7"'s from way back
and other involves alot of work from Lyle Preslar but strangely enough
Lyle lets studio musicians sit in on some of his guitar parts which
kinda undermines their boasts and claims of being so great and all.  There
is one song that is actually serious about the Roman Empire and comparisons
between them and us:  in fact this is the closest the Meatmen have
come to copping where they're coming from.  Amazing...  look for the
promo flexi - like the one for War of The Superbikes, this is a funny.
I thought I'd be disappointed with the commercial heavy metal cuts, but
they're evenly spaced between the type of Meatsongs I like.


2.  that LIVE SKULL EP (Pusherman) doesn't really impress me as much as
the Cloud One LP but like all Live Skull takes a coupla listens and approaches
to understand where they're coming from and whether you'll be coming back
to the record for more pain (like I do with Cloud One but don't with their
first EP).o

3.  KILLDOZER - repeat after me, KILLDOZER is cool and will be trendy.  Beat
the trend and get the Burl EP - it rips in the fully horny, sleazy glory
of the raunchiest Stones and the T. Rex you can find anywhere.  I think they've
found their niche as evidenced in Snakeboy and the two recents cuts on the
God's Dog compilation.  Get Get Get.

4.  BIG BLACK has rereleased the first two EP's - Lungs and Bulldozer on
on Homestead (perhaps their last b4 they jump over to Touch And Go) and
if you missed them the first time, you now have no excuse.  Suprisingly,
Lungs sounds weak compared to all the raves I've heard - no wonder as it
was recorded on a four track.  However, Bulldozer is definitely worth
getting this - the reference points leading up to the incredible Atomizer
(so far, my pick for best of the year) are all there - in fact so much so
that Atomizer sounds like a beefed up remake.  Funny though, that compared
to Racer X, it's hard to imagine that Racer X came in between these two
records.  Hmmm...

There's some trendy bands you can sit on and rotate...
