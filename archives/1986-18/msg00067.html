hey dudes, isn't the first line in "Crazy Dan" kinda like 

"There was this guy, and he took his wife,and he took some kerosene,
and then he set the bitch on fire. you see crazy dan..."

something like that.

shelli, a little late for being suicidal aren't we ? that was trendy
last year. this year it's doggy style ("how do you want to do it ?") and
next year who know what those suburban californian kids have in store.

but what do you expect from someone who spells their name with an 'i' at
the end....

and sue, if you don't like the rag in your mouth, where DO you want it ??

(cant take credit for that awesome line, that wittle jimmie hoffie for
that).

doug, bruce is so blue-collar american (or used to be) it's not funny.
There have been times where I would gather some working class
Beltsvillians together and play some kate for them, and they would not
hate it, they just would not buy it. One claims it sounds like something
you'd see on PBS.  another said "When I get off of third shift working
in the press room (ala printing presses) i don't want to hear this, I
want to listen to Sitcky Fingers or something like that. many people
don't CARE where the origin of the chorus of hello earth came from (like
they don't have the time) but they do want to listen to something
reasonable when they're hanging out at the bar shooting pool. I guess
when you sit in a fern bar sipping non alcholic drinks and eating quiche
you might hAVe the time to think about the chorus of hello earth and
it's origins. 

and don't knock shit like working third shift unless you've done it (and
not working on a program in front of some nerdminal either).  see ms.
hofmann about the joy of thrid shift (I've only done second shift work
in a wharehouse so i can't say either). 

deer season in maryland this week. picked up a hitchhiker who described
his kill in gruesome details.  I'll tell all you vegetarians all about
it in drawn out explanations....
