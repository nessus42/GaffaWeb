Review of Billy Bragg's concert at the Ritz in NYC:

In 3 words: Don't miss it!

This was a phenomenal show.  BB is a terrific performer: witty,
politically/socially  conscious, etc. He never missed an 
opportunity to crack a joke, which had the people I was with
laughing heartily. (E.G. "Those downstairs clap their hands for
applause, those upstairs rattle their coke spoons"... Remember
that Lennon reference??) He also never missed a chance to
hit hard on the governments of the U.S. and U.K. and to talk
about, yes, PEACE.
  The music was just he and his guitar, which  therefore sounded
more like his early albums than the most recent. But the songs
from the latest album were done really well, especially
"Greetings to the New  Brunette", despite the absence of Johnny Marr.
In fact, the crowd seemed to prefer it this way. He did most of his old
"hits" (A New England, Between the Wars)  and some surprises.
   I know personally at least 5 people that are now BB "converts"
after this show and there are probably lots more. Definitely go
see him!

P.S. Did anyone see the Philip Glass shows at Lincoln Center?
     (Is anyone else from the New York area on the net???)
