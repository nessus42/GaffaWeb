Paul Kirsch asked about things happening (musically) in the D.C.
Area during 12/19-22 but since I couldn't get through to him, I'll bore you guys
with the lineup (plus it should give you an idea of the alternative
rock scene in this city).

*** 9:30 Club ***
at the 9:30 - not much, 19-20th - the slickee boys with
beatnik flies on the 19th and tuff luck on the 20th.

The Slickeez are okay, i don't know why sue t. doesn't
like them as they specialize in wimp guitar pop 
to some degree - i guess they don't smell like ivory soap
or something - still not anything but pure entertainment yet still
rock n' roll w/ punk roots.

I hear the Beatnik Flies blew the fatass Siouxsie off the stage the
last time they opened for her and the Blandshees...

*** East Side, newer, expensive club ***

At the East Side, bad news - they got AR 15, a former
Billy Idol cover band on Friday and then private parties
the rest of the weekend, y'know the kind where they invite
rock critics and ply them with cocaine... forget this place -

*** d.c. space *** (best bet)

19th dinner theater then john comstock (rockabilly)
20th madhouse/grey march (new wave/joy div. fans w/swerve)
21st nada, zilch, nothing.
22nd unrest (interesting band that doesn't play out that much
	      inspired by fred frith - ergo their name)

Also, there is a rumor that FLIPPER(!!!) and Die Kreuzen will be
playing that weekend at the infamous W.U.S.T. radio hall (home
of many gigantic hardcore brawls and happenings).  That should
be good as well as unrest... if you haven't seen them before
check out grey march and madhouse (they have the ex-guitar player
from beefeater, so it oughta be rad and all that).

Hope that helps - write me (couldn't figure out your address
with the net belching everything back at me - guess they "fixed"
it again, eh Horton?) for addresses, directions...

					"yeah, really gonna go
					 gonna ride on that open road"
							- great plains

					J.B. Hofmann
(maybe some others can add some more of the other clubs or plays
 or art junk happenin's?)
