OK, here goes:

All non-LP tracks by Kate Bush recorded to date in any format whatever:

"Maybe" (song recorded ca. 1973, with "Passing Through Air", which
         Kate played about a verse and a half of once on UK radio):
"Passing Through Air" (b-side of "Army Dreamers" single, recorded
         "on a summer afternoon at Dave's house", 1973)
"The Man with the Child in His Eyes" (the original 7" version, with
         a spoken introduction: "He's here...he's here...");
"The Empty Bullring" (b-side of "Breathing" single; Kate solo at piano);
"Ran Tan Waltz" (b-side of "Babooshka");
"December Will Be Magic Again" (Kate's Xmas single);
"Warm and Soothing" (b-side of "December Will Be Magic Again);
"Army Dreamers" (seven-inch version doesn't fade out, but goes on to
          the final note);
"Sing, Children, Sing" (7" by Leslie Duncan, on which Kate joins in
         singing the chorus -- virtually inaudibly);
"You (The Game, Part Two)" (song by Roy Harper on his Unknown Soldier
         LP -- a duet with RH);
"Another Day" (song by Roy Harper sung as a duet by Kate and Peter
         Gabriel on the "Kate" TV Xmas special);
Many miscellaneous bits of unreleased music from the various live
         performances, available only on bootlegs);
"Flowers" (song by Zaine Griff from his second LP -- a tribute to
         Lindsay Kemp on which Kate sings back-ups);
"Let It Be" (Kate sings live with Peter Gabriel and Steve Harley --
         appeared on rare Japanese KT fan club flexi-single);
"Sat In Your Lap" (seven-inch mix, slightly different from LP mix);
"Lord of the Reedy River" (b-side of "Sat In Your Lap"; song by
         Donovan, re-recorded by Kate with Donovan as back-up vocalist);
"The Dreaming" (seven-inch mix fades out completely, without the
         introduction from "Night of the Swallow");
"Dreamtime" (b-side of "The Dreaming" single -- a straight instrumental
         version of the LP track, except for the digeridu solo ending);
"Ne T'Enfuis Pas"(b-side of "There Goes a Tenner" single; re-released
         in re-mixed form (vocals higher in the mix) for the French and
         Canadian markets)
"Un Baiser d'Enfant" (b-side of French "Ne T'Enfuis Pas" single;
         French language version of "The Infant Kiss");
"No Self Control" and "Games Without Frontiers" (tracks from Peter
         Gabriel's third solo LP; Kate on back-up vocals);
"The Seer" (track from the eponymous LP by Doug's second favorite
         band Big Country; Kate on back-up vocals);
"Running Up That Hill" (instrumental and extended re-mix versions; from
         the twelve-inch single);
"Under the Ivy" (b-side of "Running Up That Hill");
"Cloudbusting" (the "Organon" (sic) twelve-inch mix; and an insert of
         additional music on the soundtrack from the promotional film);
"My Lagan Love" (b-side of "Cloudbusting"; traditional song sung a
         cappella by Kate);
"Burning Bridge" (second b-side of "Cloudbusting"; original song);
"Hounds of Love" (the "Alternative Hounds" mix on the twelve-inch);
"The Handsome Cabin Boy" (b-side of "Hounds of Love" single;
         traditional song sung by Kate with Fairlight);
"The Big Sky" ("Special Single Mix" from the seven-inch, and also
         the "Meteorological Mix" from the twelve-inch);
"Not This Time" (b-side of "The Big Sky" single);
"Experiment IV" (seven- and twelve-inch mixes);
"Wuthering Heights" ("New Vocal" mix);
"Brazil" (Kate's cover of the song for the soundtrack of the film,
          not yet released);
"The King is Dead" (song from forthcoming LP by Doug's favorite
          band Go West, not yet out).

Hopefully, Doug will alert IED if he has forgotten anything.
