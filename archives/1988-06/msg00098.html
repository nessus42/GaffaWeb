--------
   Well, I guess I've sat back watching long enough...I've got a few
things I'd like to say.  (Pardon me for being anti-conformist, but I
think I'll talk about Kate Bush...anyone ever hear of her????)
   I've been a Love-Hound for about five months...I've been a Kate
Bush fan for about two months.  I subscribed to pick up Kate info for
my girlfriend.  After reading all of these correspondences, I got
kinda curious.  I'm a big fan of Yes, Rundgren, Gabriel, Floyd,
Kansas, and the like, so I figured I would at least listen to
_The_Dreaming_, because it was said to be like Gabriel III.
Phenomenal!!!  I loved it.  The next album I listened to disapointed
me.  I guess I should expect flames from this, but it was
_Hounds_of_Love_.  And YES Doug I _DID_ listen to the album, thank
you!!  So then I went back, and listened to them all from the
begining.  I liked _The_Kick_Inside_ a lot, and _Never_For_Ever_ a
good bit, but _Hounds_of_Love_ barely inched out _Lionheart_.
Although, I must admit that none of them were bad.  I spent three
weeks, 12 hours a day, listening to Kate Bush in chronological,
reverse chron., and random order.  I started listening by album, and
then worked down to listening to each individual song.  While I was
doing this, I was reading and rereading all the Love Hounds print-outs
I have.  I'd like to thank all of you (especially Andrew Marvick) for
some valuable information and for introducing me to Kate, and I'd like
to say something that has been on my mind since day one:

             Doug, you must be the MOST conceited ass that I have
             ever had the displeasure of communicating with!!!

      [	And damn proud of it, too! -- |&gt;oug ]

   I have never met anyone so pompous as to suggest to an artist TO
HER FACE that he knows more about her songs than she does.  You remind
me of my high school English teacher.  And I think you're wrong...I
have to agree with Andrew Marvick's interpretation of the last two
verses of "There Goes A Tenner".  He seems to have a much more sound
theory.

      [	Well, it's you and IED that are wrong.  There's absolutely
        nothing in the song or the video to suggest the passing of
        large amounts of time inbetween the verses.  When she says,
        "Ooh, I remember...", the obvious and straightforward reading,
        is the obvious and straigtforward reading: that she is talking
        about the past.  Not that suddenly twenty years have whipped
        by without any indication whatsoever, and this past she's
        remembering is really the future.  That's a lame theory.  It
        is complicated, unnecessary, and doesn't explain anything that
        can't be explained by a simpler theory.

	Regarding me claiming to know more about her songs than Kate
        does: (1) I never did.  (2) Let's see if someone plops you
        down in front of your idol and see if you don't make a fool
        out of yourself.  (3) I wasn't trying to claim that I know
        more about Kate's songs than she does.  What I was trying to
        do was get information out of Kate that she doesn't like to
        give.  Kate is very secretive about some things, and will
        avoid the issue.  Some questions I asked her, she just
        wouldn't answer.  She wouldn't say she didn't want to answer
        -- she'd just answer a different question than I asked.  Take
        for example, her answer to my question about how she does
        audio palindromes: she wouldn't answer.  She would just say,
        "Oh yeah, it's really difficult and I plan on doing more of
        this kind of thing in the future."  Me: "But how do you do it,
        Kate?"  Kate: "Oh, I put in lots of work and effort and it
        comes out pretty good, don't you think?"  He brother had no
        qualms about answering this question when I asked him about it
        the next day.  Kate also wouldn't answer my question about the
        meaning of the song "My Lagan Love".  When I asked her
        brother, however, it turned it that he had written the lyrics,
        to this one song, and that his intentions with the song were
        precisely what I had predicted.  You certainly couldn't tell
        this from Kate's evasive answer, however.  When I hinted that
        I didn't believe everything Kate said, it wasn't because I
        thought she was wrong -- it was because I thought she wasn't
        telling everything, which it is still *painfully* obvious for
        many things, she wasn't.  -- |&gt;oug ]

   On an unrelated topic Doug says:

&gt;  Also, to claim that a song by Kate about the quest for perfection is totally
&gt;  unrelated and unconnected to her own quest for perfection in her life and
&gt;  art, would be completely inane and asinine.  -- |&gt;oug ]

   No argument with your logic, Doug (in this rare instance), but I
just found it infinitely ironic to hear you say that anything was
inane OR asinine.

	[ Perhaps.  But it's also just as ironic for you too. -- |&gt;oug ]

   Doug also says:

&gt;     [ |&gt;oug, as always, feels nastier than he sounds.  -- |&gt;oug ]
   
   Well, I was just wondering if Doug always feels as stupid as he
sounds.  I find it hard to believe that anyone intelligent enough to
get into MIT could believe half the stuff that Doug tends to spout to
the terminal.

       [ Well, as Einstein said, great minds will always face
	 opposition from mediocre ones.  At least I have a Philosophy
	 degree from MIT to prove that I may not be as stupid as you
	 think.  How are you going to prove to me that you're not as
	 stupid as you seem? -- |&gt;oug ]

   Damn, that felt good!  Now concerning that mess at UMass, I have to
confess that AC/DC has been my favorite group for the past 7 years (in
fact, I bought their latest CD right out of the box), and I'd really
like it if whoever posted that file (Joe Turner) could get this
message to that shallow bastard, NIM II:

      [	Pointing at that AC/DC is your favorite group was the way to
	do it!  -- |&gt;oug ]

      "Compared to Kate Bush, Brian Johnson can't sing for shit!!!" 

   Oh, and I really don't think that even if she had tried, Kate could
have made Gabriel's last album much worse than he had already made it
himself.  Not a very good album at all compared to the rest of his
collection.

   Other things of note:
     For those who care, the other day I was listening to _Powerslave_
(Iron Maiden) and noticed that a few of the guitar riffs are identical
to pieces of Mike Oldfield's _Tubular_Bells_.
     I also can't help noticing that the Bass work on Kate's later
albums (Del Palmer?) is extremely similar to, if not exactly like Tony
Franklin's (The Firm).

   Just one more thing before I go...is there anybody out there with
all of Kate's CD's who would be willing to make a tape for me?  I'd be
more than willing to reimburse you for the price of the tape and
postage.  If so, E-Mail me directly, and I'll give you details.
Thanks a lot.

{I just regained access to the account this was hiding on, so I dusted
it off and edited a couple of things.  I appologize for the
untimeliness of some of the issues.  Also, I would say that at this
point (3 months after the original composition), that _Lionheart_ has
edged out _HOL_ and is closing on _NFE_}

===============================================================================
Yes...
      Jon Anderson, Bill Bruford, Steve Howe, Chris Squire, and Rick Wakeman
                Could there be a more amazing and talented band?
                          No...
