Definitely look for _A_Book_of_Dreams_ if you can--it has to be one of
the most bizzare true stories I've ever read. It's not often that one
combines masturbation, psychology, radiation, rainmaking, the FDA, and
UFOs in the same work and still gets a readable story. It's
fascinating, though.

For those interested in Reich and his works--well, most of his stuff
is out of print or difficult to find.  I did get this great $6.95 (or
so) paperback at a Barnes and Noble-run bookstore here at Northwestern
called _Reich_for_ Beginners_.  It's a cartoon book, and makes his
life and theories understandable even to the non-psychologist.  The
drawings are kind of fun, too.  Just out of curiosity--did *my*
interpretation of "Suspended in Gaffa" reach anyone? My theories don't
coincide with anyone's I've seen.

Subject: May I be so humble...

...as to offer an interpretation of "Suspended in Gaffa" that no one
has yet presented during my brief time on the mailing list? Yes, I
admit it's rather superficial, and you will all strip the flesh from
my bones for it, but I feel compelled to say my piece.
        "Out in the garden" sets the scene, a couple in a garden.
Simple, eh?  Gets worse.... "Half of a heaven" means that the couple
in question cannot commit, as one of them is married. "we're only
bluffing, we're not ones for busting through walls" is the discression
of their meetings. They've been very careful, so careful that they
need to prove their infidelities in order to get the divorce ("unless
we can prove that we're doing it we can't have it all,"). I believe
that at one time in England the only way to get a divorce was to have
to prove in court that your spouse had been unfaithful by producing
the actual lover in court, or, at the very least, some witnesses
("who'll talk when he's called) to the infidelities. The rest of the
song is less clear, but it seems to be focussed on the fears of this
woman. She loves him, but there will be scandal. Is she doing the
right thing, being the party of this man's divorce ("he's gonna wangle
a way to get out of it")? She isn't even involved at this point, as
they have another woman willing to be held as the actual lover ("she's
an excuse") in court. But in the meantime, they are going to have to
be separated until the whole thing is over, to keep her name out of
the mud, and she is having her doubts about the whole thing. She
vacillates between wanting it all and bouts of tears and
self-exploration. She's in this thing way over her head, and hates
herself for doubting the relationship and her reasons behind it.
(Forgive me for not backing all this up with quotes-- I'm at work and
don't have my copy of "The Dreaming" just sitting next to me.)
        Ok, crucify me now. But I feel, somehow, this works on at
least one level of Kate interpretation. And, if any of you agree with
me on this one, I think it shows that there is never one single way of
interpreting a song (unless it's by Tiffany!). Kate's lyrics are too
much like poetry to ever be subject to a single set of rules.
