&gt; [IED:] But for god's sake, can't you refrain from making these
&gt; ridiculous statements that one of Kate's works is "better" than
&gt; another? Since they're all the product of her mature artistic
&gt; efforts, they're all sufficiently "good" -- whatever "good" means --
&gt; to be quite beyond our ability as mere Love-Hounds to rank them.
&gt; Have you no humility at all?

No, actually I don't.  

To maintain that all of Kate's work is of completely equal quality, I
think you would have to argue in a way that would lead you to the
conclusion that all art is of equal quality.  And that "better" and
"worse" are meaningless words when applied to art.  Since neither you
nor I would be willing to accept this conclusion, I think you better
get used to me saying that some of Kate's songs are better than some
other of her songs.

&gt;&gt; I still don't know the meaning of "Gaffa."  Since it's capitalized, I
&gt;&gt; guessed that it must be some sort of place, possibly imaginary?

&gt;&gt; -- Nick

&gt;&gt;  [ "Gaffa" is a European term gaffer's tape, which is the same
&gt;&gt;     thing as duct tape.  It is what musician's use to tape down
&gt;&gt;     wires and the like.  It is very sticky, and if you get stuck
&gt;&gt;     in it, it no fun at all.  -- |&gt;oug ]

&gt;     Like talking to a BRICK WALL. For the record, Nick, you make an
&gt; excellent point in observing the capital 'G' in 'Gaffa'. This (as well
&gt; as the extremely ambiguous use of the word -- or name -- in the song)
&gt; makes it virtually impossible for us to know exactly what Kate had in
&gt; mind when she used the word.
&gt;      IED and other Love-Hounds have pointed these facts out to our
&gt; pseudo-moderator _several_ times over the years, but nothing seems to
&gt; penetrate his monumental edifice of self-confidence.

You're right -- it *is* like talking to a brick wall, IED!  I have
pointed out to you many times over the years that Kate *herself* has
said that Gaffa is gaffer's tape.  You seem hell-bent on ignoring
Kate's own words.  Have you no humility at all?

&gt;      Just fyi, however, the Oxford E. D. lists (IED was recently
&gt; told by another Love-Hound) some _twenty-five_ possible definitions
&gt; of the word and its variants, any of which bears as much resemblance
&gt; to Kate's spelling "Gaffa" as does |&gt;oug's "gaffer's tape".

Well, IED, I just checked the OED, and it lists "gaffa" not once, much
less twenty-five times.  Of course, we wouldn't expect to find
musicians' jargon in the OED.  With respect to outside evidence, IED,
you seem to be forgetting that several months ago, a European musician
on this very mailing list, verified that indeed "gaffa" is jargon for
"Gaffer's tape".

You seem to think that it is some great mystery why "Gaffa" is
capitalized.  The explanation for this is simple:  either (1) Kate
thinks that "Gaffa" is a brand of gaffa tape, or (2) "Gaffa" *is* a
brand of gaffa tape.

If you ask me, it's pretty weird how you are unwilling to accept the
obvious, IED.  Do you think I could have made up something as bizarre
as gaffer's tape?  I would never had thought of gaffer's tape if Kate
hadn't said that this is what "Gaffa" is.  When I first heard the
song, I thought "Gaffa" was a brand of molasis, or something like
that.  Being "Suspended in Gaffa" sounded like being stuck in a sticky
and viscous fluid.  I wasn't to far off, after all, was I?  And that's
why when Kate said that "Gaffa" is gaffer's tape, it made perfect
sense.  Even though I would never have figured out that precise
meaning on my own.  So, what's the problem Mr. Marvick?  Do you think
I'm lying -- just making up things that Kate said, just to annoy you?
I think not.

if He wept also."
