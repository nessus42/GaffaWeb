<PRE>
     Late reports have surfaced of the release of TWO -- count 'em --
new books about Kate Bush. Added to the music books published thus
far, these constitute the eleventh and twelfth Kate Bush-related books
to date (not counting _The_Garden_, a publication of the possibly
imaginary Wickham Street Irregular Press).
     Even as the Love-Hounds read this, one book, a trade-size
paperback "scrapbook" made up of clippings and photographs of Kate,
has already started to turn up in import shops. It has been offered in
Los Angeles stores for $20.00
     Another book, entitled _The_Whole_Story_, should
show up very soon. This one is described as a hardback
"official biography" of Kate, and will be priced somewhere
around $30.00 (!). It is supposed to be a very up-market
production.
     Earlier, Peter FitzGerald-Morris announced plans to publish a
re-edited collection of his long _Homeground_ series "Five Years Ago"
in book form. IED speculates that _The_Whole_Story_ may in fact be
that book. The description of the hardcover book as an "official
biography" might very well fit the Fitzgerald-Morris project, since he
has already acted as Kate's fact-finder in a more or less official
capacity for the _Kate_Bush_Complete_ book.
     Rest assured that IED will provide Love-Hounds with a thorough
description of both new books just as soon as he can get his hands on
copies. Meanwhile, if anyone _else_ out there has any information,
please share it!
     In other news, Midge Ure's lead-off single to his forthcoming
second solo album has been released in 7" and 12" vinyl formats. IED
has not determined yet whether Kate is featured on any of the 12"'s
three tracks, but the album is due at any moment.
