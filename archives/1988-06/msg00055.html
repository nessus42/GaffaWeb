&gt;   Danielle Dax sounds kinda like a low budget Kate Bush.  She's
&gt;   also into the poly-ethnic rock sound.  She seems to have a
&gt;   thing for U.S. rockabilly, hillbilly, and country music on
&gt;   occasion, but fortunately, she keeps that to an acceptible
&gt;   amount.  She's pretty weird in general, and you can't go wrong
&gt;   by buying all her stuff.

What the fsck is a `low budget Kate Bush'?!?

Good grief, Danielle doesn't sound anything like KB to these ears ...

`Keeps that to an acceptable amount'?  Shee-it, bro, listen to `Evil
Honky Stomp' again and eat those words ...

Better yet, buy the recently released `Janice Long Sessions' 12" and
salivate to the great versions of `Fizzing Human Bomb', `Pariah',
`Ostrich', and a previously unreleased song, `Numb Companions'.  Plus,
as an added bonus, there's a `Holy Shit, so THAT's what she really
looks like!  Drool ....' head shot photo of her on the cover as well.

I hate to be blasphemous (I guess this is roughly akin to the
Christians entering the Colloseum and yelling `Caesar is a
homosexual!' or something (-: ) but by now I consider Danielle Dax's
music far more interesting than Kate's.  Sorry ...

Ignoring the arguability of that statement for a moment, it's
certainly far more interesting than anything the Sinead O'Conner |
Suzanne Vega | Jane "Gosh, I'm so enigmatic" Siberry | Tracy
"Buckwheat" Chapman brigade have to offer.  One spin of `House-Cat'
(on the B side of her last single, `Cathouse') is enough to convince
me of that.

      [	I'm sorry if I offended your sensibilities, Greg.  I didn't
	mean to imply that Danielle is any way derivative of Kate
	Bush.  She is an original.  I do think, however, that her
	music is many ways similar to that of Kate Bush and that
	people who like one have a very good chance of liking the
	other.  Both make progressive pop music with eclectic and
	ethnic influences.  Both do interesting and peculiar things
	with their voices.  Danielle Dax recording budget is much more
	modest that Kate's, however.  Her first two records, *Pop Eyes*
	and *Jesus Egg that Wept* were recorded on a four track in
	Danielle's home, and she played almost all the instruments.
	Her latest album, *Inky Bloaters*, is a more extravagant
	production.  I'm not particularly crazy about Dax's hillbilly
	music, but it doesn't bother me either.  If she only did weird
	hillbilly music, I wouldn't listen to her much.  But when she
	does something with an Indian melody and a double speed
	Aborigine beat, it really gets my hormones going.

	In any case, "Numb Companions" is not a previously unreleased
	song.  It is on either *Jesus Egg That Wept* or *Pop Eyes*.  I
	don't remember which offhand because lately I've been
	listening to the Japanese CD which is the sum of the two.
	Regarding what Danielle Dax looks like -- you just can't
	really tell from pictures until you see her live, which I did
	a couple months ago.  The gig was mind-blowing and Danielle
	moved around continuously like a cat in heat while singing all
	my favorite songs.  I was in the front row and about 9 inches
	away from Danielle.  She sweated all over me.  That was even
	better than seeing her run around nude in *The Company of
	Wolves*.  I'm told that this concert is the only concert she
	has ever done in the states, and you MISSED it!

	Regarding Suzanne Vega and Sinead O'connor -- they are
	absolutely nothing alike, and certainly don't deserve to be
	lumped together with Jane Sleepberry.

	-- |&gt;oug

	P.S.  Does anyone know where I can get a hold of any Lemon
	Kittens albums (i.e. the group Danielle Dax was in before
	going solo.) ]
