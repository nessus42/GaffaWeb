&gt;        To me SiG represents a persons struggle to be what they want
&gt; to be in life. Thus the continuous "I want it all", and "she can't
&gt; have it all". The chorus is about the feeling that one has when one
&gt; is trying to make their way through life, do the best they can, and
&gt; everything seems to be against them. Everything is slow, nothing
&gt; gets done or happens fast.  It feels like all creativity and ability
&gt; are tied up - suspended in gaffa.  How would you feel trying to do
&gt; something, suspended from a ceiling by gaffa tape.  Uncomfortable
&gt; I'm sure. And gaffa tape is so damn sticky and strong.

&gt;        In some ways the 2nd verse echos "Sat in Your Lap".  The whole
&gt; idea of seeming to get somewhere, but in truth being at the start all
&gt; over again.  Thus the "pull out the plank and say thank you for
&gt; yanking me back to the fact that there's always something to
&gt; distract..." Perhaps it's just the way I feel at the moment, in some
&gt; sort of boring limbo, but that's the way the song comes over to me.

&gt;	[ |&gt;oug agrees with you exactly, and this is always been the
&gt;	  meaning he has associated with the song.  He also thinks
&gt;	  that theme of the lyrics is very similar to "Sat In Your
&gt;	  Lap".  It's good  to see that there is another sane person
&gt;	  out there!  -- |&gt;oug ]

Hmm.  Maybe I missed it, but when did |&gt;oug start talking about himself
in the third person?  Is this a result of his extended exposure to IED?

      [	|&gt;oug has admittedly perused much written material by IED, his
	intellectual sparing partner on matters Kateological, but to
	maintain that IED's inimitable style is rubbing off on |&gt;oug,
	would be an unsupportable and patently upsurd position.  --
	Douglas Alan ]

Alex must say, Stephen, that he very much agrees with your feelings about 
Suspended in Gaffa, and is glad to see that there are some sane people out
there.
