bills to pay so it's time to part with it. Everything here is original
unless otherwise
noted and bought when the vinyl originally came out. Promo copies are
shown on
the label unless otherwise noted. If you have any questions, please email
me. This
info will also probably run in Goldmine soon. If I find more stuff around
the house,
I'll post it. All bids are in U.S. Currency but orders from anywhere in
the world will
be accepted. 

                    Auction will close on September 8, 1996
