hey people.

        the "neiman.marcus.urban.legend" cookies are pretty good.
        "Sixteen Stone" isn't a kate album.
        I work in radio and recently had the fun chance to do a "BushBlock,"
which means I went from "Glycerine" by Bush to "And So Is Love" by Kate.  I'd
like to do one featuring a Bush song and then go to "Get Out of my House," but
that'll have to wait till Winter Quarter.
        picked up 2 cds this weekend that pertain to some discussions here.
One was Liz Phair's "Juvenalia," which has 8 songs on it, including "Jealousy"
from her current album "Whip.Smart" and then a cover of that masturbation
anthem "Turning Japanese" with Material Issue.  The last 5 songs are from
"Girlysounds" which is her self.distributed pre.fame days tape... maybe this
would be a format for Kate to consider.  Redo the best of the demos for Bsides,
or just issue them as.is, like on "Juvenalia" with tape hiss and all, as
collectable Bsides.
        The second CD is David Bowie's new one "1.Outside" - which is the 1st
of a planned 5CD story arc featuring different characters.  Now "The 9th Wave"
is a story, but imagine what someone like Kate Bush could do with this kind of
concept.  She's a natural storyteller, one of the best song.story writers
anyone has ever seen... the mind boggles.  As a natural, raw film director,
imagine it as film.
        This seems like just the concept she could sink her teeth into.
"TLTCTC" was a kind of filmic "concept album" in it's own right, and an
expansion on "TRS."
        Just think about it... wow.
        Jane Siberry's new one "Maria" is wonderfully jazzy.  My roomie works
in public radio and will be returning to his old job doing "JazzNights" for
WOUB, heard over half of ohio and WVA in the new year.  His eyes popped out at
"Lovin' Cup."
        I do adore Siberry.
        Kate Touring:  You know we have very biased opinions on this.  Look at
it from a non.lovehounds perspective.  Kids aren't going to go, because for a
lot of people i know, she's a one hit wonder.  That's right.  Most people go,
oh yeah, "Rubberband Girl... okay..."
        Those wonderful elders of mine are going to actually remember "TSW,"
which i was blessed enough to discover in my first year of high school (It kept
me alive, actually, during my disgruntled youth) and more importantly, "HOL"
and the earlier albums.  If Kate was going to tour, yes, she'd have to get
media people and managers to devote themselves to advertising this once in a
lifetime event.
        Europe would be an easy tour.  America would be a challenge she could
rise to.
        Sadly, because there are people with extravagantly bad taste, to tour,
she's going to have to put out a "Mathematically.engineered.hit machine" of an
album, which wouldn't be too difficult for someone of her talents.  "TSW" and
"TRS" should have done that in america.  Hell, she should be on the radio alot.
 Kate is picky and perfectionistic and that's why WE love her, and more
importantly, RESPECT the woman and her work.  But she needs airwaves to fill
seats.
        To tour without losing her shirt (not a word, people!) she'd have to
have a hit, and she'd have to stick to large cities and small clubs...  Think
about it, cross America's major cities with a band, dancers, pyrotechnics, and
play midsized stadiums, and she'd fill the seats.  That gets one across the
country, and then on her way back across, do something smaller and hit the
music.clubs.  Imagine Kate Bush in a place like Bogart's in Cincinatti... with
a piano, a small band, and just some intimate pieces.
        Actually I would love to see Kate pound out some amazing studio work
and then go tour.
        She could write and produce some work for other people... hell, picture
Kate producing and writing and working with someone like Trent Reznor, or (Not
a word, people!) Tori Amos... it really would be something to think about.
        She needs public accessability, and she can do this with little
compromise... then an album, a tour, Television, even empty television, and
then i predict Kate will once again have true music industry domination.

Actually, this is nothing more than a precisely engineered plan to place the
entire music industry under her rule...  A short, vegan smoker ruling the
universe is a wonderful image isn't it?

anyhow, got to go to the bank, and i've rattled enough, (sorry bandwidth
people)

LOVE AND TWINKIES JAY=)
