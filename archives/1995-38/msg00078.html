As Happy Rhodes says: Dreams are!

-------------------
Date:    Wed, 24 May 89 09:13 PDT 
From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu 
Subject: Was Freud ever right about dreams being wish-fulfillment fantasies! 

     IED is further gone than he realized. The last two mornings he was
awakened much earlier than is normal for him--thereby apparently having his
REM sleep interrupted. Normally IED doesn't retain any memory of his
dreams, but these special circumstances opened his eyes (ha).

     On the first morning he had been dreaming of a magical library. IED
asked the reference librarian if they carried any of the works of Kate
Bush, and lo and behold, she led me to a whole shelf of file- boxes. In
these boxes were dozens of records, CDs and photographs, and among the
records were a large number of Kate's early home-recordings.
     Then IED woke up. The day was a total loss. 

     Then this morning he dreamt that he was at a record swapmeet. Just as
he was about to leave he saw another visitor with a new Kate bootleg
compact disk in his hand. It looked almost like the bootleg-CD of the
_Hammersmith_ concert, but on closer examination its cover-photo was
different. IED asked if he could inspect it, and the visitor grudgingly
obliged. Lo and behold, what should the CD's track-listing include, but at
least twenty hitherto-unknown early demo-recordings by Kate--including one
entry marked "Songs (recorded between ages 5 and 8)". 
     Then IED woke up. The day is going to be a total loss. 
-- Andrew Marvick 
------------------------
in a later posting:

IED seems to remember (but from what source he cannot say) that Kate once
said the name [Babooshka] was inspired from some old children's story she
had read long before. This is not confirmed, however, and in fact IED is
not at all certain that he ever actually read this anywhere. It could have
been a dream. (See, as many of you will not be surprised to learn, IED
tends to have Kate Bushological dream experiences at any and all times of
the day and night. It's very distressing sometimes.) 
-------------------------

Kate Bushological dream experiences! I know this sooo well....

best wishes
    Wieland
