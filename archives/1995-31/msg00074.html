I couldn't resist to bring back this wonderful song into your mind. I love
it so much and I listened to it nearly the whole evening. Please come with
me and enjoy. You have it at home on a CD! 
You want Alchemy? You want ALCHEMY?
You can find your own Magical Mystery Tour...

"She smiled and held my hand
I knew that she would see 
for she dreams of touching beauty, too."

What a lovely afternoon 
On a cloudbusting kind of day. 
We took our own 'Mystery Tour' 
And got completely lost somewhere up in the hills. 
And we came up on a bee-keeper, 
And he said "Did you know they can change it all?" 

You want alchemy. 
They turn the roses into gold 
They turn the lilac into honey 
They're making love for the peaches. 

And we're thinking, 
"Who is this guy?" 
"Is he some kind of nut or what?". 
He said, "I don't meet many people..", 
"I'm very busy with the hives.". 
ZzzzZzzzz.. Sun's gone down.. 

"When's my cloud of bees coming home?". 

They got alchemy. 
They turn the roses into gold 
They turn the lilac into honey 
They're making love for the peaches. 

And they'll do it, 
Do it for you. 
They'll do it, 
Do it for you. 

"And if you see them, send 'em right on home to me" 

(what they gonna do...?) 
They got Aaaaaaaa.. 
Turn the roses into gold. 
And they'll do it for you 
Do it for you (what they gonna do...?) 
I'll tell Yaaaaaa... 
Making love for the peaches. (what they gonna do...?) 
Daaaaaamaaaaakiiiiindaaaaa honey. 

(they do it for you) 
They do it for you. 

And why not...? 
They bring me so much pleasure. 

-------------------------------------
This is so magic: 
    "Did you know, they can change it all?"
    "They make love for the peaches."
    "And if you see them, send 'em right on home to me."

You want alchemy? You want ALCHEMY?
Here it is.
