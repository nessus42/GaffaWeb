Pink Floyd:  The Play

personae opperandi
------------------
The Moderator - has the only lines in the play, for the most part he hangs
by wires out of reach of the rest of the players.  He is covered from neck
on down in aluminum foil.  His face is madeup like that of a clown, pastey
white, reddened mouth, but his eyes are both blackened and he is bald. Under a 
death clause in his contract the actor is never allowed to smile.  In his left 
hand he holds the Rolling Stone Guide to Rock And Roll.

The Fan - spends most of the play traveling from one giant, oversized
stereo speaker to the other.  Should be modeled after Tik-Tok, the Mechanical
Man from Oz.  He is constantly falling over or getting kicked or spat 
on by Roger Waters.  He wears two oversized headphones that are connected
to the sofa, center stage.

The Critics - dressed like Tweedledee and Tweedledum except they have
Rolling Stone suspenders and cut-off, frayed, denim jeans.  The rest of
their wardrobe is like T &amp; T's - striped shirt, freshman beanie cap,
salad- bowl haircuts etc.  They have a big hole in their costume 
that exposes their rear ends.  In each act, a message is written 
on their butts which is constantly shown to the audience when
they pick up the fan or are knocked over by Waters.

The Drummer and The Organist - bit players.  Throughout the play 
except the Prologue, they keep their backs to the audience.
They are dressed as the actual Pink Floyd musicians are dressed in the
Umma-Gumma LP.

David Gilmour - again he is dressed like on the Umma-Gumma LP. He
also has a big chain tied around his neck that is usually held
by Waters.

Roger Waters - the villain, dressed in a pink Tu-Tu, Elton John style
high-heels, rockstar sunglasses, frayed and tattered jeans and a wig
of long, curley, goldenlocks.

Syd Barrett - the tragic hero, played by a blow-up Bozo punching doll.
---------------------------
Prologue 
--------
A strobe light is on.  In the middle of the stage the Drummer, the Organist,
David Gilmour and Roger Waters are writhing in hellfire, an endless 
agony.  Waters stands above the rest.  Center Stage Front is a coffin 
where the Fan lies, dead.  On either side of the coffin are the Critics
with their heads bowed low in solemn prayer.  Their rear ends are now
hid from the audience.
