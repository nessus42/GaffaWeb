&lt; I complain about Laurie Anderson's uninteresting Sat. Nite Live performance &gt;
&lt; Peter Alfke agrees she might be going the way of Talking Heads &gt;

Actually, I thought Speaking in Tongues was a natural thing for Talking Heads
to do after Eno stopped working with them. I could forgive them for that
reason, and there were actually a few clever songs on S.I.T. What I
don't forgive Talking Heads for is that travesty Little Creatures, but
I've already flamed about that months ago, so... I don't see what excuse
Laurie Anderson has (other than monetary) for going to a more popular
sound. You could at least argue for the Heads that they had to do SOMETHING
different after ditching Eno.

Another interesting point Peter brought up: what would you consider the
sound of the '80s (at least where relatively progressive music is concerned)?
Not that there was really a "sound of the '70s" or anything... It
seems that one of the trends I like is the integration of different 
musical styles and idioms, like the art-funk Peter mentioned that sounded
so vital and fresh on old Material tracks, Eno-era Talking Heads, etc.
There's also Fred Frith's work with avant-rock and fake ethnic music,
Kate's stuff in a similar vein, some stuff by However which is heavily
free-jazz influenced, classical/avant-classical ideas in Univers Zero
and Art Zoyd, psychedelia and hardcore, etc. Maybe the sound of the '80s
(whatever that is) will be distinguished by this fusion of many musical
styles. Comments?
