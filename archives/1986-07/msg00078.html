Rob Rosen Rites:

&gt;    I've heard that the Milton Keynes recording is in mono.  There's a
&gt;    French 3 record set, recorded sometime between '78 and '80 (it might
&gt;    have been the '78 Chicago concert) which I think is also in mono.
&gt;    Can anyone confirm?
&gt;        Swelled and Spent is a pretty good quality recording.  There are
&gt;	some good PG stories on that one.

There are TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS of the reunion concert: One is in an
attractive red package with some pretty cool pix on the outside and is
credited to "Gabacabriel". This bears the title "Milton Keynes 2nd October
1982". It is in stereo, has some crowd noise, but overall is very good quality.
The bass fuzzes sometimes, and the concert techs couldn't mike Gabriel well
anyway, but other than that it's fine. Be warned, while they DID do "The Knife"
in concert, it is NOT on the album.

The second version is called "Reunion", and is attributed to "Peter Gabriel
and the Genesis" [sic]. It's only two records, and I wouldn't trust it.

&gt;     do NOT under any circumstances spend any more than $5 for A Death in
&gt;     Anytown!!

Second Coming Records has it for $20. Yeesh.

&gt;     If you can find a '75 disc called "Awed Man Out (1975 British Tour)",
&gt;     buy it.  It's a compilation of stuff from the Lamb tour and it has
&gt;     an INCREDIBLE 11 or so minute version of "The Waiting Room."  Also
&gt;     get "Genesis As Thru Emerald City", another compilation.  Very high
&gt;     recording quality with a great version of "The Musical Box" and the
&gt;     two classic B sides "Twilight Alehouse" and "Happy the Man." 

I've seen it, and the other record produced by the same group is "The Bedside
Yellow Foam" which is awful good. A little hollow, but OK.

I picked up what I thought was a Europe-only Gabriel release called
_Con-Tact!_ a few days ago. It looked like it was a _Plays Live_ twin, except
it had three records, not two, and a number of other songs on it that were
sadly lacking on _PL_ (like "Humdrum" and "Here Comes the Flood", to name
two). It was on red vinyl and cost a hefty $50. I picked it up immediately,
of course!

Upon getting home with it, I noticed the following things in the following
order:
	1)  It had words and cool pix!
	2)  It truly was on red vinyl!
	3)  The sound quality was shit!
	4)  It was from "Charming Records", not Charisma!
	4a) The Mad Hatter logo was yawning!
	5)  It was marketed by "PhonyGram", not PolyGram!
        5a) The Polygram logo was a winking smiley-face!
	6)  It was a bootleg!
	7)  I had been duped!!

I normally have an eye for detail that can spot things like this. This album
had so much financial backing it was sickening. The slickness of this album
is incredible. The records even had the correct track timings on the perfectly
printed labels! It looked real. It sounds like a bootleg, though. The instru-
ments are great, the crowd is great... the vocals are there, somewhere, and
they're great... I think...

{} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {} {}

Pay up to $10 for the Tears For Fears bootleg "Memories", but no more. It's
awfully good, but Roland and Curt sound like they have colds...

Later.

				Save your parity bits for big cash prizes!
