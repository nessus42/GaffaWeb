Pete Alfke pens:

&gt;Has anyone noticed that Brian Eno's "King's Lead Hat" and the Cars'
&gt;"Shake It Up" have the exact same chord progressions in the verses?

I never noticed it until I played KLH for my mainstream-pop buddies in
high school to try and get them out of their shells. The only comment
was "It sounds like Shake It Up." I said "Blah!" and took my record
home, never to attempt to broaden their tiny heads again... never took
it serious, tho!

Well. The first mention of "Sledgehammer" has appeared in the current
New Musical Depressed. Here it is, in all it's ugly glory...

PETER GABRIEL: Sledgehammer
(Virgin)
"Open up your   fruit-cage,"    sings
Peter,  "I    wanna be  your   honey-
bee."  Something  is   up   in Pete's
world    of  silly  monkey    make-up
and  arch    gestures.  He  has  been
played  a Phil   Collins record.  And
he   has  watched   amazed   as   his
little bearded  chum,    the   cheery
chappy    drummer    from     halcyon
days of sell-out   college gigs,  has
turned  into  every  Renault   Five's
cassette     pet.      `Sledgehammer'
follows  Collins'  production    line
"soul" struts, is intercut with brass
and  backing    vocals,   and    even
Gabriel's   whine  is        tailored
towards a Hall &amp; Oates  cut. I  fully
expect   to  see   Gabriel on  Top of
The    Pops,   wearing   a  cool blue
suit, RayBans,   and   a skinny  tie.
And      wearing     bloody    stupid
monkey make-up.

Oh blah. It's still selling well, at least.

'tis official, fair people:

	KATE BUSH: 'The Big Sky' (EMI) from her LP 'Hound of Love'.
	B-side is the brand-new 'Not This Time', the 12" bonus is
	'The Morning Fog' -- out next Monday.

Gee, that's today...

Later.
