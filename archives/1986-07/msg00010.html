At this point, A. Marvick is resigned to the apparent
failure of the U.S. follow-up single "Hounds of Love".
The seven-inch version has been widely available for
more than three weeks now, yet it is still unlisted in
either the Billboard or the more optimistic Cashbox
Top 100 charts; as a result, MTV have absolutely no
intention of even considering air-time for the film.
Furthermore, it is not listed by any of the playlists
recently published in Billboard, nor is it on any dj's
"bubbling under" lists or "pick" lists. Perhaps in
reaction to this indifference to the single, EMI seem
to have scratched plans (if such plans ever existed)
to release the twelve-inch version domestically; and
there has been no visible promotion for the single.
If anyone out there among the lion/love-hearts/hounds
is more optimistic in the face of the above barrage of
bad news, let him/her speak soon. My explanation for
this apparent failure is two-fold:  first, it is possible,
even in the snail-paced Stateside music business, to
let too much time pass between the release of an album's
first single and its follow-up, and this, due to the
delay in delivering the promotional film for "Hounds
of Love", may have been the case here; second, there
is fiercer competition from the hordes of "seasoned
American pop artists" now than there may have been
last summer/fall. My suggestion is, for those devoted
Kate fans who just spent hours trying to request the
"Cloudbusting" film from MTV, that they schedule another
dial-a-thon to that infamous corporation, but with
the new U.S. single in mind, not a Europe-only release
like "Cloudbusting". A similar project might be undertaken
with EMI-America as the target, with the aim of encouraging
the release of a twelve-inch, now that the seven-inch
of "Hounds of Love" has had time to sow the seeds of
interest among the poor benighted, swindled-of-music
American people. Waiting to hear any comments from
l/l-h/h's nation-wide...
