 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: Mailbag

   Erratum: IED's recent posting of a letter from Kate to Frances
Byrne was mis-dated. The actual date of the letter was 1976, not
1975. Sorry about this mistake, which was caused by a discrepancy
between the Mayes/Cann chronology and the evidence (or lack of same)
provided by Kate's undated letter to Frances Byrne, as well as a
vagueness in Peter's own chronology. See Touch the Past 2, appearing in
Love-Hounds soon, for clarification.
   Joe Britt: IED has never managed to decipher completely the
three prose/poetry readings heard in the Tour of Life concerts, but
he does have most of it. Unfortunately he has never transcribed the
words, so it may be a little while before IED manages to post them.
Excellent request, though!
   Eric: Despite what you may have heard, there has _never_ been
any evidence that the cloudbuster was actually designed by H. R. Giger.
On the contrary, the official credit (on the back of the single) goes
to a Ken Hill. Certainly the KT cloudbuster is in the _style_ of Giger,
but there have been many such Gigeresque creations.
   Jeff: IED would not pay more than $18.00 tops for the Baktabak
("electric-mandolin-photo") interview-CD, though it _is_ a better
product than some of the interview items out there.
   Regarding the news (thanks, Ed Suranyi, for the thorough and
much-appreciated summary of the 38th issue of _HG_!) that Paddy Bush
may design the cover of Roy Harper's forthcoming album: it is worth
noting for the record that John Carder Bush _already_ provided (and
is given credit for) the cover-design for one of Harper's recent
albums. (Sorry, IED can't recall the title.) This same CD credits
piano and backing-vocals to one improbably named "Jackie Turnip", who
IED is told sounds suspiciously like Kate Bush...No confirmation is
possible from IED, who has not yet heard the recordings personally.
Sorry.
   Mike Pritchard: It was interesting to see that the person(s) who
designed that KT program were as knowledgeable and energetic as they
seem to have been. Could you identify the fan(s) who made up the
show? Also, the first entry in the program was vague: what did you
mean by "Kate Bush: In Depth Profile"? Evidently _not_ "Profiles in
Rock", since you mention that later on in the list. Was this then
a home-made slide-show, or video-show, or what?
   Evan: There have been two _TSW_ t-shirts mentioned in Love-Hounds
to date. One is the official KBC shirt, which IED has one of (ordered
through an order-form in the latest KBC _Newsletter_): it is all
black, with very thin gold letters down the front right side reading
simply "THE SENSUAL WORLD . KATE BUSH", and on the back a stylized
circular design of three flowers, also in thin gold lines. The other
t-shirt is the (probably unofficial) design which some Love-Hounds
have mentioned showed up in London shops. It features the sand-
through-hand shot on a white shirt, with red letters.
   However, the present announcement in _HG_ seems to indicate that
_Columbia_ in the U.S. has produced its _own_ t-shirt design, and
that's why Ed was excited. (IED too.) Anyone with information about
such a U.S.-made _TSW_ t-shirt, please inform the group pronto about
ways of obtaining them! Thanks.
