Greetings once again...

What is the name of the unauthorized biography of Kate in which she is
constantly compared to Celtic mythological figures, and finally in the
concluding paragraphs is declared an actual deity with the sentence, "Kate Bush
is our goddess Frig"?

If these people who are deifying her are doing it all in fun, then I'll join in
the active worship: my friends introduce me to people with, "This is Meredith-
she worships Kate Bush," and I nod my head and grin.  But if any of you are
serious about this (which I'd like to doubt), that's truly frightening.

Kate is awesome, as a composer, singer, video artist,and woman.  But could we
please get this perfectly clear: *she's human*.  She's mortal, just like us, and
she was born of fully human parents, no vrigin birth or anything, the same way
we all were.  Got it?

My apologies for this interruption to all of you who, like me, revel in our
fandom.  But to those of you who may be out there who seriously believe that
she's a goddess (and as I said before I don't think that happens, but you never
know- in a group of 11,000 people, lots of weird things can occur), GET A CLUE.

Fanatic fanaticism leads to horrible results.  So if any of this applies to
you, seek help immediately!  We wouldn't want some crazed fan shooting Margaret
Thatcher to get KT's attention, or anything (well, maybe, but that's not the
point)...
