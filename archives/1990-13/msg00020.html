<PRE>
Vickie here. I owe lots'o'people lots'o'letters--with our vacation
coming up I've been too swamped at work'n'home to get back to some
of you. Please forgive and hold off on that vow to never write again
'cos I never answer. I will, I will, I really really will!

Chris &amp; I both are on a cloud and we haven't even left on vacation yet.
We haven't taken a trip anywhere for a few years so we're excited about
that, plus the fact that it's going to be a "concert" vacation, seeing
all kinds of wonderful people (most would never ever come to Kansas City).
We had bought and paid for our plane tickets to Chicago to see the
Bulgarian Chorus months ago. When Jane's schedule was announced we tried
to get our original tickets changed but couldn't. That's why there's the
weirdness of going up, coming back and going up again!


Here's the concert itinerary for our double trip to Chicago:

4/12 Leave KC early morning-see MARTA SEBESTYEN &amp; MUSZIKAS that evening
4/13 LE MYSTERE DES VOIX BULGARES
4/14 CATERWAUL w/ BETSY MARTIN
4/15 Day of rest (unless something comes up...:-)
4/16 Fly back to KC
4/17 Sleep all day :-)
4/18 LAURIE ANDERSON in Lawrence, KS (about 30 miles away)
4/19 Leave KC early morning-see JANE SIBERRY that evening
4/20 MICHELLE SHOCKED /w POI DOG PONDERING 
4/21 Fly back to KC early morning, put my show together and try to be
     somewhat coherent on the air that evening!
 
The anticipation of seeing 7 (count 'em!) 7 TOP FAVORITES in less than
a week and a half is more than our little hearts can stand! Tingles galore!
I knew I was saving my vacation time for something (Kate? hah!) and I'm
glad I did. Chris has got one of those jobs that gives him lots of leeway
in taking time vacation (as in: I'm-The-Only-Person-In-This-Entire-City-Who-
Knows-How-To-Run-This-Computer-Graphics-System-So-My-Job-Will-No-Question-
Be-Waiting-For-Me-When-I-Return!).

You lucky people who live in cities where people of the above calibur play
all the time probably tend to sometimes take it for granted. Just remember
the couple who took their vacation time, saved and borrowed money and took
2 seperate round-trip flights to be able to see these kinds of concerts!
Count your blessings!

                  ----------------------------
                         !SUSAN!
