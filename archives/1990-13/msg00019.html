&gt; A quick note of thanks to Vickie (of Chris 'n Vickie fame, of course)
&lt; for posting the lyrics to Roy Harper's "Another Day".  I've wanted
&gt; those words for years!  Many thanks, Vic!  :)
&lt;                                           All the best,
&gt;                                                 Deb Wentorf

&gt; Thanks for posting the lyrics, Vickie !
&lt; Declan

Thanks for the thanks. You're welcome!

Christopher Oliver asks:

&gt; In terms of national nets, where and what is world.std.com.  I've tried
&lt; to send stuff there on vanilla flavored internet without success.

World is based in Boston and is run by the very nice people at Software
Tool &amp; Die. It has a direct UUCP link to UUNET in Virgina, at least we
think it does because when we use the "uuname" command UUNET is one of
the machines listed. So whatever path you normally use to sent through
UUNET should work. It's a fairly new site so its domain address might
not be on all the machines that you are sending through. We are still
figuring out this stuff ourselves, so we don't have an old internet
"bang" address worked out. Try "...!uunet!world!katefans" or
"...!uunet.uu.net!world.std.com!katefans" Hope this helps.

jsd quotes me:

&gt;&gt; Caterwaul is a band I've fallen in love with, but I don't recommend them.
&gt;&gt; Why? Because they're a "either love 'em or hate 'em" band and I don't
&gt;&gt; want to be responsible for someone going out and buying their albums and
&gt;&gt; ending up using them as frisbees. It's hard to guess who will like them.
&gt;&gt; "Ethereals" and people who love truly unusual female voices will probably
&gt;&gt; love Betsy Martin's vocals but might be put off by the heavy guitar-based
&gt;&gt; rock. "Rockers" who'll listen to nearly anything with guitars &amp; drums
&gt;&gt; might despise Betsy's voice and vocal style. It's impossible for me to
&gt;&gt; say "you will like this" because not everyone is as weird as I am :-)

then adds his 2-b:
 
&gt; Well, I'll recommend Caterwaul then to everybody.  Because I'm sure
&gt; everybody will listen once and go "euuuew YECH!" and throw it away,
&gt; only to realize a few months later that they threw out something of
&gt; incredible depth and sophistication.  It sounds kinda like Siouxsie
&gt; Sioux meets Led Zeppelin or something, except for the quiet ones which
&gt; sound like Jane Siberry on bad acid.  Personally, I think they're
&gt; great although it took a few listens to get the hang of Betsy's wail,
&gt; but then again, I used to think Kate was too weird.

Glad you like them! However, I wouldn't want anyone to think that Betsy
sounds anything like Souxsie or Jane, that would be misleading.
Betsy sounds like......um.......well........ur......um.......let's
see.......ur......how about........no.......um.......uh..........gee..
.......um.....OK, Betsy doesn't sound like anyone else on this planet.
I can't speak for the rest of the universe.
Betsy is one of two people I can think of who have absolutely, utterly
and completely *** UNIQUE *** voices. (Victoria Williams is the other one)
You never have nor will you ever, hear anyone else who sounds like her.
She talks that way too! I interviewed her that last time Caterwaul played
around here.

&gt;&gt; =                 "Suspended in Gaffa" KKFI 90.1fm                      =
&gt;&gt; =                    Saturdays 10:00pm-12:00am                          =
&gt;&gt; =       Kansas City's Alternative alternative to boyz with guitarz      =

&gt; Caterwaul is nothing more than boyz with guitarz but with a weirdo
&gt; woman's voice superimposed.  Besides, she sounds like Robert Plant on
&gt; at least one or two songs... ("Big Ox Laughing" springs to mind...)

I disagree. 
I used to think that, right after I went  "euuuew YECH!" but before I
decided not to throw it away (to be specific, before I heard "Lay Down
To Rest"). I can't explain it, but Caterwaul are DIFFERENT. Besides,
Betsy has a lot of input. The guys write and play to and for her vocals.
She writes all the lyrics and plays the mandolin too. If I had to come up
with a phrase to describe their music, I'd say "gritty ethereal" is the
closest.
For those who have read this far and are still interested, here's a blurb
from IRS Records:
 "When you first hear Caterwaul, it's the sum, not the parts, that's most
compelling. Their gilded wall of sound strikes with authority and stark
precision. This, in turn, provides the backdrop for one of rock's most
unusual and compelling new instruments--the voice of Betsy Martin.
Betsy's kaleidoscopic swirl of emotion plays off the edgy guitar washes
of Mark Schafer and the unyielding rhythm section of bassist Fred Cross
and drummer Kevin Pinnt. Factor om an oblique repertoire that runs the
gamut of worldly (and other-worldly) moods, the production from Dennis
Herring that's as big as all outdoors, and you have one of the most
scintillating new musical expressions to challenge pop's present-day
parameters."

This was for the release of Caterwaul's 2nd album "Pin And Web", not
their current release "Portent Hue". I like P&amp;W better than PH but I
do like the new one too. I like their first album, "The Nature Of Things",
best of all.
The band is on a 29 city American tour now so if any of this intrugues
you at all, consider going if they come to your city.

Well, off to the windy city...
