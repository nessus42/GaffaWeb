&gt; September 1969
&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; Kate starts at St. Joseph's Convent Grammar School. "The Crucifixion",
&gt; the first of several poems by Catherine which would appear in
&gt; the school's annual magazine, appears in the end of the 1969-70 edition.

Just in time (well...) for the Easter holidays, I hereby present you with...


THE CRUCIFIXION

He is pushed forward from the steps,
Glistening eyes glare from around at the
  dropping figure.
Silence ceases and murmurs gather quickly
  like the grabbing of the hand.
Guilty onlookers hid their eyes from the
  shame that they know and forbid to
  reveal.
Slowly the dimness falls.
The man weeps and his forsaken tears fall
Slipping down the trembling and battered
  body onto the dust.
He collapses down onto the ground.
His head bruises past the stones, scarring his
  tear-stained face.
He staggers to his feet groping toward his 
  fate.
Sharply, iron pierces flesh, and the shape is
  raised on the hill.
Stillness overcomes the cheering spectators,
And the mocked and pride broken lead turns in outcry.
The people form and run down the hill.
With a last glance at his betrayers,
He dissolves into a limp, dumb body,
As the blood red sun sinks into the skull of a dead man.

   Catherine Bush
   (Form I)
   1969-1970
 


&gt; 1970
&gt; ^^^^
&gt;     At school, Kate is in Form II. She publishes three poems in that
&gt; year's school magazine: "A Tear and a Raindrop Met", "Death" and "You".

DEATH

A word could not harm me
A stone could not bruise me.
A gun could not shoot me.
  For I am not here.
Yet I come to receive you, to hold you
  To keep you.
For I am Death. I am here.
And I speak, yet you are dumb,
  You cannot hear
  That I am here,
But now I am gone.
And you come too.

   Catherine Bush
   (Form II) 
   1970-1971

YOU

You are a person, of unknown reasons.
Reacting with movements, and noises,
You may be bold, wear glasses, or have freckles,
Yet inside _you_ there may be great feelings
Of beauty and love, fighting to appear
On the pimpled surface.
It reaches out -- "I love you"
A laugh, a jeer
The feelings are trapped and you,
You -- disappear.


-------------------------

That's all I have time to type in now, the others will have to wait
'till next week (unless somone else can get to them first).
These were taken from Paul Kerton's biography, commonly known as:
"Kate Bush--An Illustrated Biography".

IED, I'm confused. In PK's book, the other "Form II" poems are titled
"I Have Seem Him" and "Call Me". Where did "A Tear and a Raindrop Met"
appear?

Could someone tell me the American equivalent of "Forms"? (Freshman,
Sophmore, Junior, Senior). I could figure it out but I'm too lazy.
While we're at it, Kate got 10 "O" Levels. What are they? And what
are "A" Levels? Someone told me once and I've totally forgotten. 


------------------------
"Concert Vacation" Pt. 1 was wonderful...
The BEST is yet to come!
