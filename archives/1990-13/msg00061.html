Well, _Homeground_ #38 just arrived.  I'll type in some items
of interest.

First of all, I was astounded to see that in February, the album
was actually charting higher in the US than in the UK!  From my
postings, you may remember that in the US the album went from 49 to 61 in
that month.  Well, in the UK the album went from 51 to 66 in the same 
period.  This is undeniably the only time such a thing has happened!

Gary Hurst died of AIDS at the end of January.  "Gary's contributions
to Kate's visual presentations have been enormous, since he was first
recruited to take his place with Stuart Avon Arnold as the dancers for
the Tour of Life in 1979.  His first video was . . . 'Them Heavy People,'
and he appeared in almost every video of Kate's since which required a
dance routine.  Indeed he can be seen in the clip for 'Love And Anger,'
his last contribution to Kate's work made only weeks before his untimely
death."

Kate might be considering doing some backing vocals on the next album
by Roy Harper.  "Kate last worked with Roy on his _Unknown Soldier_
album which was released in 1980.  It is reported that Paddy Bush is 
in any event designing the album cover."

Kate has been asked to appear at the bash at Wembley Stadium for
Nelson Mandela, but _HG_ felt it unlikely that she will appear,
"though it has not definitely been ruled out."

The British reviews of the L&amp;A single have on the whole not been
very good, especially considering the rapturous reviews the album
as a whole got.  The reviews of TWW were, on the other hand, very 
good.

In fact neither the second nor the third UK singles got much airplay.

Kate wants "Deeper Understanding" for the next UK single.

"Wuthering Heights" has appeared on three new British compilation albums!

Sales of the album are now over 300,000 in the UK.

"The 'Rock Circus' in London's Piccadilly Circus specialises in full-size
marionettes of famous rock stars that actually perform their most 
well-known numbers.  As yet, Kate has been spared, but she does appear
in the Beatles finale as one of the cut-outs in the Sergeant Pepper
montage."  [Could somebody in Britain tell me what the heck this means?]

"Columbia brought in Concrete Marketing to organise a nationwide
competition amongst record stores for the best promotional display.
Every store entering would receive Kate Bush T-shirts, and the 
competition winner is to receive a copy of John Carder Bush's
photo-biography _Cathy_.  The competition closed on [Feb. 28 '89]."
[So how come nobody on love-hounds has mentioned anything about
new Kate Bush T-shirts???]

"Ken" and "I'm Still Waiting" were the most requested songs on KROQ-FM
Los Angeles for the week of March 9-16.  [Does IED know about this?]

Radio Krakow [that's in Poland, for those of you who are geographically
illiterate] begun broadcasting on Feb. 1 a six part documentary entitled
_Kate Bush Unknown_.  The album is available in Poland only in hard
currency shops, presumably as an import.  The tracks are, however,
being widely aired on national radio.

Surprisingly, the album is not yet available in Bulgaria, home of
the Trio.  The state record label just released _Never For Ever_,
instead.  The only East European country where the album has been
released is Yugoslavia.

There's an article about someone who managed to get a ticket to
see Kate on Wogan.  I'm so jealous!  And, what does he say about
the performance?  "The rest many [sic] of you will have seen 
yourself.  Wasn't it just an absolutely fantastic performance?
So emotional and intense -- and it took several big gulps to choke
back the tears!"  Grrr.  We Americans HAVEN'T seen this yet!
