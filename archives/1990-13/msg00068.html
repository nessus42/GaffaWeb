The above list was taken from the handout distributed at the show.
They cut some of the videos/performances from some of the interview shows
if we had already seen the video once, so don't depend on the above list
for a complete listing as to what was shown on any of those shows.

I did catch a few KT symbols.  One in Army Dreamers and one in
The Big Sky.  I also think that there might be one in Suspended In Gaffa.
Anyone know of any others?  It was kind of hard to look for them, not being 
able to rewind and all (and I kept getting caught up in watching them!).  
I didn't even think to start looking until I saw the one in Army Dreamers 
(it was pretty obvious).
