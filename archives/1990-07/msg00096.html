	"Once more into the breach, my friends!  Once more!"
					- _Henry V_

	At this writing the 1990 net reader's music compilation tape
seems to be right on schedule.  I have received a half dozen tapes in
two months, which extrapolates somewhat naively to eighteen
submissions by June, which at five minutes per submission would fill a
90-minute compilation cassette.  Of course I realize that only the
Massachussetts Treasury would take solace in such a projection, so once
again let me encourage readers to dust off their tape decks and run me
off a cassette of at least one composition preferably under five
minutes' length which will be included on a non-profit mail-order
release during the summer.

	Each one of these postings generates a surprising volume of
mail for me, so let me apologize in advance for not being able to
answer everyone in depth, but not mean to dissuade anyone from writing
anyway, especially with questions about the project.

	I seem to be unable to remember to save a copy of any of these
postings, but this is probably an subconscious excuse to rewrite the
instructions every month, as I have done here:

	- To appear on the 1990 compilation music cassette, send me a
 cassette tape of any type with one or more selections.  Please
 include a paragraph about yourself and/or the music.

	 - If you want to include additional music or notes on the
 tape just for my edification, it would be welcome.  Simply indicate
 your choice of representative iof you have one.

	 - Your music should be original.  This is left for you to
 define.  Aztec Camera's version of "Jump" was original, if you want a
 subjective guideline, while White Lion's "Radar Love" wasn't.  Or was
 that Great White, or Whitesnake, or...  Your own compositions are preferable.

	 - Do not indulge in that favorite pastime of the previous
 decade: worrying about legal issues.  Using someone else's music or
 lyrics will not precipitate a lawsuit on an operation this small, and
 it is doubtful that Joan Jett will steal your song and make millions
 of dollars.  "All copyrights revert to the original artists" is the
 canonical disclaimer which will allow you to deal with it from your
 end if you so choose.

	  - In the name of the deity of your choice I implore you: Do
 NOT worry that your production facilities are inadequate!  Mike
 Gaines' basement four-tracks sound better than he realizes -- the
 content far overshadows any lack of engineering.

	 - Your tape is non-returnable.  No, I am not collecting free
 audio cassettes as some have humorously suggested; I am merely too
 busy.

	 - In June I will make a master compilation and a label and
 insert, and have them mass-produced by a professional (ahem) facility.
 A previous market survey and prevailing rates will determine the cost;
 I expect to lose a small amount of change on the endeavor, but that's
 nothing new to any musician.  People will be asked to order by sending
 me a check and a mailing address.  Orders will only be taken for a
 limited time then, since I cannot afford to overstock.

I am debating adding my own contribution, if I can figure out how to
mike the trumpet so it doesn't sound like Adrian Belew.

I may also include a four-color reprint of Doug Alan's Musical
Navigation Chart, a masterful work of Old World cartography which
depicts the world as bounded at the poles by Foetus and Madonna, and
stretching from Hank Williams at one end to Al Jourgensen at the other
(of course, on a globe these two are adjacent).  Deadly rapids and
doldrums which have destroyed others (Rush, Dire Straits) are clearly
marked for the seagoing sojourner.  I'm still trying to figure out
where Beethoven and the Ketjak are on here, but anyway, the address to
mail your tape to is:

Paul Boutin
Educational Initiatives
Project Athena
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
One Amherst Street
E40-300
Cambridge MA 02139

ps. If I get *one* piece of mail ranting about Knopfler or Peart, I'm
	punting the whole thing! :)
