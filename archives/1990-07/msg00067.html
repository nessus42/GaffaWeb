&gt; Oh, please!!!

&gt; Will you people PLEASE get off this masturbation kick?!?  I'm not
&gt; sure, and maybe KT hadn't gotten together with Del at the time she
&gt; wrote TKI, but I don't think she was THAT frustrated.

Hold on a minute.  I don't agree with this masturbation interpretation
of "The Man with the Child in his Eyes" either, but why would Kate
have to be "THAT frustrated" to masturbate or to write about it?  I
can guarantee you that many people who are not frustrated at all
masturbate, and it's a natural and healthy thing to do.  By the way,
Kate was only sixteen when "The Man with the Child in his Eyes" was
recorded, and she was as young as twelve when she wrote it.

"I had often strummed my penis, like some siff-necked lyre, as I lay
 in bed at night; it comforted me as I sailed off to Dreamland; but
 that night, in my thirteenth year, when my penis erupted like some
 semen-belching Vesuvius, I was thrown into a state of terror.  I
 thought it was blood spurting forth in hot gobs; I thought I was
 dying (and, even as I ran, screaming for my mother, I wondered how
 dying could feel so indescribably good)!  Luckily, Mother was fast
 asleep (or perhaps strumming her own lyre?) -- and Reason soon came
 awake, patiently explaining all that happened."
