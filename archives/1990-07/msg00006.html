                Eclectic Music Survey #4 Results

Survey Posting                                      February 1990

Part 14 of 19 (Thru William Orbit)


Monsoon

     See Sheila Chandra . . .
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

     Sheila Chandra and two British men who wrote the songs and played most
     of the instruments. The two men continued to write and play for Chandra
     through her four solo albums, so it doesn't seem that the band broke up,
     just changed its marketing strategy to push Chandra into the spotlight.
     Good tunes.
          - Ken Josenhans 13020KRJ@MSU.BitNet

Montreaux

     Yet another alias for the group consisting of Darol Anger, Mike
     Marshall, Barbara Higbie, Michael Manring and friends who record for
     Windham Hill. Mostly acoustic guitar, mandolin, and violin music, with
     an occasional bit of synth. If you like Montreaux(sp?), you'll probably
     like the albums _Chiaroscuro_ by Mike Marshall&amp;Darol Anger, and
     _Tideline_ by the Anger-Higbie Quintet. It's all the same group of
     musicians, recording under different names to confuse the heck out of
     the consumer.
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

Ronnie Montrose

     Buy the first album its IMMENSE. The rest are slightly less than
     inspiring.
          - Iain Smith &amp; Jonathan Habrovitsky
          jhabrovi%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     Some of his solo stuff might surprise you...
          - Russ Levreault RLEVREAULT@EAGLE.WESLEYAN.EDU

Monty Python

     Beats the heck out of me what they have to do with music (with a few
     occasional exceptions like "Sit on My Face" and "The Philosopher's
     Song"), but they're definitely the funniest group of comedians the world
     has ever seen. Makes you wonder how people could stand the drivel that
     passed for televised comedy in the B.C. (Before Cleese) era.
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     Great funny songs: Oh I am a lumberjack and I'm okay...
          - John Gateley gateley@m2.csc.ti.com

     is it possible my life changed, when I finally watched that show that
     everyone was giggling over in Spanish class in 11th grade? It must have
     now that I've hosted five Monty Python festival weekends! Say no more!
          - Paul Mount prm@whutt.att.com

     This band is dead!
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     _The Spam Song_ is surely an epochal work in twentieth centruy music.
          - Russ Levreault RLEVREAULT@EAGLE.WESLEYAN.EDU

Moody Blues

     Spiritual rock for contemplative people. Often soaring and beautiful,
     with lots of textures borrowed from classical music. Later incarnation
     not as much fun.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

     The first rock band to record an entire album with an orchestra. It was
     supposed to be a stereo demonstration record! Soon to be followed by
     Procol Harum, Deep Purple and Jesus Christ Superstar.
          - Paul Maclauchlan moore!paul@uunet.UU.NET

     They are supposed to be starting the Threshold label up again to gain
     further control of their albums.
          - Neil Ottenstein OTTEN@UMCINCOM.BitNet
James Moody

     smooth, cool west coast school saxman.
          - del Amitri del@ab.ecn.purdue.edu

Christy Moore/Paul Doran

     Moore was the original lead singer for Moving Hearts, an interesting but
     ultimately flawed Irish folk-rock band. Now he's back to solo work.
          - Ken Josenhans 13020KRJ@MSU.BitNet

Patrick Moraz

     Brilliant synthesizer player. Has performed with Refugee (formed by the
     members of the Nice who were left after Emerson split), Yes, and the
     Moody Blues, as well as doing solo work. Especially recommended from the
     solo albums is _i_, his first one (good luck finding it!), and _Flags_
     by Moraz and Bruford.
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     If you sift through his stuff there are some really good dance tunes to
     be had.
          - Russ Levreault RLEVREAULT@EAGLE.WESLEYAN.EDU

     Keyboardist for Yes for "Relayer", possibly also "Yesterdays"
          - Christopher Waldemar Bochna cb2w+@andrew.cmu.edu

Ennio Moricone

     One of the *all time* great s'track composers. ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE
     WEST is pure classic stuff . . .
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

     _The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly_
          - Russ Levreault RLEVREAULT@EAGLE.WESLEYAN.EDU

Georgio Moroder

     The man behind Eurodisco as well as Donna Summer. Svengali or
     benefactor? You decide.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU


Morrissy

     I hate his music. It jumps straight into the charts at a high position
     and falls straight back out again (the Bros syndrome). Self-pitying.
          - Stephen K Mulrine
          smulrine%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     Oh please can't somebody stop his endless whining ???
          - Hans Huttel  hans%lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     I liked him better with the Smiths.
          - Valerie valerie@athena.mit.edu

     Oh yeah, let's all wear black and listen to Morrissy and the Smiths and
     get depressed .... actually, I like his stuff now and then, but it's too
     into how terrible life is.
          - Bill White bwhite@oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu

     Pukey whiner.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

Steve Morse Band

     Good new age/rock hybrid.
          - Russ Levreault RLEVREAULT@EAGLE.WESLEYAN.EDU

     If this is the same Steve Morse who did "Highland Wedding," I think he
     may eventually become the best guitar player ever. A very wide range of
     styles and techniques.
          - Bill White bwhite@oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu

Mike Mothersbaugh
Bob Mould

     Much like Husker Du. His album _Workbook_ has a very informal feel to it
     which I like. Also a progressive artist.
          - Bill White bwhite@oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu


Muddy Waters

     An American classic. Until his boxed set was released last year, his
     music was always more available to European record buyers than those of
     us in North America. Why do US record companies treat the rock musical
     hertitage with such disdain and neglect?
          - Paul Maclauchlan moore!paul@uunet.UU.NET

     Another dinosaur from the early days of recording. Blues from the gut.
     Had his career resurrected by Johnny Winters a couple of years back.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

Mudhoney

     60's psychedelia meet's 80's punk!! to awesome and raw to pass over!!
     get it or regret it!! on SUB-POP (seattle label)
          - joel metz mantis@ucscb.UCSC.EDU

     Touch Me I'm Sick is one hell of a song !!!! Wow !
          - Hans Huttel  hans%lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

MX-80 Sound

     early punk from indianapolis, of all places. fairly rare. they also have
     some later cuts on ralph records.
          - del Amitri del@ab.ecn.purdue.edu

Michael Murray

     Perhaps the best organist going today. Get _The Great Organ at Metheun_
     and play it loud.
          - Russ Levreault RLEVREAULT@EAGLE.WESLEYAN.EDU

Youssou N'Dour &amp; Gabriel

     N'Dour is interesting when he's not bogged down in Europop stylings, as
     he was on most of the "Nelson Mandela" album. "Immigres", despite hiss
     and dropouts, is very good, apparently authentic mbalax -- supposedly
     that album was a big hit on cassette in Africa. I like what I've heard
     of "The Lion".
          - Ken Josenhans 13020KRJ@MSU.BitNet

R Carlos Nakai

     american indian flute player.
          - del Amitri del@ab.ecn.purdue.edu

NASA

     Saturn V was great, but Shuttle was just a flash in the pan.
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK



Negativland

     Do you know how many timezones there are in the Soviet Union?
          - Christopher Waldemar Bochna cb2w+@andrew.cmu.edu

     Mass media culture in a blender, cutting edge stuff and very cool.
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

Bill Nelson

     a sound composer. he experiments with themes but seldom writes complete
     songs based upon those themes. hence the albums are snippets of mood,
     but not quite new-agey. lots of CD re-issues out now.
          - del Amitri del@ab.ecn.purdue.edu

Neneh Cherry

     Bright and sassy rap that says "Up yours!" to machismo. A tad heavy on
     the electronic beat for my taste.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

     Don's daughter.Was at one time in both The Slits (from what I've heard)
     as well as the New Age Steppers(with whom she definitely recorded.)
          - Jon Kincaid dsrekjk@prism.gatech.edu

     More teeny-bopper crap. Proves the decline of society.
          - David Caldwell macs!dfc@bikini.cis.ufl.edu

     One of the best of the breed when it comes to the new wave of dance/pop
     babes (incl. Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson, et.al.) . . . very classy
     material all around
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

     She's boring now. Always the same music...
          - Hussein Yahia hussein@bora.inria.fr

Neuronium

     Spanish synth-playing duo, Michael Huygens and some other guy whose name
     I've forgotten. Never heard their music, but intend to one of these
     days.
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

New American Orchestra

     Fucked up BLADERUNNER soundtrack. Burn all copies and force Vangelis to
     release the real thing at gunpoint instead of throwing bones (THEMES).
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

New Birth

     funk vocalists.
          - del Amitri del@ab.ecn.purdue.edu

New Musik

     Probably the first successful British technopop (emphasis on pop) group.
     They released three albums. The first, 'From A To B' was probably the
     best, yielding the singles 'Living By Numbers' and 'World Of Water'. I
     believe Tony Mansfield (who was, basically, 90% of New Musik) went into
     production. Anyone know what happened to the rest of the group?
          - Alan Crawford awrc%lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

New Order

     getting better with time. Technique my favorite LP of 89 despite three
     mediocre songs towards the end (run, Mr. Disco and the next one) so many
     killer songs on it though. Plus True Faith makes me feel extraordinaary,
     leaves wierd images in my head from the video, was my favorite song of
     87.
          - Paul Mount prm@whutt.att.com

     "Fine Time" was an excellent single although some fans hated it. I wish
     they would do more stuff like this. Uhh...electronic.
          - Stephen K Mulrine
          smulrine%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     Like their synth work more than their noise. One of my favourites is the
     remix of 'True Faith' on the soundtrack of "Bright Lights, Big City".
          - Wingerde van FJ fjvwing@cs.vu.nl

     Only heard _Substance_ and selected others. Some of their stuff is very
     intense though I like that. I also can't ever understand their lyrics.
     I liked them better as Joy Division, though.
          - Bill White bwhite@oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu


Colin Newman

     vocalist for the band wire. guitars effected into nice things.
          - del Amitri del@ab.ecn.purdue.edu

Randy Newman

     A one-man ragtime revival. Writes deceptively simple piano songs that
     reveal an acid wit and razor teeth upon closer examination. Proved
     America was stupid as a brick by releasing "Short People" to an outraged
     populace of small individuals.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

     I really like his stuff a lot, and am suprised more people dont.
          - John Gateley gateley@m2.csc.ti.com

     Randy Newman is God. I love this man with all my heart, I really do. I'm
     not sure how to classify the music, though it's pretty "normal" stuff -
     mostly it is just songs accompanied primarily by piano, often with drum
     or guitar backup. His style is down-to-earth, simple, and honest without
     being folksy or touchy-feely. His personality shines through his work
     bright and clear. The two albums that I'm most familiar with, "Sail
     Away" and "Land of Dreams" are both wonderful. They always make me
     smile.
          - Garth Snyder garth@cs.swarthmore.edu

Niggers With Attitude

     I love their shocking Rap. And Eazy E is fantastic.
          - Hussein Yahia hussein@bora.inria.fr

     Never heard of them before, but I definitely like their name!
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     The crappiest of the crap. Worse than ADC.
          - David Caldwell macs!dfc@bikini.cis.ufl.edu

Nightnoise

     Gary Numan Did some interesting synth-pop in the early 80s. About the
     only song I can remember at the moment is "Cars", which was pretty good.
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

Nikki Sudden

     creation records has cornered the market on jangle-y guitar and drunken
     angst vocalists.
          - del Amitri del@ab.ecn.purdue.edu

Mojo Nixon

     Definitely a social commentator, best classified as progressive, for
     lack of something else. Can be extremely satirical and the satire might
     be overwhelming at times, but funny nonetheless.
          - Bill White bwhite@oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu

Klaus Nomi

     He wanted to be an opera star, but didn't *quite* have the talent; so
     after a stint as a backup singer for David Bowie, he recorded an album
     that is basically wierd rock songs with his operatic vocals. It's a very
     bizarre album; at times, you think that ol' Klaus has undergone a sex
     change operation. After that album, he disappeared and there was a rumor
     that he died.
          - Anton C Shepps (Tony)
          rochester!moscom!telesci!ashepps%ll-xn.UUCP@cs.wisc.edu

Peter Noone

     He'll always be Herman to me.
          - Paul Maclauchlan moore!paul@uunet.UU.NET

     See Herman's Hermits.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

Ken Nordine

     the man who did "word jazz" and wrangler jeans TV ads in the 7Ts.
          - del Amitri del@ab.ecn.purdue.edu

Gary Numan

     Cars is great technopop, don't know about the rest.
          - John Gateley gateley@m2.csc.ti.com

     Kraftwerk with a touch of humanity. Composed abstract/ futuristic tracks
     with compelling dance beats. Hung about with Robert Palmer for a while.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

     Made music like John Foxx..more successful though, but not as good IMHO.
          - Stephen K Mulrine
          smulrine%computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     Right out there on the edge of the new wave scene at the beginning, and
     a pretty solid artist all the way through to today. Like "Warriors",
     et.al.
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

Sinead O'Connor

     Eeeeeehhhhhmmmm.... nice try but not my cup of tea. Tries too hard to be
     new and far-out and agressive on her first album. Great cover of
     Prince's 'Nothing compares 2 U'.
          - Wingerde van FJ fjvwing@cs.vu.nl

     Excellent. What more can I say?
          - Valerie valerie@athena.mit.edu

     Great voice. When's the next album?
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu

     Great, almost enough to push KT out of her godhead.
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

Patrick O'Hearn

     Former keyboard player for Missing Persons and Zappa. His solo work,
     mostly solo synthesizer pieces, sounds nothing like his work with the
     aforementioned bands. His first album, _Ancient Dreams_, was probably
     his best; the second one was almost as good, but the 3rd one, _Rivers
     Gonna Rise_, I found too "commercial" for my tastes. Sounded too much
     like he was trying to make Generic Big-Selling Synth/NewAge Album
     #23943....
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     Good, although some people do this kind of music better (such as Lanz &amp;
     Speer).
          - Russ Levreault RLEVREAULT@EAGLE.WESLEYAN.EDU

Alexander O'Neal

     We want a new album!!!
          - Hussein Yahia hussein@bora.inria.fr

Gilbert O'Sullivan

     Two hit wonder with "Clare" and "Alone Again, Naturally". Out of the
     same stable as Tom Jones and Englebert Humperdinck.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

     go to when they grow up?
          - John Gateley gateley@m2.csc.ti.com

Philip Oakey &amp; Giorgio Moroder

     Their only album is Human League-ish, but with that distinct Moroder
     sound. Most people will have heard 'Together In Electric Dreams'.
     'Good-Bye Bad Times' is used as the theme music to the BBC Scotland
     political programme 'Left, Right &amp; Centre'.
          - Alan Crawford awrc%lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

The Ocean Blue
     American group in the style of their heroes in the British new music
     scene. Their songs are simple, but the inside story has it that Sire
     signed them and released their album with very little artist
     development; this first album suffers because they are novices. My
     opinion: they have the talent and ability to do much better, and they
     will go a long way with a little luck.
          - Anton C Shepps (Tony)
          rochester!moscom!telesci!ashepps%ll-xn.UUCP@cs.wisc.edu

     Opened for Tom Tom Club at Club Bene in June 1989. Nobody had heard of
     them yet. Wound up liking their album a lot more than first listen.
     Original impression: Morrissey collaborates with Crowded House.
          - Paul Mount prm@whutt.att.com

     What I've heard of them seems good and innovative. I'm waiting to see
     how/if their style changes.
          - Bill White bwhite@oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu

Oingo Boingo

     Do these people get on every movie soundtrack ever made, or what?
     Originally the "Knights of the Order of the Mystic Oingo Boingo" or
     something like that, headed by Danny's brother (?) until 1976 or so,
     when (I think) his brother got jailed for something. Made a truly
     bizarre and pretty lousy movie about themselves. Supposedly a musical.
          - Kevin Martin sigma@pawl.rpi.edu

Mike Oldfield

     Ah yes, Mike Oldfield, the talented multiinstrumentalist from Canterbury
     (originally in the Kevin Ayers band before going solo.) The one album I
     have, _Hergest Ridge_, I like a lot. From what I've heard, his later
     albums were not as interesting...
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     Composer and multi-instrumentalist of "Tubular Bells" fame.
          - sco!martyst@ucscc.UCSC.EDU

     My vote as the "rock" artist most likely to be remembered for his music
     in 100 years or so. _Taurus II_ is solid music. And now doing some very
     likeable pop.
          - Russ Levreault RLEVREAULT@EAGLE.WESLEYAN.EDU

     Ommadawn is the best. Avoid the horse song. People give you starnge
     looks if you sing the hornpipe.
          - Richard Caley rjc%cstr.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK

     One of the best prog/instrumental composers and bright young boys of the
     70s, turning pretty poppy of late but with a lot of spark still and an
     ear for who sounds best with the material. Lots of good stuff here, only
     album to avoid for newbies is probably ISLANDS and even that one isn't
     too painful for the completist to get. Faves: CRISES, DISCOVERY,
     INCANTATIONS.
          - Lazlo Nibble lazlo@ariel.unm.edu
Sally Oldfield

     Got "Strange Night in Berlin" on a whim, ready to hate it, and the first
     side blew me away. But "Celebrations" is the worst CD I own.
