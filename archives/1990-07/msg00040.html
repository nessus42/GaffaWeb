The following was included in the press kit for the album 
_Hounds_Of_Love_.




----------------------------------------------------------------



                         KATE BUSH

                       HOUNDS OF LOVE


Since the last album (THE DREAMING - released towards the
end of 1982) KATE BUSH has achieved the long-held ambition 
of designing, building, and equiping her own recording 
studio.  Upon its completion, six months of songwriting was 
followed by nearly a year of recording.  The result, the 
album - HOUNDS OF LOVE, shows KATE at a new creative peak 
both musically and lyrically.  It also displays her increasing 
prowess as a producer.

HOUNDS OF LOVE divides neatly into two seperate sections.
Side 1 comprises of five tracks including the first single - 
RUNNING UP THAT HILL (A DEAL WITH GOD) - a song about the 
fundamental differences between the sexes and how these 
differences lead to misunderstanding in relationships.  The 
four remaining songs touch on similarly universal themes 
matching music which surpasses even her previous standards 
of romance, rhythm and power.

Side 2 is equally dramatic.  It is a conceptual piece entitled 
THE NINTH WAVE.  The seven songs combine to tell the story 
of someone who has been alone in the water for some time and 
who is in danger of drowning.  His past, present and future 
manifest themselves in the struggle to keep him awake.

The abstract lyrical ideas perfectly complement the atmosphere 
evoked by the music.  In many ways this balance has always 
been inherent in KATE'S work and the signs can be traced back 
to her first album THE KICK INSIDE - which was released in 
1978, two years after she signed to EMI at the age of 16. 

That debut contained the atmosphere-laden WUTHERING HEIGHTS 
which introduced KATE to the world and which topped the 
singles chart for four weeks.  The hits continued with 
THE MAN WITH THE CHILD IN HIS EYES, HAMMER HORROR and 
WOW, the last two taken from the second album - LIONHEART.

The next project was KATE'S only tour to date but one which 
remains a milestone in the live presentation of popular music.  
A dazzling combination of music, theatre and dance, she was 
involved in every aspect of its elaborate staging from the 
choreography and costumes to the lighting and sound.

The single BREATHING (released in April, 1980) marked a dramatic 
departure from her previous material, one which was consolidated 
with the release of the album NEVER FOR EVER in the late summer.  
It crashed into the charts at No. 1 and spawned two further 
hit singles, BABOOSHKA and ARMY DREAMERS.

With NEVER FOR EVER, KATE was co-producing for the first time 
and by the next album, THE DREAMING (released in September 
1982), she had complete involvment in the production.  With 
the benefit of hindsight THE DREAMING can be seen as having 
set the scene for HOUNDS OF LOVE, both musically and from a 
production point of view.

With the accompanying promotional activities precluding the 
possibility of another tour in the immediate future, KATE is 
currently working on an idea to present Side 2 of HOUNDS OF 
LOVE through another medium to which she has already made 
a notable contribution - video.  This is planned as a visual 
interpretation of THE NINTH WAVE.

Before then, on September 16th, the HOUNDS OF LOVE will be 
unleashed in the UK on record, cassette and compact disc.
