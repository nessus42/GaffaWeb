&gt; Yo! MTARR@EAGLE.WESLEYAN.EDU raps:
Don't you think this is getting a bit old?  :)

&gt;&gt;Drukman, when I listen to TKI (well, not so much as "Lionheart"),
&gt;&gt;no matter *how* much I love the album, and I do very much, sometimes my throat
&gt;&gt;starts to hurt just listening to her.
&gt; 
&gt; Tarr, I don't understand you.  Are you implying that this is a BAD thing?

No, it's not necessarily bad... it's just something that the later albums don't
do to me, and when I listen to something, it should affect my ears and my mind
and my soul, not my tonsils, too!
  
&gt; I never said anything about her vocal prowess.  It started great and remains
&gt; pretty great...

Aw, come on, don't be afraid to use the superlatives!  They won't kill your
reputation.  It started great, and has gotten greater.  :)

&gt; If I'm blasting a Skinny
&gt; Puppy disc and someone comes in and says, "hey, does that singer have throat
&gt; cancer or what?" then I know that it's a good day.

Sorry, but Skinny Puppy gives me diarrhea.  I know our musical tastes diverge
at many points, just from reading a few of your recent postings.  But I'm a
purist who likes melody in her music- and anyone who knows me can attest that
the male voice in most of its incarnations does nothing for me anyway.  (Read
the above concerning tonsils.)
  
&gt; Meredith, Meredith, Meredith... it was a JOKE... they were FUNNING ON YA.
&gt; There was an alternate European ending, but it came at the end of the two
&gt; hour pilot movie and showed that Killer Bob had done it.  That was the only
&gt; variation.

Gee, thanks, Jon.  Now Klaus knows for SURE .gaffa was a spoiler!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
