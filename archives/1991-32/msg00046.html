Hi!

Well, it's nice to know I can still stir up a lively response.  :)

As for having taste... thanks for counting me in among the elite, Drukman!
;)

Okay, everyone seems to have their own (rather strong) opinions on this whole
TSW thing.  And to be honest, I think if KaTe really does lurk around once
in a while, she'll be glad to read these exchanges- we all know how she loves
"fan reaction"!

So, to restate My Humblest Of Humble Opinions:

Kate Bush has developed during the course of her albums.  Her voice has gotten
stronger and more controlled, and will continue to do so (we hope).  Her
talents in the studio have consistently been cultivated and proven in the
finished product (before you all hit the ceiling, I'm speaking in general
terms here).  Drukman, when I listen to TKI (well, not so much as "Lionheart"),
no matter *how* much I love the album, and I do very much, sometimes my throat
starts to hurt just listening to her.  Just the fact that she could progress
from the Cathy of "Wuthering Heights" to the woman who sings "Under The Ivy"
and "Reaching Out" should be a testament to her vocal greatness- some people
out there are just getting worse, or not changing at all.

And when I play TKI I invariably get a "Didn't that hurt?" from one or another
of my housemates or family members.  When I play TSW, I always get some form
of "Wow- who *is* that?"  That tells me all I need to know, folks!

(Re "Twin Peaks"- anybody know who did it in New England?  It's WEIRD that
there seems to be so many different endings... wouldn't that affect the writing
of the previous episodes?  Or should I just go over to rec.tv.tmin.peaks
(or whatever it is) and ask?)
