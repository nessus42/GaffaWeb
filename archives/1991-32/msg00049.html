Hi Everyone,

I received the latest issue of _Video_ yesterday, and found this review
of the _TWS_ release.  Page 60: 

Kate Bush:
The Whole Story

1985 comp. Digital stereo. 58 min. CLV 2 sides. $24.95. Pioneer Artists.

It's taken five years for this 13-song anthology to make it into Pioneer's
U.S. catalog. (The Japanese release has long been a choice import, even at
$100.)  But the wait is just about worth it. The images are wonderful-
Bush's mix of sensuality and surrealism is shown to great advantage, 
whether she's engaged in the exquisitely erotic dancing of "Running up
That Hill" or acting out the moody psychodrama of "Breathing."  And the 
color and sharpness are just about everything one could hope. 

The only problem is with the sound-the digital tracks are reasonably 
bright and sharp, but fall well short of the vibrancy of EMI Record's 
British CD of this same material.  According to Pioneer, the music was 
mastered from the video's analog music tracks, which would put it at least
two or three generations away from an original studio master.  A mild 
boost in volume-coupled with a few adjustments on an equalizer-can make 
up for this problem, but those with analog-only players should be warned 
that the analog music tracks are so soft, they're almost unusable. 

In any case, the disc is a dazzling showcase for Bush and her videos, 
which do comprise an important part of her work.  Since she's only
undertaken a single tour in her entire career, she puts more of herself 
into these video appearances than most of her peers.
