In article &lt;9109151746.AA20369@aristotle.ils.nwu.edu&gt; you write:
&gt;
&gt;I've been trying to remember the words to "Rocketman", and imagine
&gt;how Kate might have done it (how long ago did she record?).

She packed my bags last night,
pre-flight.
Zero hour, 9 a.m.
And I'm gonna by high as a kite by then.

I miss the earth so much,
I miss my wife.
It's lonely out in space.
On such a timeless flight.

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no:  I'm a rocketman.
Rocketman, burning off his fuse out here alone.

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise a kid
In fact it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them
If you did.

And all the science, I don't understand.
It's just my job five days a week.
A rocketman, rocketman.

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no:  I'm a rocketman.
Rocketman, burning off his fuse out here alone...
-----------------------


This has been one of my favorite songs for at least 10 years...and there are
very few songs that I was into as a 12 year old that still count as favorites.
I think one of the reasons I've always liked it so much is the way it 
captures--intentionally or not--the feel of many of Ray Bradbury's stories
concerning the 'rocketman' who did his job as if he were driving a truck or
working an assembly line..."It's just a job I do, five days a week."  It was
incredibly exciting to learn that KaTe would cover it for the Elton John
tribute album.

&gt;You'd think it'd be like Rocket's Tail, but aint-no-way... it's more
&gt;a simple piano-treatment kind of song, I expect.  Little Earth?

I think that for me, the song would work best in a style like "Under the Ivy,"
an intensely emotional, incredibly simple arrangement.  I can't wait to
hear it!

Jeff
