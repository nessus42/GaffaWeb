&gt;&gt; I too found "The Sensual World" to be an album not quite like the
&gt;&gt; others.  I like the lush orchestration, the Trio Bulgarka, etc.  What
&gt;&gt; I found weak was...Kate's voice.  It just seemed rather flat, without
&gt;&gt; the energy and spark of her earlier works.  I don't even like

&gt; As for her voice, well, yes, I don't think it's quite as good as on her 
&gt;previous albums. Just doesn't have a certain "quality" that made her 
&gt;sound so great on her other albums. Like on "Wuthering Heights," (both 
&gt;versions), for example. But the album IS growing on me. It just appeals 
&gt;to me in a different way than her others ones that I have.

I have to disagree. Her voice has definitely improved over the years.
She has gotten better voice control, as well has gaining the ability
to vary her singing for better expression. 

I think that HoL was a better album than TSW, but I think that HoL was
her best album singing wise. 

To slightly revive the "Catherine" debate, I think that it is pretty
silly to get upset to her changing her style in TSW. To me, it seems
that EVERY album has a different style or mood that is expressed.
TKI is one of adolescence and youthful wonderment. NfE is a darker
disturbing collection of mystery and abhorance to aspects of the
world. TD is described as surealistic, but "different" is the word
I think is more accurate. HoL is a bit more mainstream modern
rockish, TNW is a bit artsy and ominous. TSW is, well, pretty sensual.

I think there is more of a difference between L and TD, than HoL and
TSW. If TSW is "Catherine," then she was here a long time ago.
