Boris Chen inquires:
&gt; I saw the other day an album, The Kick Inside, but it had a different
&gt; cover. It is kinda in Japanese style writing, with KT on a Kite.
&gt; Different than the covers I have seen with a simple portrait of her
&gt; in jeans. I am wondering if this album is worth getting. And if it is
&gt; different than the regular one.

i *think* i spun the current thread of fave album covers by mentioning
this cover a week ago...  this is the original british cover to TKI -- the
album itself should be identical to the u.s. release with the Kountry-
KaTe-in-a-Box cover.  it is my never so humble opinion that this
cover is *stunning* -- and it's a great picture of KaTe!  there is a 
direct reference to the song "Kite", of course, but the image of KaTe 
flying up into the eye of some giant being really ties the album 
together for me -- so many of the songs are about KaTe discovering
and interacting with great, powerful forces, ideas, and gods...
the relatively pedestrian u.s. cover fooled me into listening
to the album as a set of relatively pedestrian pop songs at first --
the u.k. cover prepares one for something special...

&gt; Also, I saw a picutre album of KT, and I think it is of some interview
&gt; of her from 1987. The picture is of KT with a wicked smile holding a
&gt; bass. It is 22 bucks, and I am wondering if it is worth it.

it's worth it if you like the picture, or if you are interested in
KollecTing KaTe-stuff.  the interviews themselves are available in
transcribed form in The Garden and Cloudbusting -- often with notes
and corrections.  around boston, $22 is on the high side for such a disk,
though not unreasonably so...


footah!
