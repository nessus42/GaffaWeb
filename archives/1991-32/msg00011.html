&gt; I too found "The Sensual World" to be an album not quite like the
&gt; others.  I like the lush orchestration, the Trio Bulgarka, etc.  What
&gt; I found weak was...Kate's voice.  It just seemed rather flat, without
&gt; the energy and spark of her earlier works.  I don't even like
&gt; "Rocket's Tail", preferring "Never Be Mine".  I agree with others
&gt; that the sound quality was abysmal, especially for Kate.  Not to say
&gt; that it was a bad album, just one that should have been improved.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, when I heard the song "The Sensual World", it was very
&gt; promising, and led me to expect an album in that style.  The
&gt; disappointment that it really wasn't probably contributed to why I
&gt; don't hold the album so highly.
 
 Yes, TSW was also the first song I had heard from the album, and thought 
it to be quite promising.
 As for her voice, well, yes, I don't think it's quite as good as on her 
previous albums. Just doesn't have a certain "quality" that made her 
sound so great on her other albums. Like on "Wuthering Heights," (both 
versions), for example. But the album IS growing on me. It just appeals 
to me in a different way than her others ones that I have.

&gt; 				 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; I've heard rumours of an "Atlas Shrugged" movie being made.  Anyone
&gt; know anything?  Maybe Kate as Dagny?
 
 (Hey! Somebody who FINALLY recognized the quote! &lt;grin&gt; )
 The only thing that I know of is that there was a mini-series planned 
that didn't go through, as well as a movie that didn't go through. 
Hmmmm.. As I look through my biography here, I see some mention of a 
possible movie version (book's dated 1986). 
 Kate as Dagny? Hmmm.. Yes, I think I could see it! (Although, of course, 
I think &gt;I&lt; should get the part. :)
