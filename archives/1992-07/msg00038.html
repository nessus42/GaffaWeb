|&gt; (hey-y-y-y-y, Jessica!  I think *you're* king!!! ;^)

Actually, *I* think Melissa is king, but that's beside the point.
|&gt; 
|&gt; I mean this to be a conciliatory post... but I've got to risk some
|&gt; thin ice to try and clear up some anxieties about warmroom.  sorry
|&gt; if this sets off another round. (richard, thanks for the thoughtful
|&gt; post, btw.)

(Picture Jorn 'n' I shaking hands and air-kissing here)

|&gt; 
|&gt; First: I'd never dream of withholding hot news from rmg... not that
|&gt; i'm especially well-connected in that way.  All my tips have come
|&gt; from tom richards, and anybody can hear what he knows if they're
|&gt; willing to give at&amp;t a buck.  he's got *great* antennae.

I think if Ron Hill or Richard can get as much info about other
people as they can about Kate, they can easily get a job with the CIA.

|&gt; 
|&gt; i just want a place where i can write about kate and life, in my
|&gt; very own handcrafted precious peculiar manner, without feeling
|&gt; like i'm setting off alarumbells somewhere like Oshkosh...

That's how I percieve Gaffa (in these frustrating between-album times).
For wondering things like "How DOES Kate relate to toaster-ovens?"

|&gt; 
|&gt; I don't suppose we can ever know if I coulda been nicer about the
|&gt; divorce... but i'm willing to be nicer now.  Cynthia, Jon, Richard,
|&gt; Missy, Stev0, Larry: we're all in love with the same divinity...
|&gt; even if some of us have the illconsidered impression she might sometimes
|&gt; shit ;^).  I'm willing to try and take good care of you, like sisters
|&gt; and brothers should, if you'll return the favor?

Aye, Laddie. Kate Bush is God, and don't yer fergets it!

|&gt; 
|&gt; but i'm a ridiculously thinskinned guy.  if you think i don't *reel*
|&gt; at criticism, you should check it out with me.  i die daily, i really
|&gt; do, lately.  i think people *should* be extrasensitive. (nobody's
|&gt; claiming, are they?, that i'm *imagining* these slights... just that
|&gt; i'm overreacting... right?)

As for me, I'm on the other end of the spectrum.  I can not say "I
think 'The Dreaming' is a very fine album."  How it usually comes out
is something like "Anyone who doesn't think 'The Dreaming' is the best
fucking album of all-time should have their head crushed between two
large rocks!"

|&gt; 
|&gt; i'm still reading gaffa and ecto, but only when i'm prepared to give
|&gt; up the next four hours lying up, trying to shake off whatever darts
|&gt; have hit home.
|&gt; 
|&gt; hey, i been flamed on warmroom!  and i'm glad of it.  if people thought
|&gt; i was putting myself above criticism... think again.  i'm on the Fool's
|&gt; path, and nobody has to be afraid to flame the Fool.  But don't fucking
|&gt; flame me pointlessly when i'm trying to do something good... coz from
|&gt; time to time i travel the warrior's path, too. &gt;^(

Hmm.. maybe I SHOULD read WR... Nah, I get 100% of my minimum recommended
daily dosage of KaTeNeWS from Gaffa.

|&gt; 
|&gt; hardly anybody has started posting yet to warmroom, except me... and
|&gt; if it turns out just to be a mailing list of people who do like to read
|&gt; my writing-- that'd be less than i hoped, but still the best solution
|&gt; for me.

Maybe *I* should start a mailing list for those 2 or 3 folk out there 
who like reading MY drivel!  Naah, I'm usually too lazy even to
answer my own personal mail, never mind a mailing list...

|&gt; 
|&gt; i feel like it's a chance for me to explore the voice i was discovering
|&gt; in my "womanly hours" post.  i expect to start getting into some wild
|&gt; shit, about strange phenomena in the songs and in my own life as well.
|&gt; 
|&gt; You can now request a digest form instead of loose mail, if you prefer:
|&gt; warmroom-request@ils.nwu.edu
|&gt; 
|&gt; I'd sure like to hear about other lovehounds' wild shit... so long as
|&gt; it's mostly kind.

I think Lovehounds has, for the most part, "better" flame-wars than
any other group I know. (Read "better" as "kinder and gentler";  if
you want to see the REAL definition of nasty, try alt.flame;  those
folks are too much even for ME!)

|&gt; 
|&gt; is it really that arrogant for me to think i can judge what's unkind?
|&gt; if people really think so, let's talk it out in private email, to keep
|&gt; the hollering from breaking back out.
|&gt; 
|&gt; i think the signs of unkindness are pretty clear, though, usually:
|&gt; unconstructive abuse, personal innuendo, hurt feelings, stubborn
|&gt; refusal to apologize.  I think katefans ought to practice to be kind
|&gt; to each other's mistakes.  To the extent that she's our Joan of Arc,
|&gt; what else is the KT8 Army's mission?

My personal mission is to strap on the headphones, turn the stereo to
11, and blast "Get Out of My House".
