        I had the pleasure yesterday of meeting not one, not two, but three 
Kate Bush fans!  The "main" one being Jackie Zucconi, who was kind enough to 
let me borrow issues 5,6, and 7 of the old fanzine BREAKTHROUGH.  These 
issues contained not one, not two, but three "new" Kate interviews, as well 
as a Dave Gilmour interview.  These interviews are interesting in that they 
aren't included in my "needed" intervies list ('cause they're not in 
HOMEGROUND'S lists) and also because the interviewers were all very positive 
towards Kate and her music.  Also, Kate talks about quite a few things that 
she hasn't really talked about before.  Definately "B+" material!   Look for 
them at a Kate Bush computer net near you.

        People have been talking about favorite Kate photos.  To me the best 
photo ever is the first picture in the 1989 "Q" magazine article (with Kate 
kinda looking up at the camera).  It's got that "I'm still a fox, even 
sitting around at home" look.  Wooo....

        Talking to those three fans made me think of what Kate Bush stuff I 
would want to get, if I saw it for sale cheaply enough anywhere.  Maybe if 
we all post lists, we might get some trades going!  Here's my list:

Back issues of the KBC (and Homeground, and BREAKTHROUGH)
The Single File boxed set. 
The "Q" 1990 special (I have it transcribed, but those pics would be nice!) 
The 1980 "Biography" and "Princess of Suburbia" books (for the pictures, 
again!)
The boxed set
