&gt;      If you're so defensive of rights to express opinions, why are you so
&gt; hesitant to express your own?  I'd like to see them, really.  I would be
&gt; completely civil and myself if you spoke of Kate without what I might
&gt; interpret as insulting drivel.  Again, this does not mean you _have_ to
&gt; in order to please me, on the contrary.
 
Due to the attuitude of "justify yourself" that I sensed in
Peter's tone.  At least, it seems so.
It doesn't matter what you interpret Ken, insulting drivel or
otherwise.

&gt;      Hahahaha.  "feel free o email me."  You won't talk about Kate here,
&gt; but you will flame.  We're not looking for consistency with the flame war,
&gt; we're looking for consistent constructive Kate discussion.
 
Happy to talk about Kate when there's stuff to talk about.
Meantime, you seem to want to fan the flames.

&gt;    In other words, it is my own personal belief that you should take
&gt; the insults to personal mail (like I have with many people, and come to
&gt; an agreement very easily) and put your brain end in gaffa instead.
&gt;      You haven't justified yourself yet.  Why start now?
 
I have absolutely no need to "justify" myself.

I'm happy to take personal stuff to Email, though you seem
unable to do that.  You have purposely, it seems, kept your
Cynthia obsession in the public forum.  Fine.  Your choice.

&gt;      Some of those buttons weren't meant to be pushed.  Why don't you learn
&gt; what the buttons on a human psyche do (including your own) before you pass
&gt; judgement or go on a pressing spree.  You'll live a much longer, happier
&gt; life, IMESHO.
 
Thanks, but I'm well aware of my own buttons.  What I had no
idea of was how much you are affected by me.

     Not that you have to, but IMO your real self would come out a lot
&gt; better, much to our relief.  If you're the nice girl your friends claim
&gt; (which I believe completely,) why not show it off?  Why keep on with IMESHO
&gt; childish ridicule and toying?
 
You get Cynthia pretty much how she actually is on any given
subject.  SOmetimes that placid, sometimes it'll be a storm.
Tough  And for your sexist information, I'm _not_ a nice
_girl_, ok?  You can keep your macho condescensions.  I'm used
to all your other condescensons, but the macho sexist ones
really are out of date.

&gt;    I want Cynthia the person, not Cynthia the bitch.  Again, so you don't
&gt; hop on the same wagon, that's my personal opinion.  Your decision will have an
&gt; impact on what I think, but it is certainly entirely up to you.  I think that
&gt; latter part is what you hide behind, but never really have understood.
 
Thanks for thinking I'm really a sweet gal hiding behind the
facade of a "bitch" or a woman who gives her opinions any way
she sees fit (same as a bitch apparently).  You are wrong, but
ithat's no crime.  The one person I do understand after all
theres years, Sweetheart, is _me_.
Please don't try to second guess my own self-knowledge.  You
are out of your league.

&gt; &gt;essentially.  Um, I'm honored by your stooping so low, but um,
&gt; &gt;gee, for the foreseeable millenium, .. no thanks.
&gt; 
&gt;      Aren't they sooo condescending?
&gt;      If you saw condescension in an uncondescending post, do you think maybe
&gt; you have a reason to think that is true?  It was an offer of reconcliation.
&gt; If you have no intention of coming to an agreement or a compromise, stop the
&gt; charade that you want to.  You have no basis to insult a person because of a
&gt; completely home-made reason.  Oh, you have the right to, but you're only
&gt; deluding yourself.  I personally don't give a damn what you say if it's
&gt; insulting.  I may or may not be alone, but I don't think that's what you're
&gt; looking for.

Uh, huh.  Well, I was talking to Vickie but.... thanks for
your input.

Later,

Cynthia
