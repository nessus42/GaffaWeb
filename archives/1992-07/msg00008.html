DAVE GILMOUR INTERVIEW
----------------------
by Greg Torrington

FROM CHEZ FM 106 RADIO
FROM A REPRINT IN BREAKTHROUGH FIVE

        [Transcribed by Ron Hill.  Thanks to Jackie Zucconi for supplying me 
with this interview]

        CHEZ: I'd like to ask you about Kate Bush.  She is popular in very 
small pockets of North America - this being one of them.  I know that you 
had a lot involvement in starting her career off.  I would like to talk to 
you about the beginning of Kate Bush's career in regards to you.  How did 
you first meet her?

        DAVE: A friend of mine has a friend who told my friend that his 
sister was very talented.  This friend of mine came to me and said, "My 
friend has a very talented sister" and would I listen to her.  And I said 
"sure", so I listened to her.  I thought she was very good. 
        I did some recording at her house, her parent's house, and then I 
had her up to my studio and recorded some things.  I decided that the way 
she sang and played the piano, just on its own, was not going to be very 
effective for convincing A&amp;R men at record companies of her value.  So, I 
decided to pick some songs out of all the songs that she had and go in and 
record them properly in a recording studio with an engineer, a producer, an 
arranger and an orchestra.  I organized all that, chose some songs and 
recorded three tracks which I then played to the EMI people over here and 
they made a deal with her and signed her up.  It's quite simple.  The three 
tracks that I had recorded, I sold them to EMI as well, and two of them were 
on her first album.  One was "The Man With the Child in His Eyes" and one 
was called "The Saxophone Song".
        
        CHEZ: You are credited as the executive producer on these tracks.  
[Dave indicates affirmative].  What was the song that she played when you 
first heard her, when you first went to her house? 

        DAVE: I can't remember.  I know that one of the first songs that I 
noted was "The Man With the Child in His Eyes", our of many songs that she 
had written.  She was only 14, I think, when I met her, maybe just about 15. 


        CHEZ: Did you see that there was potential, commercial talent, or 
just artistic potential? 

        DAVE: I didn't realize how commercially successful she might be.  I 
thought of her more really, I suppose, in the terms of someone like Joni 
Mitchell; the level of a lady who's very talented, but would appeal to a 
more esoteric audience.  But she had different ideas.

        CHEZ: Well, this certainly came out in later years.  Are you still 
in touch with her or is it pretty much a fair accompli?

        DAVE: Well, my involvement with her career specifically stopped at 
the moment that I sold her on.  I retained a small financial percentage on 
the tracks that I did that were on the first album, and I got my expenses 
back out of EMI when I sold her on.  I sold the tapes to them for what it 
cost to put them together.  I haven't had any financial interest in her 
career. 

        CHEZ: Are you still friends?

        DAVE: Yes, I see her quite often.  I actually sang some backing 
vocals on her last album on a track called "Pull Out the Pin."
