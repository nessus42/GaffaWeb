&gt;  I have tried to send this by private email numerous times but it keeps
&gt; bouncing so...., sorry for all of you who I'm sure I'll offend, but I
&gt; really need to say this to clear my conscience. 
 
Other Love-Hounds reach me at my email address.  I don't know
why your mail bounced.  But unfortunately, whatever the reason
or excuse, your public post will receive a public reply.

&gt;       Cynthia Rosas:
&gt; 
&gt;          Grow up. Can you possibly ever post something about Kate or some
&gt; other intelligently related subject, as I thought was supposed to be the
&gt; purpose of this group, rather than constantly just pissing and moaning from
&gt; your own private pity-pot? I would like to think you (and a few others) are
&gt; mature, intelligent people with something worthwhile to say, but lately that
&gt; has not been the case. How 'bout proving to me and others that you still
&gt; have a Kate-related brain left?
 
Actually, I think I do and have posted about Kate related
subjects many times, as well as Kate unrelated subjects that
come up.  I think if you'll read the posts you'll see that I
actually did not start this latest round.  Ken Brownfield
started his long and winding road of critiqueing my technique
due to my support of a little silly mocking post Steve Verlin
made. Oops, that's Berlin.   Since he insisted on pursuing the
public forum, I responded there.  
Sorry if it's tedious for you, it is for me too.  Hopefully
Ken will tire of hearing himself drone.  Meantime, you'll just
have to scroll on past.

Secondly, I do not have to "prove" anything to you Judi, or
anyone else for that matter.  Following your message are two
more long winded posts by Ken.  I'm going to try and be brief
in my reply, cause he won't be happy till I act like his idea
of a "good girl", and that will most likely never happen.

But to you, and Ken and anyone, I say, thanks for your input,
however, I will say whatever I want about any subject raised
or hinted at in here, and I'll say what I think any way I see
fit.  You don't like that, then don't read it.

Sorry bout not being email, but you have to be a grownup
yourself.  Do you think you should hiss your little insults at
me in public, then tell me to answer privately, cause you
"meant" to hiss at me in private?  It doesn't work that way
Judi.

And basically, there is no "our bullshit".  You got your
response.  If you have anything else to say, feel free to
email me, or maybe try to get it to Richard Caldwell, maybe he
can forward it, or tell you what you may need to do to avoid a
"bounce."

Later,

Cynthia
