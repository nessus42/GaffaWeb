stev0@sti.COM (Steve Berlin) asks, ``wherefore WarmRoom''?
&gt;2)  Mailing lists are faster (albiet not quite as reliable as
&gt;    newsgroups)

They certainly are not.  It's just gaffa's weirdo implementation that makes
it slower.  On a newsgroup that is JUST a newsgroup, posting is just as fast
as mailing a letter directly (assuming you and your news feed are right on
the internet).  Of course, if you're going through some machines that sit
around and send out data in bursts, you're going to be slowed down, but
that's equally true of mail.  To sum it up, there's no prima facie reason
why a newsgroup must be slower than a mailing list.

&gt;4)  Just out of curiosity

I must admit the temptation is pretty strong, but I'm already on about six
gazillion mailing lists and one more appeals to me about as much as a root
canal.

&gt;4) 50% (including several who fall in 1 &amp; 2 - again, I would probably
&gt;   sign up for it, but I *enjoy* hearing opposing viewpoints.  It's
&gt;   a litle hobby of mine.  It's called thinking.  Y'know, that's
&gt;   why I like Kate in the first place - her music makes you THINK!)

Damn straight.

&gt;I know Lovehounds started as a mailing list, and
&gt;(like all good newsgroups) have had it's share of flame wars - have
&gt;any of the past flame wars ever resulted in a split like this?  Also,
&gt;not to re-kindle anything, but what were some of the worst flamewars
&gt;about (again, I ask only out of curiosity)

Yeah, this is a prime example of SSDD - same shit, different day.  Back in
1986 (or maybe early 87, he said, putting on his white beard and his most
cracked voice) we had a great war after some rude male guy got ticked off at
some highly sensitive female person and said that the best tactic was to
"stuff a gag in her mouth and set the bitch on fire."  She called his boss
at work and tried to get him into trouble, I think.  It all blew over, of
course, and neither of the participants are gaffans today.

There was an extended flamewar over whether or not The Dreaming was really
just an overproduced sack of wind.  The fellow claiming that eventually
admitted he'd only ever listened to it once or twice a while ago on a tinny
little speaker.  Oh, that was fun.  And it wasn't conducted in a `civilized,
polite' way either.  Insults were hurled, mud was flung, and feelings were
bruised until they were a mass of swollen black goo.  Ah, I must wipe a tear
from mine eye, recalling such a beautiful thing.

In the good old days, IED was a great deal more cantankerous than he's been
lately.  I confess, he scared the bejeezus out of me, to the point where I
feared to post an article lest he shred me in front of the entire world.
AND I THINK THINGS WERE BETTER THEN, YES I DO.  Fear and loathing in
love-hounds!  Gonzo journalism!  Take your opinions by the genitals and
choke 'em til they plead for mercy and promise to be good!  None of this
namby-pamby "let's all play nice" stuff.  To hell with that!  Make a
commitment to your principles and beliefs.  Don't be swayed by weaker
minds.  Fight to the death!  AIIIIIGGGGGHHHHHH!
