&gt; I just saw (and taped) an interesting thing. TNT is showing a lot of
&gt; things that aren't "important" enough for CBS, for instance, the
&gt; performances of the lower-ranked skaters. They just showed the men's
&gt; Short Program and Gilberto Giadona (?-I didn't see the name spelled, 
&gt; this is what it sounded like phoenetically) from Milan, Italy, just
&gt; skated his short program to the instrumental portions of Peter Gabriel's
&gt; "Rhythm of the Heat!!" He used the opening instrumental (complete with
&gt; what I am certain are Kate "ah ah" samples) and the ending manic drums
&gt; portion of the song. Good for him! 
 
That's really neat!  I'm gonna switch over to TNT for skating
I think.  My boyfriend and I have been shopping for a new car
all week, (yechhhhh), and staggering into the house and
blindly turning o CBS.  Did see some fella last night (after
Kurt Browning, I think he skated),  do his original program to
Stairway To Heaven.  Not the original version of course, but
the song remained the same, even as muzak.  Oooh, bad pun.

Yeah, I've been taping it too, did you watch the pairs?  Well,
lest I be chastized for using bandwidth space for non-Kate
talk, email me if you wanna dish about skating.  Not that I
mind being chastized (ask my boyfriend! ;-&gt; ), but I gotta go
now, anyways.

&gt; They said that Gilberto is coached by Carlo Fassi, so he's a serious
&gt; up and comer. Hopefully no one will talk him out of using such
&gt; interesting and alternative music in future performances. I'm curious
&gt; what music he'll use in his long program. I'll be taping!!
 
For those who don't know, and _might _ care, Carlo Fassi was
Peggy Flemings coach years ago, among many others since, but
Peggy, umm, I mean, Fleming was probably his greatest claim to
notoriety.
It's interesting to see what music choices they all make.  It
seems often the Russians, or now, the Unified team, choose
AMerican music, while the Americans choose classical pieces.
Oh, not as a rule, but I think the Europeans use American
music more than the Americans do, anyway.  
My suspiciosn is that Gilberto will choose something a bit
more judge-pleasing for his freestyle long program.  Some
classical piece... then again, surprise is what makes it all
so delightful.  Enjoy, I'll be watching and taping, too!
Now, I really gotta goooooooo....Have a nice weekend.
We're still car shopping.  CAr salesmane can be such whores.
Hate it.

Later,

Cynthia
