&gt;Really-From: katefans@world.std.com (Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City)
&gt;
&gt;   A postscript from Chris. [...]
&gt;My first post was a flame of Jon Drukman, but
&gt;Drukman apparently needs regular flame-broiling to maintain his youthful
&gt;vigor.

You should learn whether the people you are flambeeing are likely to
get ticked off.  I seem to recall your initial scalding of me
including something to the effect of "most kate fans are quiet gentle
people who don't take kindly to your cynical tongue, boyo."  It
appears that some of us could do to practice what we preach.

&gt; The weird part is, Julian didn't say anything about the subject matter of
&gt;the post itself! To comment _only_ about a postscript on an otherwise well-
&gt;intentioned article seems a little petty. To react in the way he did seems
&gt;even more so.

Well, the subject matter of the post itself had very little to do with
the postscript, which seemed to be directed right at Julian, unlike
the main body of the post.  I don't think he was being petty at all.

Having met Julian on several occasions, both Kate-related and
otherwise, I may say that he is a very nice guy and he was perfectly
justified in getting miffed.

Here's what you said, a long time ago, Mr. Williams:

&gt;I've met a lot of Kate fans and generally they've been friendly introverts.
&gt;I don't think many of these people could respond to Drukman with the proper
&gt;level of vitriol necessary. Any hateful messages directed to me by Drukman
&gt;will be ignored. If he'd like to act like a civilized human being, we could
&gt;I'll say no more, for now, on the subject of Drukman. I intend for
&gt;future postings to much more constructive.

If Julian is still listening - don't leave yet!
