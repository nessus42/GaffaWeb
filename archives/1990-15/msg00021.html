Greetings...

God, I'm really on a roll this week, aren't I?

&gt; IED doesn't appreciate
&gt; being dismissed as one among some huge anonymous group which you
&gt; refer to as "men who want their meat lean and tender". It's an
&gt; insulting generalization. Not only are there a very large number
&gt; of _women_ who share "men"'s aesthetics of female pulchritude,
&gt; but there are certainly a great many men who do _not_ share them.

I wasn't trying to single you out as One Among All Men, IED- I was just trying
to say, admittedly quite badly, that I think the reason KaTe is so anal about
her appearance is that she thinks she positively has to be, or she'll lose some
of her following. 

&gt;    Also, IED would like to point out that Kate herself is not
&gt; entirely guiltless in this matter. For at least the last seven years,
&gt; and arguably since 1978, she has had great, and possibly total, control
&gt; over the official EMI-UK imagery which is used to promote the sale of her
&gt; records. Yet even in the most recent promotional posters and cover
&gt; designs she has seen to it that great pains were taken to touch up the
&gt; photos of her face and body such that she would look "her best". Special
&gt; care has always been taken by Kate, her brother John, and whoever he
&gt; gets to do the touch-up work after he takes his photographs, to
&gt; soften Kate's jawline, the flesh beneath her chin, and the lines
&gt; beneath her eyes. This is a fact which IED, at least, cannot conveniently
&gt; blame on "men who want their meat lean and tender". It is Kate's
&gt; doing, and although IED is sure there is some pressure from her
&gt; record company about the promotional images used to sell her
&gt; records, he is equally sure that Kate has sufficient influence
&gt; to see that they release only those images which she herself approves.
&gt; She is therefore at least partly responsible for the continued
&gt; promotion of an illusory image of Kate Bush the Celebrity,

This just proves my point: throughout the history of Western society people have
been forced to internalize the notion that outward appearance is everything-
men as well as women.  We do it totally unconsciously; hell, I don't like going
to the beach and seeing elephantile women waddling around in bikinis either. 
My point is this: people _do_ care about KaTe's looks, and obviously she does
herself- she has a vested interest in it, for the simple reason that a large
part of her fame has hinged on her beauty.  I think this is sad: people should
like her for her music first, because if she herself wanted to be famous only
for her appearance, she could've become a model.  And wouldn't the world be a
sadder, quieter place for it?

&gt; and as
&gt; such IED doesn't think it's completely unreasonable of him to take
&gt; that aspect of her work into account--at least in some small
&gt; measure--when he enjoys or analyzes it.

It's not unreasonable for you to take that into account at all- I'm just saying
it's rather a shame that we do have to do so.

Now that I've *completely* painted myself into a corner...
