I haven't seen The Young Ones in years, but recent posts have dislodged
memories of late nights watching the Young Ones and videos from Much
Music on a friend's satellite dish.  So:

Is anyone showing TYO in the Boston area? (or on cable -- I seem to 
remember MTV showing episodes at midnight or something)

There was an episode in which one of our heros (Vyvyan?) is attacking
the landlord, and one of the others (Neal?) asking why he is *funny word*ing
the landlord, and Vyvyan says "I'm not, I'm *funny word*ing Kate Bush;  I'm
just using [the landlord] as a condom.  Or something like that.  Anyway, I 
spit my ginger ale all over the couch.  SO, which episode was that?  Is it
(or any others) out on video cassette?

Speaking of obscure KT references, a bit of Wuthering Heights "plays" in 
a scene in Love and Rockets (NOT the group, but the wonderful comic book
from which the group stole the name).  I'm afraid it's not a very
positive reference, but then again it's not a very positive character
responding to it...  The series is written and drawn by Gilbert and Jaime
Hernandez, published (in comic book and graphic novel forms) by Fantagraphic
Books in black and white, and follows the adventures of many wonderful
characters, including a (mostly) female punk group, a stubbornly independent
woman writer, the world's richest man, and the inhabitants of a small Mexican
village.  Anyone interested in independently produced artistic works about
women, music, and the wonderful diversity of human experience (that is, any
fan of KT) ought to enjoy these books...  (I can't remember which episode
the reference to KaTe occurs in; you'll just have to buy the complete
set...  8-)    )

Right then.

Footah!
