&gt; Really-From: JONES%RPIECS.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu
&gt; 
&gt;   As a reply to your inquiry regarding my KT video...yes, it DOES
&gt; include the "December Will Be Magic Again" video, with Kate curled
&gt; up in the oversized wicker chair in her foxy red snuggies.  (*grin*)

Indeed!  Does anyone out there know what this clip was taken from?
Unfortunately, there are a lot of clips like this one whose origin
can't be identified from the tape.  

Have a look at the top left hand portion of your picture.  If your
copy is like mine you can see the edge of the TV screen that this 
video was apparently taped from.

&gt; The tape
&gt; also includes the video for "Delius", but (if you ask ME), it's much
&gt; more than a short clip...the video continues for most of the song.

&lt;blush&gt; You're right.  After I mentioned it I had to go watch it again
and it really is most of the song, all but the beginning and end.

&gt; And I'm not ashamed to tell you that I was absolutely SPELLBOUND watching it.
&gt; The sight of Kate, with that white gown all floating and gauzy around her,
&gt; was breathtaking.  Perhaps the lovliest I'VE ever seen her...

I have to agree, Babooshka is right up there for sex appeal but for pure 
grace and beauty I think this may take the title.   &lt;note for
the "Her looks don't matter, dammit" crowd: this video clearly shows
how Kate can use her own physical grace an beauty to suppliment the
beauty of her art _when_she_so_choses.  There is _nothing_ wrong with
that, dammit!  {no offense intended to anyone :-) }&gt; 

So does anyone know if this video is obtainable in it's entirety?
In the talk show segment that followed (with Kate and Eric Fenby) the
host mentioned a movie that perhaps inspired the writing of the song, 
"Delius" but the title wasn't clear, does anyone know what it is?

&gt;   To the rest of you who asked for a complete list of the video clips,
&gt; I'll work on getting that to Love-Hounds in the near future.

That'd be nice, I could use an index to this tape!  :)

Another item on the tape: A dissappointing performance of "There Goes
A Tenner" from (I think) Top of the Pops.  To me the performance
("miming" the song to a dance routine with two partners in crime)
looked pretty rough.  No wonder that single didn't do well. :)
