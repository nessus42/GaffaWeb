   [much of IED's completely reasonable remarks deleted]

&gt;&gt; Could not the weight gain have _something_ to do with this increasingly
&gt;&gt; anti-social behavior, or could not the behavior have had something
&gt;&gt; to do with the weight gain? IED can even conceive of the possibility
&gt;&gt; that such a change in body-type might, at least in some degree, reflect
&gt;&gt; or even partially influence, an artist's stylistic development (or
&gt;&gt; lack of same). These are questions which even the most serious-minded
&gt;&gt; and dediKated fan might reasonably ask, in IED's opinion, as long as
&gt;&gt; they aren't allowed to assume an exaggerated importance.

&gt; I DON'T GIVE A FLYING F*** HOW MUCH CHOCOLATE SHE EATS, HOW MUCH CARROT CAKE
&gt; SHE DEVOURS ON A DAILY BASIS, AND HOW MUCH SHE WEIGHS!!!
&gt;
&gt; I *would* like to see her dancing more, but she did quite a bit of it in her
&gt; TWS and L&amp;A videos, so she hasn't stopped completely.  

Quite a bit of dancing in _Love and Anger_?  Moving to the music to
some, flailing about to others, but not much dancing.  Still, if you'd
like to see her dancing more, you _must_ care how much she weighs.
She will never be able express her art _freely_ through dance if she
is not in at least in reasonably good shape.  Wouldn't you care if she
got to the point where her wieght or condition made a performance like 
that of _RUTH_ or _Hammer Horror_ impossible for her even if _she_ felt
that it was the right way to express her music visually?

&gt; This whole niggling debate about her appearance and how it affects people's
&gt; liking or disliking of her music really pisses me off, and it always has. 

I don't think that anyone here has argued that Kate's wieght has any
bearing on her music, we're talking about her position as a multi-media
artist here, we're talking about her artistic options, we're talking
about the size of the pallette that she will have at her disposal.  To
me, anything that limits her ability to do just exactly what is right
for her art at any given moment is undesirable. 

Even beyond considerations of how her physical condition affects her
art there is absolutely nothing wrong with appreciating Kate's
physical beauty as long as you accept her as a person and not an
object.   It really doesn't have anything to do with her music but
then I don't think anyone has claimed that it does (note the
distinction between physical condition and physical appearance).
