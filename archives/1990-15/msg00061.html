Hullo,

I've picked up quite a few things in the past couple of weeks...all of it
pretty good suprisingly (or not in some cases).  I think the best of the 
new lot are the KaTe singles I found a recent record convention.  They are
the Canadian? (EMI-America/EMI-Canada) 12"s of "The Hounds of Love" and 
"The Big Sky (Meteorological mix)"

The Hounds disc has B-sides: Burning Bridge and My Lagan Love
I like the Burning Bridge quite a bit some of the vocal energy of Ken
and the music is similar to one of the new B-sides (BeKind or I'm still
Waiting, I've not listened to 'em for a while so I'm not sure).  Well 
worth the $$ (4.00 to be exact).  Lagan is similar to Handsome Cabin Boy
'cept there is no drone tone, just kate singing.
My UK copy of HoL12" has the B-sides: Handsome Cabin Boy and Jig of life
So how many different singles had different B-sides across the ocean?

The Big Sky is awesome (it is already one of my faves) 7:44 minutes!!!
It is not quite as driving all the way through as the album version is
but it is still cool.  Who is doing the voices when they start going:
"That cloud looks like ______" and what is  "Cobulus Castellus" (Sp?)
as in "That cloud looks like cobulus castellus."

the B-sides are: Not this Time, which is a nice mellower song with lots
of droning organ (a sound that kate doesn't usually use so much).  The
other B is The Morning Fog.

I also found a copy of the Art Bear's _Winter Songs_ for $1.00.  I like
it, it's kind of early/mid King Crimson meet punk.  Anyone have the lyrics?
Oh BTW who sings for them and what else is out there by them.

Other recent buys include:
Fish: _Gentlemen's Excuse Me_ 12" the B-side is a very unfish like, but
	really cool blues tune.

Marillion: _Easter_ 12": Easter is my fave off the new one, the Bside was
	rehashed Marillion fodder, unfortunately forgettable (IMHO).

Arson Garden: _Under Towers_ (see earlier Post)

Caterwaul: _Beholden_ hmm...Gothic Folk??? Do they have anything else out 
	there?

Oingo Boingo: Alive

Sinead O' Connor: Bothe of 'em...haven't really had a chance to absorb
a lot of this stuff I may post more later (the bulk of which will go to
music.misc, unless someone brings up a give group here)

And oh I picked up Dax's _Dark Adapted Eye_ good stuff the closest to
	Dance music I've come to yet.  I like her voice..I think..still
	need more time to absorb it.

till next time...
