We saw her in concert last week, and it was _wonderful_. If you like
Sinead at all, I tihnk you'd very much enjoy her concert. Here is an
account of the show that we saw that I sent to the sinead mailing
list: It's relatively detailed, if you don't want anything to be
given away, save it and don't read it until after you see her. (not
that anytihng is that important I guess, but I think I'd rather not
neccessarily know what the show is like, personally)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sinead performed at the Beacon Theatre in New York last night.
(And we were there!! :)

The Beacon Theatre is quite a nice place to see a show.  It looks like
the lower balcony seats are by far the best in the house, though
because it is a relatively small theatre, any seat at all is not bad.
We speak from absolute experience because our seats were in the very
second to last row in the upper balcony and they were somewhat over to
the right. The view was quite good though - we could see everything,
the angle wasn't bad, and we weren't _that_ far away.  (not like
seeing someone at Giant Stadium at all)

I didn't quite catch the name of the opening band. I assume it is the
      (I can't seem to find the articles that were sent documenting
      other recent shows.  I thought I had saved at least one, could
      someone please mail one to me, if anyone has it? I'd very much
      appreciate it.)
the same band that has been opening for her so far on this tour. They
didn't have the sound mixed very well, so the drums were a bit too
loud and the vocals weren't nearly loud enough, so we couldn't under-
stand a word that was said or sung. However, they could have been worse.
In particular, I thought their second to last song was rather good.

There was over 30 minutes between the opening band and Sinead's
performace. We were getting restless. But finally the curtain opened:
Sinead was in front center of course, the band was set back, as in the
other shows. Drums in the center, a keyboardist on either side, and a
guitarist in front of each keyboardist. 

She was wearing black pants, a black bikers jacket, and a black cap.
As in the other shows that have been mentioned here, she started with
"Feel So Different" She stood relatively still but used a lot of hand
movement. Someone had mentioned that they thought she was directing
the sound people. That's _possible_, but I tried to watch carefully, I
tihnk she has a basic instinct to direct the band, and she is half
doing that and half just doing something expressive with her hands.
Also, she didn't do it throughout the entire show, as someone said
about another show. 

The lighting was very pretty - there was a huge screen hung behind the
band, and three tall thin screens hung on either side. The colors and
patterns and movement of the lights always complemented the music well. 

In the middle of "Feel So Different", she threw the black cap to the
ground, exposing her head. She looked quite wonderful, I wish we could
have been closer.

Before the next song, she went offstage to get her guitar, and took
off the leather jacket. She was wearing a white and black bustier with
tiny straps. She did "The Emporer's New Clothes" and jumped around the
stage quite a bit during this one.

Then she did "I Want Your Hands On Me". She ran her hands up and down
and all over her body quite a bit - it was quite sensual. 

Fourth was "You Cause As Much Sorrow".
Fifth: "Three Babies"
Sixth: "Black Boys on Mopeds"

I liked all three of those better live than I had from the album. I think 
they were a little stronger live.

Then she did "Jackie". Only her and her acoustic guitar, unlike the
album, and it was quite good.

Eighth she did "Stretched on Your Grave". She had this one on tape,
like at the other concerts. It was strange at first, but since the
band was not ever the focus of attention anyway, and Sinead was
obviously very comfortable with the tape, it quickly became comfortable 
for me too, and she performed it wonderfully.

Ninth was "The Last Day of Our Aquaintance"

Tenth: "Nothing Compares 2 U"

Eleventh: "Jump in the River" She had pictures on the screen behind
her during this one, but there is a rack of lights above the stage,
and (this was the only problem caused by our location) it was very
hard to tell what they were of. She sang "did it so hard". 

Twelvth was "Jerusalem" and this was very impressive. So much energy
and very powerful. There was at least one picture with this song.

Thirteenth and last was "Mandinka". Strong but not as great as 
"Jerusalem", I felt.

She did "Troy" for the encore. Wow. 
At the end of Troy, she did not repeat "you're still a
liar, you're still a liar". She simply said "You're still a fucking liar".

So she did everything from the new album except "I Do Not Want What I
Haven't Got". And from the first album, she did all but "Just Like U
Said it would B", "Never Get Old". "Drink Before the War", and "Just
Call Me Joe". I wish she had done "Just like U Said it would B", in
fact I tihnk she ought to have done that song and one the others as a
second encore. But I'm not complaining, it was definitely an amazing
performance. 

Now, if we could just get Kate to tour!!!!!!
