&gt; "Big Hollow Man" was indeed a "dance club" hit.  I played it for a
&gt; friend from Alabama who had no idea what the song was or who it was
&gt; by, but she recognized it right off and said that she heard it all the
&gt; time in the dance clubs in Alabama.  IF it made it down there, you can
&gt; bet it made it elsewhere.

I am glad to hear that. I've only ever been in a "disco" twice in my life
so what whould I know? I shouldn't have said that without knowing for sure.

&gt; For interested parties - particularly Chris &amp; Vickie - there is an
&gt; interview with Mary Coughlan in the latest issue of Q magazine.

Yay! Thanks! When we were in Chicago I found a copy of an Irish magazine
called Hot Press. Not only is there a great article about her but she's
also on the cover. I scoured but wasn't able to find her other albums :-(

&gt; Oh Deb!
&gt; I've had these things on tape for quite a while...
&gt;&gt; The final KT item which I found was a new VIDEO (yes, you heard me right)
&gt;&gt; called _Kate Bush: The Collection_.  The cover is black and has a 
&gt;&gt; head-and-shoulders shot of Kate in her Wuthering Heights white gown. 
&gt;&gt; What this tape consists of is any and possibly every TV show clip that
&gt;&gt; Kate ever appeared on, including the old SNL with Eric Idle introducing
&gt;&gt; her.  A lot of the
...
&gt; I attribute my collection of Kate TV clips to the efforts of Chris 'n'
&gt; Vickie, perhaps "The Collection" has the same roots? I'd be interested in
&gt; a list of clips (and I'll make a list from my tape) for comparison.
&gt; Any comments from Vickie and/or Chris?

Yes. That collection did not come from us. First, it's definitely
a bootleg, not any kind of official release. We used to make dubs of our
stuff (that's how Maitland got his, sort of) and they've been copied and
re-copied Kate knows how many times. Since our originals way back then
were fairly atrocious, I can't imagine what they'd look like dubbed down
even more. Deb didn't specify that the one she got were particularly bad
quality. I'd be interested in a track listing also. Does it have Chris'
"Infant Kiss" video on it? One thing's for sure, if it did come (indirectly)
from us, I want the world to know that we NEVER intended the dubs to be sold
for profit. We quit making dubs a long time ago because it was taking over
our lives and when we couldn't meet obligations we left other katefans
mad at us. I never want to get back into that ratrace again. I'm glad you
found it Deb but I'm sorry you had to pay for it. We always worried about
that happening. Though it was only a few days ago I've already lost your
original post about it. I'll look for it and try to comment on some of the
clips. Were the clips named? For instance, the one where Kate's sitting
with a group of children is called "Razmatazz". The vergetarian show (where
Kate shows off some of her favorite dishes) is called "Delia Smith's
Cookery Course". 

This reminds me of a post I meant to comment on not too long ago.

Someone (really nice I'm sure) commented on and posted the address of:

The Intergalactic Garage-a treasurehouse of Kateware.

I'm not going to tell anyone they should not buy anything from this place
but I think a few facts should be brought out so katefans will have more
information on which to base their decision to buy.

The guy who runs IG is *not* interested in Kate Bush or her music in any
way, shape or form. You'd think anyone that offers that much Kateware just
has to be a fan but it's not true in this case. Way back, during the
"Break-Through" era, the IG guy realized that katefans were completeists.
He's smart and he realized that katefans and their money are soon parted.
He put a blitz of ads in Goldmine asking for Kate Bush items, anything and
everything wanted. He scarfed up nearly every Kate item in the country,
not owned by a fan. He's been selling that stuff back to fans ever since.
Sometimes at inflated prices, sometimes not. He's doing a good deed in one
way. He took things from people who were not interested in Kate and became
a clearinghouse for those things to go to people who really want them.
That's cool, but I have 2 problems with him personally. First, he doesn't
like Kate Bush fans. He told a friend of ours that he thought Kate Bush fans
are "weird". Are we? Some people think so, the subject could be worthy
(or not) of an entire post by itself. But this guy believes it and at the
same time he's making all kinds of money from us. Whenever I picture this
guy I conjure up a man with a fistful of money in one hand, a Kate poster
in the other and a big sneer of his face. Second, he had asked a friend of
ours for a rare video that the friend owned. Friend had the only copy of
it in the world (in the hands of a fan) and the IG guy knew he had it and
wanted a copy. Friend said no because he had asked John Bush if it was
alright to give out copies and John Bush said "no". End of discussion.
IG guy pushed. He wanted a copy. Hell, we ALL wanted a copy but the 
difference is that IG guy would SELL copies as soon as he got it. Friend
couldn't be blamed for keeping the video close, he had asked JB and had
been instructed. No, and that's all there was to it. Well, IG guy got all
pissy and wrote a tirade against friend in his catalog. In his CATALOG!!
IG NAMED friend!! In his CATALOG!! Printed up and sent to people all over
the world!! IG accused friend of being "selfish" and all kinds of other
stupid things that I don't remember and don't want to remember.
Also, friend had interviewed Kate and put her on the cover of a throwaway
music magazine. For a long time friend offered these giveaway magazines
to katefans for just the price of postage. He never sold one, though I'm
sure there were plenty of fans willing to pay for them. IG guy somehow
got hold of a bunch and is now selling them for $15.00!! 

Just thought everyone should know what kind of person you're dealing with
when you buy something from Intergalactic Garage.
