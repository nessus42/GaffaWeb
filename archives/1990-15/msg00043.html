Hello there fellow Love-Hounds--
  Here I am to throw in my two cents' worth about Kate's "putting on
weight".  Basically, all I can say is:  Leave the poor woman be!  If
she puts on a little weight, so what?  It's pretty much a fact of life
that your metabolism slows down as you get older, and if Kate isn't as
involved with dance as she used to be, she's bound to put on a little
weight. And personally, I don't know as I'd WANT her to stay as rail-
thin as she was in her younger days (you can practically count her
ribs in the Babooshka video, and several males have commented to me that
they found her too thin...)  Anyway.  As far as wrinkles go, I HOPE she
has a wrinkle or two here or there!  I mean, I'm pushing the big 3-oh
myself, and I'm starting to develop crow's feet, and have a gray hair
here or there.  And I'm probably about 10-15 pounds heavier than I was
when I was 18.  Do you think I look at myself in the mirror every morning
and say "Holy Christ, I've gone to hell in a handbasket?"  Not me!  To
me (as some others of you have pointed out), what a person is like on
the INSIDE is what makes them beautiful.  If I feel happy with myself,
I actually FEEL beautiful.  It's what you carry around inside you that
radiates your beauty on the outside, regardless of age.  So if Kate
gets those happy little laugh lines around her eyes, or gets a blush
in those slightly chubby cheeks, so much the better.  She's still our
Kate.  And to me, she's just as beautiful as ever.  What say we just love
her and leave her be?  Okay?

                                             All the best,
                                                  Deb Wentorf
