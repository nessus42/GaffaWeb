X-VMS-News: eagle.wesleyan.edu rec.music.gaffa:3650

&gt; I picked up an unlabelled picture disc at Vinyl Villains in Edinburgh
&gt; the other day. The guy at the shop didn't know what was on it apart from
&gt; the fact that it was a bootleg. When I got it home I found out it was
&gt; a dub of the BBC Kate Special. OK so I didn't really expect anything I
&gt; hadn't heard before but it's nice to dream, right? There is no cover, just
&gt; a piece of transparent plastic but the picture is very nice - same on
&gt; both sides by the way. It's a close up of her face, quite rare these
&gt; days although it's a publicity shot from the HOL period (I believe).
&gt; She wears an embroidered hat at an angle. Is it a pill-box hat or
&gt; something like that? Her hair's been stuffed inside the hat (very nice -
&gt; and Vickie, she hasn't cut it). 
&gt; So, is this old news or have I found something new? There are absolutely
&gt; no inscriptions on the disc at all.

Greetings...

Thank you for letting me finally know what's on that disc!!!  I was rummaging
around in an awesome record store in Amherst a couple months ago, and my friend
showed me that disc, as well as the Hammersmith bootleg I already own (got it
for $10 from some guy selling bootlegs in our Campus Center last year, what
luck!).  I didn't have the money to pay for it, but as I now have a copy of the
BBC special ( :) ) it's a good thing I didn't kill myself over not getting it! 
I've a feeling it's not new, but it's certainly not common.

I've GOT to learn to bring money with me when I go into that place.  The last
time I was there, I came upon a Japanese live double-album for $25, and it was
either borrow money from my friend and take the bus back to Wes, thus leaving
me in debt, which I hate to do to myself, or not buy it and be financially
happy back at school but feeling deprived.  I opted for the deprived, which
shows you my mental capacity...

I can't remember the name of the store, but if you're ever in Amherst, it's the
one a couple doors down from Panda East Restaurant and Bart's Ice Cream- it's
got really cool posters in the windows, and an AWESOME import section (compared
to what I'm used to, that is).
