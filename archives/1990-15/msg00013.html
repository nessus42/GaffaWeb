&gt;Really-From: katefans@world.std.com (Chris'n'Vickie of Kansas City)

&gt;Danielle Dax-I don't know a whole lot about her. She's been around for years
&gt;and used to be with a band called The Lemon Kittens. She's sung back-up for
&gt;various people (one song on Robert Fripp's "The League Of Gentlemen", she
&gt;also drew the cover of that album). She's also acted and was in the film
&gt;"The Company Of Wolves" (only a bit part).
&gt;
&gt;As a solo artist she has tons of 12"s and an album called "Inky Bloaters".
&gt;But there is a compilation album out (in America) called "Dark Adapted Eye"
&gt;and you should get that because it has most of the 12" stuff also.
&gt;We also have a Japanese CD with 16 other songs, all of which were too weird
&gt;to put on DAE. That CD is called "Up Amongst The Golden Spires". It says on
&gt;the front: Featuring tracks from the albums "Pop-Eyes" and "Jesus Egg That
&gt;Wept". I don't have either one of those albums, but there are tracks on this
&gt;CD that appeared on an album (well, EP) called "The Janice Long Sessions".

Vickie vickie vickie - how come you don't check your facts?  There are
in fact *three* songs from your _Spires_ CD on Dark Adapted Eye.  One
of these is "Hammerheads" whicih features the rhythm track from The
Dreaming sped up.  Incidentally, _Spires_ contains *all* of _Pop_Eyes_
and _Jesus_Egg_That_Wept_, although the tracks are in a mixed up order
from the vinyl.  There is also a Japanese CD called
_The_Chemical_Wedding_ which features a few oddities, including a
version of "Cat House" that has never appeared elsewhere.  It also has
a few of the 12" b-sides that aren't available on CD elsewhere (like
"Muzzles," one of my personal favorites.)

The Janice Long Sessions are live-in-studio versions of the album
tracks.

One final note: Dark Adapted Eye is indeed great but I must *insist*
that if you buy it, you get the cassette or CD - these formats have
NINE more songs than the vinyl.

I would not classify her as "intelligent dance."  Some of her stuff
has a strong dance beat, but mostly she does some high voltage rock
and roll with weird edges.  Then again, she does get played in the
clubs...

&gt;have your toes tapping. She's never had a "Dance Club" hit (at least not in
&gt;America, I don't know about England) because she's just too weird. Her voice
&gt;is versitile and she can do some amazing things with it. 

"Big Hollow Man" was indeed a "dance club" hit.  I played it for a
friend from Alabama who had no idea what the song was or who it was
by, but she recognized it right off and said that she heard it all the
time in the dance clubs in Alabama.  IF it made it down there, you can
bet it made it elsewhere.

&gt;All in all, I really love the album "Dark Adapted Eye" and I got it on CD
&gt;and was very glad I did. If you can't find it (though you shouldn't have
&gt;a problem, it's on Sire Records) then "Inky Bloaters" is worth having, though
&gt;I think it's only available as an import. She's weird and wild and crazy
&gt;and fun and not for the faint of heart. 

Inky Bloaters is indeed import-only.  The other thing to bear in mind
is that Dark Adapted Eye contains all but one of the tracks from Inky
Bloaters.
