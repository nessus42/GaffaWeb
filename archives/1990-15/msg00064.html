Chris here.

Drukman quoted me:
&gt;&gt; The weird part is, Julian didn't say anything about the subject matter of
&gt;&gt;the post itself! To comment _only_ about a postscript on an otherwise well-
&gt;&gt;intentioned article seems a little petty. To react in the way he did seems
&gt;&gt;even more so.

Drukman replied:

&gt;You should learn whether the people you are flambeeing are likely to
&gt;get ticked off. 

&gt;Well, the subject matter of the post itself had very little to do with
&gt;the postscript, which seemed to be directed right at Julian, unlike
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   
&gt;the main body of the post.  I don't think he was being petty at all.
&gt;Having met Julian on several occasions, both Kate-related and
&gt;otherwise, I may say that he is a very nice guy and he was perfectly
&gt;justified in getting miffed.

  WHAT?!?!?

  In _no_ way shape or form was my postscript "directed right at Julian"
or at anyone else for that matter! It was intended  _only_ as an innocent
mention of our status. I swear to Kate that I haven't the faintest idea what
you are typing about. Did Julian ask about our relationship? If so, I didn't
notice. Honestly. I added the postscript only because we _have_ received
letters from love-hounds asking "are you both girls, or is Chris a guy?"
(A reasonable enough question, given the fact that I was named after my
Aunt Chris, and had an older sister named Christina.) Nothing else was
intended, implied, impuned or inferred. This has gone on so long and so
pointlessly that I am having some difficulty remembering Julian's first
reply to my message. In self-defence I have included Julian's original
post, with apoligies to anyone still reading for wasting bandwidth...
(Mr. Drukman must still be reading, fine-toothed comb in hand...)

&gt; Chris (the _other_ one of Vickie'n'Chris)

Okay, I knew there was some sort of hidden agenda
hierarchy here. So much for this egalitarian byline nonsense.
(IT'S SOME SORT OF COSMIC OXYMORON, I do believe.)

&gt; P.S. Just a reminder to anyone just tuning in; She's a she and I'm a he;

Good idea! Capsule bios of contributors, inserted at random!
I'm male; I haven't been fixed yet. I'm 26; this accounts
for my perpetual mid-life crisis. I'm about 180 cm tall,
weigh 42 kg and have dark hair and blue-grey eyes.
Interested? Replies to this e-mail box, svp.

&gt;      We met through a mutual intrest in Kate 8 years ago and have been

Hey, what happened to the other 'e' in interest, there, other one?

&gt;     inseperable ever since.

O never mind, there it is!

Julian

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Drukman, re-reading this I have to ask; at what point was he was
"..perfectly justified in getting miffed."? His post was pointless
niggling, and deserved nothing less than "piss off! :-)". By the way,
it was Vickie who told Julian to "piss off! :-)". This is one of the
problems of posting as a corporate entity; confusion about who said what.
Vickie meant it in as friendly a way as possible, under the circumstances.
In addition to poking at me, he took Vickie to task (in his own charming
way) for mis-use of the word "oxymoron". Sorry, but that was very petty.
It would be comparable to questioning his use of "O" rather than "Oh".
Julian would be a better target of your sage, if rarely self-heeded,
advice quoted below.

&gt; You should learn whether the people you are flambeeing are likely to
&gt; get ticked off. (copyright 1990 Zik-Zak corp.)

  This is the last I have to say on this pointless subject. If Julian
wishes to leave because he cannot take as good as he gives, so be it.
There is a limit to one's responsiblity for other's actions. That limit
has been passed. Meredith, don't worry, you are a reasonable person
among unreasonable people.

   "SHUT UP or PISS OFF"
   "Well really, Vivian!"
   "No, those are two of the names I'm considering. Y'know, really good
    for getting into fights..."       THE YOUNG ONES
