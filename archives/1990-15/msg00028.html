Vickie here. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;Also, was it my imagination, or had she put on some weight?

 &gt;&gt; She likes chocolate. So what? Why ask? Does it matter? Does it affect
 &gt;&gt; her music? Does it affect her lyrics? Does it affect her musicianship?
 &gt;&gt; Does it make you feel any differently toward her? WHO CARES!!??!!!!??!!!
 &gt;&gt; This theme seems to keep cropping up and I just don't understand why.
 &gt;&gt; Why is it important enough to you to post about it?
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;-- Vickie

&gt;     As much as IED would like to agree with you, Vickie, that Kate's
&gt; appearance is of no concern (or should be of no concern) to her fans,
&gt; he cannot. And he thinks that you are yourself being possibly just
&gt; a little ingenuous--IED recalls more than one occasion on which you
&gt; yourself expressed admiration for Kate's beauty, which shows that you
&gt; are not entirely indifferent to appearances. Certainly IED can't
&gt; claim to be completely impervious to the power of superficial
&gt; appearances. He is a human being, living in the late 20th century, and
&gt; as such he has been hopelessly brainwashed into paying heed to this
&gt; sort of thing, whether he likes himself for doing so or not.

How can anyone NOT be totally blown away by Kate's extraordainary beauty?
Of course I say something every now and then. The thing is though, a lot
of it comes from make-up and photography. The Visual Documentary is proof
enough that Kate can look just like a regular person, there are even very
goofy photos of her in there. In everyday life Kate is interesting-looking
and good-looking. The ONE thing that adds that extra touch of lovelyness
to Kate's looks, no matter if she's Made-Up like a Chrismas Tree or walking
around with no makeup at all, is:

                Her *** INNER *** Beauty

One person might say "I don't think I'd like Kate as much if she wasn't so
beautiful" and that's their problem.

I say "I know I wouldn't like Kate as much if she wasn't such a kind, decent,
caring, sensitive human being".

There you have it. I know you think she's beautiful, of course you do. No
one with eyes to see could argue the point. OK, they could but we wouldn't
pay any attention, right? :-) But the music is most important to you, right?
Of course it is. Meredith had the right idea. Someday Kate will be old and
grey, someday she'll be dust and bones, but her music will live on forever
and 100 years down the road some Katefan won't give a damn what she looked
like. They'll have photos from all phases of her career and ages so the
trauma of her growing older (a major concern of this newsgroup, it seems)
will not be important. They'll be able to appreciate the music without any
of that garbage roaming around their minds. 

This is directed to whomever it might apply: People get older. It's a fact
of life. Appearances change as people get older. There are things such as
wrinkles that tend to appear. Gray hair happens. All you 21-year old
college boys with faces as smooth as a baby's butt who feel you have some
sort of right to criticize Kate's looks, weight, whatever, should face up
to the fact that PEOPLE GET OLDER.  IT'S A FACT OF LIFE.
Multi-zillion dollars a year get spent on cosmetics and weight-loss programs
and plastic surgery because it's people like you that perpetuate the idea
that aging is bad, aging is ugly, aging is uncool, unhip, unsightly.

She's only in her early 30s for christsakes! What in the world will you
be saying about her when she's 40 or 50 or 60? Give her a break!

Her music will live forever and her inner beauty will shine just as brightly
at 80 as it did at 10 or 20 or 30. IT'S A FACT OF LIFE!!

If you can't handle a few wrinkles, I suggest you go buy a Kylie record
and stare at the cover for a few weeks or however long it takes for you
to get whatever is wrong with you out of your system. Then put the album
on and start listening. My guess is that you'll come running "back" to Kate
faster than you can say "bimbo puppet pop tart" and not care in the least
if Kate weighed 300 pounds and was so ugly she scares the ducks out of the
water! 

In an interview at age 21, Kate was asked "What will Kate Bush be like at
31?" and she replied "I don't know. A few more wrinkles, I imagine. I hope
they're happy ones".

Yes, they're happy ones.
