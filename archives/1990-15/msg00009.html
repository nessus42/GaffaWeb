Hullo,

I went on a record expedition yesterday and found _Under Towers_ for
$7.00 (in a used bin) so I couldn't resist.  I like it a lot, though
some of it tends to sound the same, of course I've only listened to 
it 3 times (including right now).  I'm not sure how to describe the
music, it's very accessible though.  Some of the guitar rythms sound
like Queensriche (sp) but with folky guitars (as far as I can remeber
what Queensriche sounds like, I've only heard a couple of times). It
is not industrial sounding, I guess it sounds a little REMish, but more
adventuresome.  Good solid drumming, reminds me of Bill Bruford, keeps
the beat but there is always this little thing going on over here...no
over there.  The vocalist (I don't have her name right now) sounds kind
of like a cross between Maire Ni Bhraonain of Clannad and Natalie 
Merchant of 10,000 Maniacs.  Most of the Natalie comes from the way she
sings not her voice, her voice sounds like Maire.  Actually as I listen
it also reminds me of Grace Slick a little.  I highly recommend this disc.

Someone else pointed out that they thought it sounded a bit 10,000 
Maniacish.  Well there is in fact a connection...Albert Garzon produced
_Under Towers_ he's the guy that engineered (and maybe produced, I'll
have to check) 10k's _Secrets of the I-Ching_.  He also re-released
I-Ching without the Maniacs permission, they sued him.  I happend to
be lucky enough to find one of the reissues in Boston a couple of X-mases
ago, it has some gems on it.  Does anyone have acopy of _Human Conflict
No. 5_ that they'd be willing to tape for me?? I've been looking for
about 2 years with no luck.  I would of course do a copy of _i-Ching_
for you.

till next time...c-ya
