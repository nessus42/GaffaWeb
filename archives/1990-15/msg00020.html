This sounds exactly like a tape that a long time KT fan and quietly
listening Love-Hound (who will remain anonymous unless he cares to 
speak up) sent me a few months ago.  He says he got it from a guy in 
Canada a few years ago so I guess it's been floating around a while 
and has finally found it's way into the hands of bootleggers.  Does 
this include the performance of "Chrismas Will Be Magic Again" done 
in a wicker chair?   Certainly the most sensual Christmas video ever 
aired :-).  Another favorite is just a very small clip of some sort 
of video of "Delius" evidently shown during a talk show.  Kate is 
dancing in a white swan-like outfit, is there a complete video of 
this somewhere?  And of course, the entire Kate Bush TV special....
Wow.

&gt; Unfortunately,
&gt; there are some bits which have less-than-terrific quality, but being PAL
&gt; converted, what do you expect?  

My friend said (and I think he's right) that much of this video was "PAL
converted" by video taping the image on a TV screen.  The results are
certainly watchable but almost surreal at times.

&gt;   The tape was $25.  It may sound like a lot, but to someone like me, who
&gt; lives far enough out in the sticks so as not to enjoy the comforts of MTV
&gt; and VH-1, etc., this was well owrth the investment to see Kate in other
&gt; visual settings other than in her videos (wonderful as those are!)  If you
&gt; can find this tape, I strongly recommend it!

While I hate to see bootleggers making a profit off this sort of stuff
I certainly would have paid $25 dollars for it (ahem...forget I said
that :) ).  Some of this stuff is priceless.  I feel like I missed so 
much during my pre-enlightened days and this sort of helps me feel at 
least a little caught up.

Speaking of bootleg videos I have to say thanks to whoever (I think it
was Ed Suranyi) posted the information on _The Singles [sic] File_.  I
got it from the same place (they where out of the Live video) and I
got a very similar letter as well...I guess I too must of sounded
"enthusiastic" :-).  

The question came up as to whether this is a legitimate release or a
bootleg.  I have to say that I strongly suspect that this is a
bootleg.  The packaging is the sort of thing you could get done in any
big city inside a few days, the videocassette itself has no copyright
information on it's label (every other pre-recorded video that I have
seen does) which is a plain white sticker with the title, the quality
of the video is no better than a copy a friend made from laserdisc and
the audio is definately not as good, and of course the title is wrong.

On the other hand it does claim on the outside of the case the the
video is "licensed exclusively to Cello Video, Inc." for whatever that's
worth.  If this _is_ legit, someone should be ashamed for licensing
this to such a cheap outfit.

Still, it's well worth it just for the videos not found on _The Whole
Story_.  

Which brings me to the video for _Suspended In Gaffa_.  Oh my God.
I didn't think it would be possible to make a video that could capture
the spirit of that song but somehow she did it.  I think this must
be the ultimate development of Kate's early dance/mime/theater style
even as it shows the early stages of her later, more filmic style.  

By the way, our host has been up and down like the Assyrian
empire for the last week so if anyone commented on my annotations to 
_Saxophone Song_ I missed it.  If not...well I'll post them one more
time before declaring them officially done.  Maybe I need to make these
things more contraversial, I'm obviously not offending the right
people. :-)
