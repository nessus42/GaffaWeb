This whole debate has been nauseating.

Julian, (and you know that I consider you a friend, so don't get
hypersensitive on me, it's not worth the effort) you were being
nitpicky.  Also, while Meredith certainly was a bit overzealous in
telling you off, I sure got a chuckle out of the succinctness of
the aforementioned note.  I mean, you have to bear in mind
that a lot of people on this list have *never* met face-to-face,
and consequently don't have a good idea of how to "read" (pun intended)
each other - not that this is easy without all the visual/audio cues
even when you know the person, but without them it's damn-near
impossible.

Now, you must admit, had I told you to piss off you would have noticed
that you had a bit of a case of PMS (Pre-Missing Sinead) and taken
it in stride because you know me personally.

Further, this childish bid for attention ("Take me off the list") is
far beneath you.  Next time try, "I am dying, Egypt."  or "I am in love
with Egypt."

Meredith.  Bravo for refusing to deal with macho male-chauvanist pig
jerks.  However, Julian isn't one in real life, so don't get too bent
over him.

Chris'N'Vickie.  Y'all are too cool most of the time, but don't forget
every so often you're dealing with people ten years younger than you,
replete with emerging personalities and neuroses that are not fully
developed yet.  Obnoxious as |&gt;rukman may be now, remember that it
will take him *years* to become the complete asshole that is his
destiny (Hi, Jon!  Oh, by the way, Piss off ;-) ).

Jon.  Is your finger on that 'f' key?  Shame on you.  Unless you roast
my ass good.

Now, can we *please* stop being so fucking obsequious???  I much prefer
everyone being cranky - people are so boring when they're bending over
backwards apologizing to each other - they're much more interesting
bending each other forward and reaming them.
