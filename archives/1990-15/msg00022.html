&gt; At first I thought you were talking about Amherst, NY or something,
&gt; but you're definitely describing Amherst Mass.  And you didn't stop in
&gt; and visit while you were in town!  Some nerve.

Sorry!!!  I was only there for about 48 hours, to see the Primitives and
Sugarcubes at UMass and rent the TWS video and see _Diva_ for the first time 
and get up at 4:30 AM to catch a 7 AM flight from Bradley home to Florida for 
Spring Break. I hardly had enough time to see my best friend, and I was staying
at her house!!!  :)

&gt; The store in question is Al-Bums and it totally sucks.  They have got
&gt; some bootleg albums, and they have a nice bootleg Wuthering Heights
&gt; poster as well for cheap, but other than that, feh!

Sorry again, but I'm originally from Maine.  Maine-iacs are either Deadheads (I
went to an EXTREMELY Greatfully-Deadicated high school) or Iron
Maiden-worshippers.  I judge a record store's worth by whether or not it's
possible to order a KT disc from their catalog- and believe me, Florida's not
much better (I don't live near a big cultural center; I'm sure Miami might have
something, but it's a bit of a hike).

&gt; The store y'all wanna visit if you're in Western Mass is Main Street
&gt; Records in Northampton, just a short hop down Route 9.  They have lots
&gt; more Kate stuff, including all the import CD singles you could ever
&gt; want.  Not to mention videos, books, maybe posters...  

Somebody already e-mailed me about that place- thanks for the info!!!  I'll be
sure to check it out the next time I'm in the area...
