&gt; All in all I would have to say I was turned off by the whole mess.
&gt; Her voice was annoying as hell in the Wuthering Heights and Army
&gt; Dreamers ( though I did like the effect with her eyes ) videos.  I
&gt; found nearly all of the videos to be plain boring.  I can't
&gt; understand why she has such a large cult following.  She isn't even
&gt; good looking.  Everyone says what a great dancer she is, buy I
&gt; thought she looked like a cross between clumsy and ridiculous.

If you are turned off by an "annoying" voice then you miss the whole
purpose of Kate's music and are a fucking wimp.  Regarding her videos,
most of the ones you criticize were made in in the late 70's.  Why
don't you check out some other videos made in the late 70's (not that
there were many)?  Almost all of them are pretty lame compared to
today's production standards.

Also, perhaps Kate doesn't design her videos for the typical MTV
audience, which apparently has an attention span of about two seconds.
I also truly doubt that Kate's following depends on her videos.  Did
you ever stop to think that it might have something to do with her
records?  No, I guess not.

Who says Kate is such a "great dancer"?  I certainly have never heard
anyone say that, and I have talked to a *lot* of people about Kate
Bush.  In trems of formal dance technique, Kate is mediocre at best.
She only had a couple years of training, but who gives a shit.  This
isn't a ballet.  What a lot of people will say is that her
choreography and movement is ingenious and moving.  Other people
disagree.

And finally, regarding Kate Bush's looks -- this comment sort of
typifies your lame-brained reasoning.  Who gives a shit what she looks
like!  I don't listen to her because she looks good.  I couldn't care
less if she looked liked a hypopotomous in heat.  The fact that I and
others think that she is pleasing to the eye is just a bit of icing on
the cake.
