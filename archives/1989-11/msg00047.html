I think everyone's getting too caught up in all this tape copying nonsense.
The ONLY argument that I can see that should prevent this tape copying from
happening is the "Kate would be unhappy about it" argument. I don't see any
LEGAL problems with it. It may be illegal, but eveyone's getting out of hand
with their arguments. I keep hearing how it's wrong because the record
companies are losing $1 billion per year, and we'd be stealing from them,
etc. But THESE SONGS HAVE NEVER BEEN RELEASED, and probably WON'T EVER BE
RELEASED, so I don't see how ANYONE can lose money by us doing this. So
stop with the "ripping off the artists and record companies" arguments
already, OK? I mean, I __REALLY__ want this tape, and am getting a little
worried that it won't be coming. I think this is a much more LEGAL copying
than the _obsKuriTies_I_ tape, which contained many B-Sides that WERE
copyrighted and released. But I loved getting them, of course, because the
legal versions are unavailable to me. The only single I've ever found was
_Experiment_IV_ which I bought. And if I find the others I'll buy them.
Just as, if I DON'T get a copy of IED's tape in the mail in a couple weeks,
and I find someone selling the real bootlegged demo albums for $15 each or
something, I'll buy them, and unhappily support the bootleggers.
   So as far as I see it, Kate is the only thing standing between me and
those 17 unheard songs. And I certainly agree with |&gt;oug that IED was a
bit foolish to send off a letter to Kate explaining what he was doing, and
effectively, asking permission. My suggestion to IED: If you don't hear
by July 2, do the copying. I'll just pray Kate is not reading her mail for
a couple weeks :-). If I were her, I'd ignore the letter. I really don't
think IED will get a reply. But if he does, I can guess what it'll say :-(
