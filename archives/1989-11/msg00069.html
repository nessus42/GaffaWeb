&gt; What I'd like to know is where these tapes came from?  I mean in the
&gt; beginning.  How many tapes were originally made, one for KT, one for
&gt; Dave Gilmour, ones for who else?  How did the original bootlegger come
&gt; across this?  At the EMI vaults?  I'm curious to know the chronology
&gt; of a bootleg tape like this.  Any example would be appreciated, even
&gt; if it does not involve KT.

Rumor says that when Kate was just a wee girl (actually an early
teenager), she recorded many of her songs (not in a fancy studio or
anything -- just with whatever equipment her family had lying around)
and sent tapes off to many a record company.  At this time, none the
record comapnies showed any interest, saying that her music was marose
and uncommercial.  It has always seemed to me likely that some day or
another, one of these tapes might show up.  It seems likely to me now
that the tape that has surfaced is one of these early, amateur demo
tapes.

&gt; After reading the nth letter on this subject, I had a brainstorm.
&gt; Why don't we include some extra cash for KB herself, say an extra
&gt; $3.50 to make the cost an even $10.  That way, we'd get our tapes,
&gt; Kate would get paid, and I'd venture that %35 is more than she makes
&gt; on her regular album sales anyway.  The only people who would lose
&gt; are the lower-than-lawyer bootleggers.  Yeah, I know, there are one
&gt; thousand reasons why this scheme won't work.  Just an idea.

I guarantee you that Kate gives not a hoot about the money.  What she
does care about is that she doesn't want anyone to hear this early
material.  Sending her a few bucks isn't going to change her mind
about this.

&gt; Yes, precisely like IED's letter to me.  Mine was a straight parody
&gt; of his style, right down to inappropriate pronouns, overblown
&gt; modifiers, exagerrated analogies, specious transcendentalism, and
&gt; tangled sentence structures.  Sorry that your grasp of English prose
&gt; styling wasn't up to the challenge.

Your parody of IED falls kind of flat because his overblown style is
purposely already a parody.  He self-admitedly is writing in a
pseudo-Reichian style to poke fun at himself.  It's awfully
difficult to parody and parody....
