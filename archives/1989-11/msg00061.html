<PRE>

I will preface this by saying that I was out of town for a week, and someone
managed to "c" the gaffa newsgroup before I got back.  So all the things I've
seen have been mainly in later replies.  If I get the facts wrong, well...

I've read something having to do with a rape analogy.  This is a tad strong
(depending on how you define tad :-).  The picture that comes to my mind is
of a teenage girl watching her diary being passed around after someone grabs it
from her.  Now, the things in a diary could be for public consumption (look
at Andy Warhol's as a first-order approximation), or they could be totally
private.  Regardless, one shouldn't steal and read, one should ask and then
abide by the writer's wishes.  So I do believe that IED has done the right
thing by writing to Kate.  If she asks him to burn the tape, well, he should
do it (whether he'll actually do it is quite a different matter, as he may
play a role similiar to that person (the name escapes me) who saved Kafka's
works, contrary to Kafka's wishes).

Until I hear that Kate has given her approval, the $6.50 will reside in my
bank account.  Almost nothing in this world is SO important (leave the
theological KT crud out of any replies, please) that we should hurt people to 
attain it (an example of one of the possible exceptions:  medical research?
This is a philosophical matter). _Obscurities_2_ is definitely not an exception.
Life will go on.  The sun will shine and the birds will sing.  No matter
what |&gt;oug, the high priest of the church of KT, says.

What I'd like to know is where these tapes came from?  I mean in the beginning.
How many tapes were originally made, one for KT, one for Dave Gilmour, ones for
who else?  How did the original bootlegger come across this?  At the EMI vaults?
I'm curious to know the chronology of a bootleg tape like this.  Any example
would be appreciated, even if it does not involve KT.

Peter
