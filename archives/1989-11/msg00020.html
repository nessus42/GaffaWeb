&gt;Really-From: henrik@eddie.MIT.EDU (Larry DeLuca @ The Bandykin Server)

Who gets hurt by making the tapes 'public domain'
&gt; 
&gt;	1.  EMI.  
&gt; 
Why - because they they cannot make money off material they have no intention
of releasing - this not only fails as a logical argument but as a moral one.

&gt;	2.  Kate Bush.
&gt;	    If she doesn't make money, she don't make no music.
Sorry but I don't really think that KT 'makes music for the money' - are you
sure you aren't talking about the Rik_Astley_Abonimations Tape? :^) 

&gt;	3.  The zillions of Kate Bush fans everywhere.
Why - because a hundred 'die-hard' fans have tapes of some obscure demos that
they wouldn't normally have access to other than the highly 'shady' bootleg
market.

I also have a question for IED - how is it known that KT does not want this
material released?  I would never try to guess KT's motivations but unless
KT has publicly stated that "I really don't want anyone to have those tapes"
I would tend to say that EMI might have released a statement to the effect
'Kate doesn't want those tapes released' just due to the $$$ concern.  I 
highly doubt that Kate has been 'troubled' over the surfacing of these tapes
- I think that we (in this group) are over-reacting to this issue ( as I 
"remember" it's been known to happen :^)  )
And as far as 'looking people up' and demanding tapes - yeah right...
