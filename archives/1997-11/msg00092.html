<P>Don,</P>

<P>I couldn't agree with you more. I too bought JLP before it was a hit, and 
played it for a few set of friends, who all thoght it was remarkably expressive 
of todays culture. 

<P>Also, it doesn't help when we are stuck in the North American radio climate, 
where impact is more important than art. Take any Kate album, or most recently, 
PSB's &quot;Bilingual&quot; which although critically acclaimed and supported by 
most of the pasts PSB fans, without radio airplay, it is destined to become just 
another record, with very limited appeal.

&gt;Since when does whether or not a song goes to the top of the charts<BR>
&gt;have anything to do with with whether or not it's a &quot;good&quot; song? I 
can<BR>
&gt;only think of a handful of songs that made anyone charts in the last<BR>
&gt;few years that I tbought were any good.<BR>
<BR>
By the same token, NOT making the charts doesn't make a song good. And<BR>
every song that makes the charts is not, by definition, bad. A song's a<BR>
song. Sometimes good things happen to good songs.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I don't agree at all that marketing is everything. I'm sure if Kate<BR>
&gt;Bush were marketed exactly the same way that Alanis Morisette was the<BR>
&gt;results would be different.<BR>
<BR>
Of course they would. Millions, and I mean millions, of women relate<BR>
directly to the thoughts and emotions displayed on AM's hit album. I got<BR>
the record long before it was a hit and played it for many people who<BR>
usually hate &quot;charttoppers,&quot; but felt a great bond with that 
record.<BR>
Interestingly, KB was the first person I thought of when I first heard AM's<BR>
album. I thought of her as a post-punk KB.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; For the most part, mass marketed chart<BR>
&gt;topping songs have a sort of lowest common denominator appeal. They<BR>
&gt;sound alot like most everything else on the radio, they're lyrically<BR>
&gt;simplistic and they don't challenge the listener. It's music for<BR>
&gt;the masses. Kinda like the way that McDonalds has undoubtably<BR>
&gt;sold more coffee than your favorite neightborhood coffee shop, but<BR>
&gt;very few of would say that McDonalds coffee is better. It's simply<BR>
&gt;more accessible.<BR>
<BR>
Right. But many people claim McDonald's makes the best fries on the planet,<BR>
no matter how many they sell.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I'd bet a bunch of money that no matter how you wanted to market<BR>
&gt;Ani DiFranco, she'll never make a top 40 chart.<BR>
<BR>
If you had heard AM's record before it was a hit, you probably would have<BR>
made the same bet. If you had heard Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; before it 
was a<BR>
hit, you probably would have made the same bet. ADiF clicks with enough<BR>
people (not me), that a hit record from her is certainly possible. If the<BR>
next KB record tops the Billboard chart and sells a few million, will you<BR>
disown it. Personally, I judge a record on its merit, and I don't care if<BR>
it sells 10 or 10 million copies.<BR>
