The last several of my posts have not managed to cross over to 
gaffaland, but I'll keep trying. Once more into the void...

&gt;I was recently looking at local Chapel Hill, North Carolina singer-
&gt;song writer Heather Russell's website, and came across this quote from
&gt;a review of one of her performances (Hope you don't mind, Heather):

&gt;".... a branch of rock music pretty much invented by &lt;Kate&gt; Bush
 &gt;and plied solely by women. Like Bush and Siberry ....."

&gt;Thinking about it, that appears to be a true statement.  With my rather
&gt;limited exposure to the music scene, I cannot think of a male singer -
&gt;songwriter that would belong in the same genre as Kate Bush or Jane
&gt;Siberry or Sarah MacLaghlin.

&gt;Any thoughts as to why that is so?
&gt;Or does someone know of a male whom one might consider in the same
&gt;classification?

    I'd like to nominate the tragically recently deceased Jeff Buckley.
Jeff drowned in the Mississippi river two days ago, although at this
writing his body has not been recovered.

    Jeff is the son of Tim Buckley, and one of the few males to attempt
to really *use* his voice. (Imagine Robert Plant with more range and
more freedom). I can't consider him in the same league as a songwriter,
but with only one album, Grace, under his belt, who knows where
his music might have gone. Sadly, we'll never know.
