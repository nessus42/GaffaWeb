Hi, I've been lurking for I dunno how long now....  I used to make pretty
regular contributions, but lately I've rediscovered Elvis Costello and put
Kate on the back-burner for a while.  I played Hounds Of Love for the
first time in a month last night, and was blown away by it yet again.  

Anyway, this sparked a really weird dream...  Kate was at my place (yeah,
yeah yeah!) and was talking about her new album.  We were just having a
friendly sorta chat, over a cup of tea and toast.  :)  She played a part
of the new album, and I remember just standing there, mouth wide open in
awe.  She'd weaved her magic yet again.

Then the dream skipped back a few years, to somewhere in between "The
Dreaming" and "Hounds Of Love", and Elvis Costello had written a song for
Kate to record.  (So now, both Elvis and Kate were here, talking about
this song).  The song was something about a dream, and Kate kept pointing
out lines to Elvis, saying, "If this song's meant to be about a dream *I*
had, *that* line just wouldn't belong..." or, "I don't know about this
rhyme." Anyway, it ended with Elvis leaving almost in tears (and years
later giving the song to Wendy James), and Kate laughing wickedly.  :)

Anyway, what it all boils down to, is even though I haven't been playing
Kate's music all that much recently, it's something I can always come back
to, and will always have a special place in my heart.  And I can't wait to
hear something new from her!

Thanks for bearing with me.  I had to get this dream down while I still
remembered it.  :)

-Dave.
