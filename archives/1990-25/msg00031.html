<PRE>
i wandered into the local record store today after
work and was mulling around in the c's when malcolm,
the store slave, walked up and says, "hey, we got a 
new kate cd in yesterday". i believe i said, "huh?!?"
and he replied, "i figured you could tell me what it 
is and i'll give you a discount".

well, that was good enough for me. and sure enough,
it's a new bootleg cd - however, the material is 
not new - it is, infact, the selections of the 
cathy demos from _cathy's album vol 1_, plus the two
demos of "babooshka" that have been floating around.

the cd is called _if you could see me fly_ (which is
bound to coause confusion with the boot lp of the 
same title, but different content) and is on chapter
one digital recordings. packaging is great - the 
close-up from the jewel booklet of _lionheart_ 
graces the cover and KaTe in lionsuit on box is on
the back. what's really nice are the three photos
on the inside of the booklet: KaTe and bass from 
the tour of life, a face shot of her wearing a 
black low-cut blouse and a small insert of KaTe in
a tweed vest and white bell bottoms. just noticed that
this pic has two inserts on it - must be stolen from 
some magazine, i presume.

the bootleggers identify the demos as "KaTe bush home
demos - recorded 1974" whch is still uncertain (i believe
ied maintains that they date from `73, but i suppoe
it matters not). a message reminiscent of those describing
the superior sound of cds (as well as their ability
to reveal the deficiencies of analog recording :)
shows up, as does this memorable quote: "all rights
reserved. unauthorized cpoying, hiring, lending, public
performance and broadcsating of this product prohibited".
such wags, these bootleggers, no? :) on the cd, they add 
the word "diffusion" to the quote. hah! :)

sound quality? well, it sounds much better than the 
two cathy's albums, just cos it's a cd and there is no
tape hiss as on _fiddle_ of the needle noise of  the
two other albums or the eps. i'd even go as far as to
say that the bootleggers did a bit of touching up
to the sound since there is something cleaner about
it as well. i wonder of the source then: was it the guy
(an ex-emi employee as _homeground_ postulates) who
made the eps? or was it somebody who decided to press
cds of the two albums? my guess is that later since
the song titles match those on _cathy's album one_ and
on the spine of the cd, it sayd "chapter one".

nevertheless, a good package. if you see it, grab it.
i paid about $22 for it which is about the running price
for boot cds these days. there was one other at the store,
but i know it'll be gone tomorrow since malcolm's bringing
it to a record expo in somerset, nj. i'll be there as
well...poking through stuff and stuff... :)
