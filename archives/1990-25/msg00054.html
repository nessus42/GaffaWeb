Jorn, your diversionary tactics are highly entertaining, I'll give you
that.  Ignoring all those silly insults (I am not a poorly programmed
automaton, I'm an AI based on a mental patient, really!), let's get
back to the original post and try to make some sense of things, shall
we?

You ("Jorn") wrote this.  The referenced "you" is Richard.  Try to
keep up with me on this.

&gt;Vickie says "Kate is not into Gurdjieff" without any citations and you make
&gt;warm fuzzy jokes; I say she obviously is and cite several song-quotes, and
&gt;you back them up yourself with a newsletter quote, and then you accuse _me_
&gt;of making nebulous claims?  Gimme a break!!!

I don't see how citing a newsletter quote puts one on nebulous footing
in the least.  This is the author speaking of her personal life/self.
The words in a song are not necessarily connected to an author's
personal life/self.  If you can PROVE otherwise, then fine, but I
think you'd need to look at an interview to do so.  Biographical
details can only _illustrate_ a text, not prove any claims about it.

As for nebulous claims, your assertion that "all and everywhere"
_must_ be a reference to the "All and Everything" series seems
particularly "nebulous" to me.  Maybe she just saw the title on the
spine of a book and thought it was a nice string of words that, with a
little creative alteration, would fit well in her song.  Serious
artists, such as Kate and myself, do that all the time.

What's your next ploy going to be?  My money's on "I was quoted out of
context."  Anyone want to start a pool?
