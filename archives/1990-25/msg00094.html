&gt;	Has anyone heard the new AMAROK CD by Mike Oldfield? If so,
&gt;what are your impressions (i.e. inrelation to his other works, such
&gt;as Ommadawn, Hergest Ridge, etc.)?


&gt;thanx,
&gt;Bob

Considering the standard of Mike Oldfield's most recent releases 
("most recent" meaning "Crises" and on), I'd say "Amarok" is quite 
astonishingly good. It's long (runs about an hour), and contains
a number of really fine tunes. Perhaps too many, in fact - the most obvious
criticism of the record would be that themes appear and disappear in
too quick succession,and aren't given any chance to develop. It's
also rather fragmented in style - folksy pipe tunes, bits of
jittery pop and standard-issue screechy Oldfield guitar bits all
rubbing up next to one another.

For that reason, I wouldn't quite rate it with the two albums you
mention, but it's certainly there-and-abouts: and a light year away
for sure from that awful "Wind Chimes" thing on "Islands". A few
miscellaneous comments:

(i)  everything about "Amarok" suggests a deliberate attempt on
     Oldfield's part to return to the style of his older records, not
     least the credits ("Mike Oldfield plays...enormous list of 
     instruments, including 'long hollow cylindrical metal things' 
     and 'not much synth at all really', both sic"). There might
     be a story behind this. Anybody out there know?

(ii) the back cover (of the LP) bears the following "Warning: This
     record may prove harmful to cloth-eared nincompoops". (!)

(iii)on the end of one side, there's a long speech in Mrs Thatcher's
     voice (done by a well-known impressionist), delivered over a
     tribal drumbeat. I find this bit totally incomprehensible: if it's
     satire, I don't get it. Fortunately, it doesn't spoil the rest
     of the record.

Sorry if I've gone on too long: but Mike Oldfield's albums were my
first real musical love, and he's *finally* released
something new that I can be enthusiastic about! I would recommend
anyone (cloth-eared nincompoops of course excepted :-]) to buy "Amarok". 
In fact, buy it twice. 

'Bye,

- Neil
