"And Dream of Sheep"

We didn't really need to dream of sheep; they were very much in evidence
at Top Withins, where I and other Katefans joined the Homeground team
for Wuthering Hike III (The Revenge), on Saturday 29th October.

For those of you who may be confused, Top Withins is the place that is
commonly held to be the house that Emily Bronte used to model Wuthering
Heights, the Earnshaw family home in the book of the same name.  Sadly, it
is a ruin now, with just parts of the external walls intact.  Still, every
few years the Homeground team arrange a get-together of fans, to meet
there.  This was the third time they had done it.  I thought it would be
a great opportunity to meet other fans, so I decided to go.  It would also
be a chance to visit Haworth itself, and see the Bronte Parsonage Museum
And other sites.  My mum, who is not a Katefan as such (although she could
hold her own in a conversation) but is a Bronte fan, wanted to come along
too.  This was useful, as she could navigate for me ...

We set off and two and a half hours later, with only minor mishaps, we arrived
in Haworth.  After a bit of hunting, we found a place to park the car, near
the footpath to Top Withins, and started the two mile walk across the moors.
The weather was ... traditional is the best word, I suppose.  It was rather
cold, but not too bad, and the rain held off (mostly).  The walk was fairly
easy.  We didn't see too many people around, and I was beginning to get
a little worried until I saw a rather untidy KT symbol scratched on the
path.  I knew then I was on the right track.

Eventually, we arrived at Top Withins itself, after about 40 minutes of
walking.  There were quite a few people there, but I did not know any of
them personally.  Of course, Peter and Krys Morris were there, and I knew
them by sight, and was glad to meet them properly.  Sharon and Debbie were
there too, I think, but Dave could not make it because he was frantically
organising the Convention.  Apparently, the others are leaving him to it,
because he is a very good organiser.

Krys and Peter tried to get a card in Haworth to send to Kate, which everyone
could sign.  Unfortunately, there weren't any good cards, so they just
had a piece of paper.  This would then be put inside a good card, when they
found one.  Of course, people wrote well-wishing messages.  One person
wrote "A few minutes ago, a sheep put its head on my shoulder".  I was fairly
unimaginative, I'm afraid.  I simply wrote, "My hands are frozen, so I can't
say much.  Lots of Love, Stephen".  I saw quite a few similar messages.

Of course, there was lots of talk about the Convention.  Peter said that
she will be there, of course, but doesn't know what she is going to do.
In fact, he said that even Kate herself doesn't know what she will be doing,
and probably won't until she arrives on the stage.  Be prepared for anything!

Anyway, I wanted to look around Haworth before I closed, so I had to go
early.  I asked Peter if he wanted me to pass anything on to Love-Hounds.
He said to say "Hi!" to everyone, and could anyone who is going to the
Convention please send their ticket money as soon as possible - they are
on a very tight schedule.

So I said goodbye to Peter and Krys and everyone else, and started back for
Haworth.  We looked around the Parsonage Museum (fascinating!) and browsed
around the town itself.  Then, tired but very satisfied with the day,
we went home.

Stephen
