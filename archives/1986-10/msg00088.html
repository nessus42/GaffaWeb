&gt; From Andrew Marvick:

&gt;&gt; valas

&gt; Who is this abusive person, and why is he/she so angry?

Don't get too upset, Andrew.  I mean according to Kate, Sid Vicious
got into Rock 'N Roll Heaven, right?  And I'm sure if Sid were alive
today and here, and we told him that we were going to buy Big
Country's album just to hear Kate sing, he'd be must less tactfull --
he'd just regurgitate on us.  Ah, culture.

&gt;&gt; [Me:] The price is 25.00 Pounds [for *Cathy*] (no, Kate doesn't
&gt;&gt; come cheap!) per copy...

&gt; And the Sterling draft cost me another $20.00! And two more volumes
&gt; in preparation! Ah, but what price Art?

"Sport death", I always say.  I sent British cash.

&gt;&gt; You don't even need HoL in there.  But we should probably also give
&gt;&gt; a nod to Stravinski and The Beatles....

&gt; I still cannot accept that HoL is somehow less significant
&gt; than The Dreaming, simply because it is more "accessible", or
&gt; less "threatening".

But *The Dreaming* is clearly more significant than *Hounds of Love*,
because it came first.  It is a landmark.  It did new things, created
new sounds, explored new territories, used the studio as a
compositional instrument to an unprecedented degree.  The rest of pop
music is still catching up to it.  *Hounds of Love* is mostly a
refinement and mixture of everything Kate had previously done into
something more immediately muscial.  One might argue that it is as
good (though it isn't), but it's certainly not as important.
