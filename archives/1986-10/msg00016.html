The following is the Ministry chronology as I know it (probably not
absolutely complete) :
Cold Life (12") - Bitter, hard-edged funk.  Less industrial than the
  current stuff, but much harder than most of "With Sympathy".
With Sympathy (LP) - their debut album, on Arista records.  I'd call it
  better than average synth-funk - I like it - but it's much slicker and
  less challenging than "Twitch".
I Wanted To Tell Her (12") - remix of a song from "With Sympathy", not a bad
  remix, but in keeping with the style of that album.
All Day (12") - (a remix appears on "Twitch")  Starting to move towards the
  heavier sound, with some found voices, but without the patented Adrian
  Sherwood noise (which is fine by me, I find it monotonous after awhile).
  The B-Side "Halloween" is also great.
The Nature Of Love (12") - Classic.  Starting to move distinctly into Cab.
  Volt. territory, but perhaps a bit more narrative.  Centers around found
  voices saying things like "If a man wants to beat his own animal, that's
  his business".
Over The Shoulder (12") - Adrian Sherwood steps in as producer, (he also
  produced the album), and a great, searing, industrialized dance tune is
  born - another version appears in "Twitch".
Twitch (LP) - The band's most recent offering.  I have yet to listen to it
  all the way through at the radio station, but it hasn't particularly struck
  me yet.  Given the reccomendations around here though, I may yet...

     Final notes : all of the above recordings are on Wax Trax! records,
  except for the first LP, and the single from it, which are on Arista.  The
  first single has now been re-issued.

                         Grooving in the bus lane,
                                        -Peter Lee

      And it's better than a cold bath with someone you dislike..."
