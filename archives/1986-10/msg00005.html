well, all you "post-moderninsts" out i gots a story for you.  I was told
by no other than a post modernists who shall remain nameless due to his
straight edge ness that the only post modernist band is No Trend. Which
is why you should go see them.   They must be cool, cause lydia supper
thinks they are...

here a story from the paper written by susie's friend and partner in
opressing the independent records JD Constantslime:

(from the washington compost weekend section)

"Arty english dance bands follow a familar formula these days.  In any
given song, the basic beat is laid down by the drums, and then
reinforced alternately by the bass, which otherwise takes a semi-melodic
role, and the guitar which is treated heavily enough to add ambient
noise to the general pulse.

Flesh out the sound with some tinkling piano or arcane percussion, add
some nasal, nearly tuneless vocals and you've got the makings of a full
feature in Melody Maker or some other British paper."

DID YOU READ THIS ???

I mean this guy is even on your wimpy, non-amerricanistic side when it
comes to music, mainlu because most american bands and labels are smart
enough to realize that all these slimey writers want are freebies.  I
know a few american labels which do not cater to this kind of
back-scratching ideology (Dischord stands number 1 on this list).

see what JD is saying ?? go to england, get a drum machine, a synth,
some bad vocals, and a haircut and you got yerself a NME spread...which
is what most bands do anyway.

Peter, my boy - your logic is so full of stupid holes I'm not even gonna
bother to respond, I have more important things conversations to carry
on. god is sending me all this mail and i cant respond to it fast enough
(what you dont talk back to your god ?? why not I ask).  rossi and
taylor should have there mailboxes full sooner or later.

more slime for ya...

Mornign Glories/ Pussy Galore dc space two weeks ago

didn't see you hear sue, what happened, dc space not akin to giving out
free tickets ??

Morning Glories were once again, on the train to making a record.
They've gotten there act together more than last time I saw them. Mitch
Parker is still Mitch Parker, there female guitarist is singing more,
which is a plus cause I love her voice and am not crazy about the other
guitarists voice. The drummer's mom was there, so he hadda play 'real
good' for mom.

Pussy Galore, billed as 'Better than Jesus and Mary Wankoff, cause they
have two good drummers instead of one bad one !!'  They also only charge
3 dollars for the event, 11 less than the english wavos did.  There
second percusisonist actually used a car spring on top of an oil drum
and knocked out the rhythm with a hammer and hollow pipes.  You know
these dudes are hot when they first cover Throbbing Gristle's "Hot on
the Heels of Love" and ABSOLUTELTY shredded the song into little pieces.
later they also covered some stones tunes (get off of my cloud being
one) and had a "Pussy Jam" where they invited people to step up and pound
away on the oil can for the duration. Me ?? naw, it was 1:30 and I hadda
split so i could sleep so i could sit in a car for 7 hours with a sweaty
slimey scumball.

Meat Puppies / trend-o-rama

yawn. boring. friendof mine fell asleep downstairs.  sold out show. WHY
i asked myself.  still can't figure out that one.  i mean albums 2 and 3
were great, but 4 ?? yawn a matic. taking themselves too seriously I
believe. "Gee lets be cool and see the meat puppets".  stay home and
wait for scratch acid.

wank wank
