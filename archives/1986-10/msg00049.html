STOP PRESS:

"Agent Orange Song" came today.
This is the recording of a song
about the Viet Nam war written by Muriel
Hogan, which is included in a tape
of Viet Nam veterans' music compiled
by Country Joe McDonald, entitled
"Tape Talk #4". Tower Records' "Pulse!"
Magazine mentioned as an outstanding
cut the a cappella rendition of
"Agent Orange Song" by Kate Bush.

The song is sung by Kate Wolf
(American post-hippie folk-singer).

There went $8.50 down the drain,
along with all of IED0DXM's expectations.



Doug thought L-Hs might appreciate the following
bit about The Ninth Wave, taken from a letter
from IED to Break-Through. It's an interpretation
of one of the teensy-weensy details in the recording.
What similar contributions can the L-Hs make in response?

&gt;Frank brings up another extremely interesting point about
&gt;the barely audible details in "Watching You Without Me", on
&gt;which I think I can shed some light. At the very beginning,
&gt;two male voices can be heard speaking. After many fruitless
&gt;listenings, it suddenly hit me what was going on. If you
&gt;count along with the beat from the very first down-beat of
&gt;the recording, voicing only the first beat of each bar (that is,
&gt;voicing ONE {two-three-four} TWO {two-three-four}, etc.) up to
&gt;eight -- the length of the rhythmic introduction of the song --
&gt;you will then have the solution. Almost immediately you'll hear
&gt;one musician ask "What's that?" He means, "What bar is that?"
&gt;Then, at bar four, that same musician calls out "four" -- but
&gt;he calls it out on the third, rather than the first beat of that
&gt;bar. Another musician then confirms the beat, on the FIRST beat
&gt;of bar five. Following this, you can hear them counting out the
&gt;first beats of bars six, seven and eight in unison. This was
&gt;probably recorded quite early on in the rehearsals, and probably
&gt;at the original "demo" stage of recording. However, knowing Kate's
&gt;perfectionism, and the classic character of this exchange,
&gt;it's just possible that it was actually a staged re-recording
&gt;of an incident similar to many that must have occurred during the
&gt;original demo stages of the recording.
