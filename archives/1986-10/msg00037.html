Sometimes I think that someone should just off the entire British music
press.

I just read two disgusting articles on Peter Gabriel and one on Kate
Bush.  The two articles on Peter Gabriel, one in Blitz and one in Melody
Maker, were both written by this jerk named Jim Shelley.  I realized
they were by the same person by the inane writing style.  In both the
articles, he is extremely petty.  He spends most of the time talking
about how pathetic Peter is because when Peter talks he pauses and says
"er..." a lot.  The fact that he thinks Kate Bush is "our only genius"
does not redeem him.  In fact, his articles seem like parodies of all
those awful articles several years back on Kate Bush, where they spent
all their time attacking her because she'd say "wow" and "amazing" all
the time.

The article on Kate Bush is just as bad.  Richard Cook insults Peter
Gabriel; defames all of art-rock, the Grimm stories and the excellent
movie *The Company of Wolves*; and calls Pink Floyd "the most miserable
group that ever existed" in the process of attacking Kate.  But I think
that these quotes from the article

	... Like her underwear, her guard doesn't drop for a moment....

	... The cosiness of Bush denies her any erotic standing in pop.
	She's a family girl, surrounded by the domestic glow of brothers
	and parents.  If people fantasise about her, it must be as an
	elfin sprite, an immortal of love, not a flesh and blood thing
	with the smell of female.  She's just too *nice* for that....

	... And, somehow, we find it all fascinating.  Then we knock;
	but she does not let us in-a-her window.

make it clear that Mr. Cook is just a pathetic lovelorn man who probably
has an uncaring family and who is probably scared of any woman who is
more than just a cunt.  Is this supposed to be journalism?  I almost
feel sorry for the guy...  I hope he can swim -- he's going to have to
do a lot of that when the flood comes...
