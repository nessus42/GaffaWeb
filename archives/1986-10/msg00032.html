&gt; From: J. Peter Alfke &lt;alfke@csvax.caltech.edu&gt;

&gt; From Hugh Maher's letter to "Sounds", re one critic's attack on Kate:

&gt;&gt; I find it (as the saying goes) "Amazing" that the oh-so-literal
&gt;&gt; meaning of the song (i.e. lashing out at snotty-nosed frustrated
&gt;&gt; rock-star failures-turned sniping critics such as himself) failed
&gt;&gt; to pierce his Sugar-Walled brain.  Perhaps we should convince
&gt;&gt; Sheena Instant to cover it, and bring it down to his level.

&gt; Um, while I do agree, from the excerpts you posted, that the snotty-
&gt; nosed critic in question could benefit from a nice cup of coffee
&gt; homeground [:-)], I must admit that I don't see where you get your
&gt; interpretation of "The Big Sky" from.  I always thought it was about
&gt; daydreaming watching clouds.  (Sound like Kate herself, don't I?)

Well, let's take a closer look at some of the lyrics:

	They look down at the ground, missing.
	But I never go in now --
	I'm looking at the Big Sky,
	...
	You never understood me,
	You never really tried.
	...
	This cloud, this cloud says "Noah,
	c'mon and build me an Ark"
	And if you're coming -- jump
	'coz we're leaving with the Big Sky
	...
	You want my reply?
	What was the question?
	I was looking at the Big Sky

And let's recall something Kate once said about this song:

	"It's also suggesting the coming of the next flood how perhaps
	 the 'fools on the hills' will be the wise ones."

So who are these people who look down at the ground missing the true
meaning of life?  Who never understood Kate and never really tried?
Who demand replies from her to boring questions?  Who are doomed to
drown the next time the riff-raff are purged from the Earth?

Seems to me like the "frustrated rock-star failures turned sniping
critics" are awfully good candidates.

			"No it doesn't"
