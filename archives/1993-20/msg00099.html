<PRE>
Andrea inquires of IED his reason for raising the subject of charter
air flights, suggesting that he might have special knowledge of a tour. 
The answer is no, Andrea.  IED read Peter's amazing HGFLASH, and
assumed (rightly, as we have since learned) that Kate would not appear
on British television to present a track from a forthcoming album if
there were not a real plan to release that album; and that Kate might be
planning to tour, too, as she had said she might, back in 1990.  IED did
not mean that a flight was planned in order to attend the Aspel show 
appearance (though it would probably be worth it). Special knowledge
of a tour? No. Faith that something good is going to happen? Yes!

No, the list of guest musicians does not seem like "too many stars"!
This is Kate Bush we're talking about here.  Even on a clear night in
Yosemite, when the stars seem to fill more space than seems possible,
you can always spot the North Star -- the added company makes it seem even
brighter, if anything.  And when you wish upon a star, your dreams
come true...

IED thanks E. Stephen Mack for his kind and flattering words.

IED thanks HOMEGROUND for their considerate timely postings of late,
which he can confidently say have brightened the world of a great many
people, not just the world of this grateful fan.  Thanks, Peter.

Take care, everyone.  IED will unfortunately soon be heading back into computer
oblivion, there to remain until sometime after Katemas 1993.  He will continue 
to be reachable here until June 18, and by phone, as of July 1, at
415/666-0683.  And he will find ways to keep abreast of philo-canine
KonversaTions in the meanwhile.

-- Andrew Marvick (IED), heading to the video store to rent that
magical old classic movie, The Red Shoes...
