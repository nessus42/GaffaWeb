&gt;I saw on MuchMusic the other night an interview with Sarah Brightman.  She was
&gt;talking about her first "contemporary" release entitled "Dive".  She described
&gt;it as being a combination of Enya and Kate Bush...but definitely Sarah
&gt;Brightman. ...

Erm, more like a combination of Enigma and Madonna.

&gt; ... Soooooooooo I rushed out to the record store and picked it up.
&gt;Boy was I disappointed! ...

I bought it 'cos I have some of her other albums. I didn't even know she had a 
new album out until I saw it in the music shop. I was definately _not_ 
disappointed. Surprised, yes: I never thought of her as a trash pop/dance 
artist (Although I suppose the production team had more to do with the sound 
of the album than ms Brighman (correct me if I'm wrong)

&gt;...  The first single is OK (Captain Nemo) but the most of
&gt;the others sound too similar...both vocally and musically. ...

But doesn't most modern pop music sound similar? This album will probably 
outsell her previous work just by being _normal_

&gt;...  The biggest shock
&gt;was that her voice (incredible in the Phantom of the Opera) sounded like...like
&gt;....Madonna?  Very thin and limited. ...

Granted, her voice is not the strongest in the music business. In Phantom, her
non-singing voice (and sometimes her singing voice) seems brittle enough to 
snap. Let's call it _delicate_ shall we? On the subject of sounding like 
Madonna, the first time I listened to track 3 on Dive, the tune, rhythm, 
vocals and practically everything apart from the lrics reminded me of 'Like a 
Prayer'

&gt;... I've never been a big fan of Enya ...

Sinner , sinner, sinner!

&gt;... but even
&gt;she should feel insulted by Sarah's outrageous claim! ...

Fair enough, you've got a point there!

&gt;...  Needless to say...Kate
&gt;has nothing to worry about. :)

I think we can all take this point for granted. Does any artist pose a threat 
to KaTe?

To be fair to ms Brightman, I loved Dive. There are some amazing songs such as 
the cover of Procal Harem's 'Salty Dog', Once in a Lifetime, Johnny Wanna Live 
and La Mer.
You can also play games with the dancy style tracks - spot the sample loop. I 
wonder, did Enigma have anything to do with this album?

Have Fun,
        Flump
