        In the discussion of different formats of various files, it 
should be noted that the archives themselves are in "ASCII" format and 
probably don't need to be translated into anything else (if I 
understand these things fully).  The reasons: 1) they don't contain any 
special formatting codes like underline, etc.  2) at the end of every 
line there is a "hard return" - so the formatting is pretty much stuck 
at 80 columns, and even if you convert it to another format (say 
wordperfect or something) it will still print out at 80 columns.  The 
only way I know of changing this is to manually delete the returns from 
every line, except for the lines that end a paragraph.  Anyone want to 
manually alter 80 megabytes!  :-)  I had to do alot of this in 
translating The Garden, and compiling Cloudbusting, and it wasn't fun!  
:-) 
        So, I think it might be better to just include it in ASCII, and 
do whatever formatting changes you want to on Cloudbusting and The 
Garden and MAYBE Deeper Understanding (most of which is directly from 
the archives and so has the same problem, even though it's currently in 
WP format).  

        A couple people have again mentioned including stuff in ASCII 
format.  As far as I know both the Garden and Cloudbusting are already 
in the archives as ASCII, I don't think the Wordperfect version ever 
(versions I mean) ever made it there. 

        Chris mentioned that the archives are currently a "mess".  This 
is certainly true, however when/if I finish Deeper Understanding, 
escentually everything of value will be in either The Garden, 
Cloudbusting, or Deeper Understanding with the repetition relatively 
minor (except for the archives which include everything.)  The only 
major repetion will be that both Cloudbusting and Deeper Understanding 
oops I mean THE GARDEN will have interviews in them, but that is only 
because THE GARDEN has the un-edited interviews (which are sometimes 
nice to read) and CLOUDBUSTING has them re-edited in a more organized 
format.  
        Oh, and of course I'm talking about "text" material, obviously 
there is a zillion picture files as well. 

        Tracy from Still Breathing told me she was planning to do some 
major scanning of pictures from her collection, if anyone is interested 
in following up on this, these would make a nice addition to any CDROM 
project.
