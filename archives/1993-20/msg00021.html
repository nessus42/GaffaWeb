INTERVIEW BOOTLEGS 

        by Ron Hill, Andrew Marvick (IED), and Ulrich Grepeland.
        
        Compiled by Ron Hill

        June 6, 1993

        NOTE!!! This list is currently very incomplete, the main 
problem being the compiler does not have access to the early bootleg 
records (though he does have all the interviews on tape), and it's very 
confusing putting a list like this together without having access to 
the records.  Eventually I'd like to have a more complete listing, with 
details as to which interviews are on which records, perhaps even the 
first question and answer from each interview.
        Interview disks mentioned in the collector's guide but not yet 
included here are: KB7, BUSH7P, BUSH 7, Chat with the Stars, BUSH 7S, 
and KATE BUSH.  Interview CDs are Greyhound and Bush 7 CD.  If anyone 
has these, I'd appreciate it if you could post the first question and 
answer from each (and whatever other information you see fit), so that 
we can determine what has what.  As far as I know, I have all of the 
interviews, I just don't know what is included on each disk.

        It should be noted that unlike other Kate Bush bootlegs, 
interview boots are actually legal.  There has been some discussion, 
however, as to whether or not that makes them ethical.  On the "no" 
side it can be pointed out that Kate makes no money from any bootlegs, 
and the boots are often shoddy and misleading.  On the "yes" side, some 
fail to see the fundamental difference between making a profit by 
selling an interview in a magazine and making a profit by selling an 
interview pressed in vinyl. 


OFFICIAL PICTURE DISCS


        The earliest is a picture disc of _The Kick Inside_,
released first in 1978, then again (without run-out groove message) in
1981 or 1982.

        The second was a seven-inch pic-disc of "The Big Sky" single,
UK only.


BOOTLEG INTERVIEW DISCS

        BAK 2006 - It is a British import, originally priced from 
between $7.98 and $10.99.
        This record is reasonably well made, as such things go. It is 
NOT, repeat NOT an official EMI release, but an attempt has been made 
to make it APPEAR to
be official (a pseudo-HoL type-style and EMI-like catalogue number). 
The two photos are in colour, and are relatively rare shots, both from 
early photo sessions with Kate wearing her old white dove earrings.  
Both were taken in 1978, probably quite early in the year. IED dates 
them that way because of the feathery choker she wears in one photo, a 
decoration which she wore during a
1978 German lip-synch. One of the photos is very distinctive: Kate 
stands against a blue background, and has both hands raised, as though 
displaying her manicure to the camera.
        The record appears to have been made by the same people who put 
out a series of SEVEN-inch interview picture-discs of David Sylvian and 
Siouxsie Sioux about a year earlier.
        This one contains an interview done with Kate in her studio by 
a British fan who apparently obtained Kate's participation by 
associating himself with an Australian group (probably the Aussie 
fanzine Dreamtime, who did send a couple of writers over to visit the 
UK KT community the year before). Kate obviously had no idea at the 
time of the interview that the tape would be used as yet another 
exploitive bootleg product.  However, this is definitely not the same 
as the infamous "D. Cross" interview which Homeground exposed as a 
fraud perpetrated by upstart rival Under the Ivy, as this is definitely 
a real one-on-one interview, whereas the other was just a fake using 
Kate's pre-recorded answers from the Canadian HoL interview record and 
a voice-over of the cue-sheet questions. Nevertheless, in the 
picture-disc's "real" interview, both the interviewer and Kate are 
extremely nervous and ill-at-ease, especially at the beginning and end 
of the interview; and the questions range from the utterly banal 
(things like "What's 'Running Up That Hill' about?") to the completely 
weird and meaningless ("The cloudbuster that Ken Hill made -- What's 
become of it?" Answer: It's in storage in a garage, of course!). At the 
very end the interviewer throws in one of the questions Kate 
particularly dislikes getting, namely, "Do you follow current affairs 
and politics, Kate?". This time it was especially unwelcome because 
Kate thought the interview was finished, and then had to stay and 
answer this last question. She gives her usual non-committal answer, 
but this time it's also clearly intended to stop the conversation -- 
the closest IED has ever heard Kate get to open annoyance.

        The interview begins: 

        I:  When you launched the album, you had a laser show at the 
London planeterium (giggle)
        K:  Yes. (laughing) Were you there?
        

        KB1011 - This one has two reddish photos, the first a shot 
taken during Kate's stay in New York in November 1985 (she is wearing 
the veddy proper white blouse and floppy bow tie in which she made most 
of her public appearances there), the other a still from either German, 
French or Dutch lip-synch performances of "Babooshka", from back in 
1980 (this was the solo performance in a red jumpsuit with a bass viol 
as the only prop). The same group of bootleggers made this and the 
previous picture disks, and both have prominent catalogue numbers and 
copyright signs all over, to lend them a false air of authenticity 
(bloody cheek). 


        KATE BUSH II - This one features two more of the 1978 
feather-choker photos, and is called "Kate Bush II".
        The other of the legitimate interviews (found on the latest BAK 
disc) has absolutely abominable sound. Let IED qualify that: the sound 
is all right, but the interview took place in a room full of loudly 
chatting people (a pub, perhaps, or at a party?), and as a result it's 
sometimes very difficult to hear all of Kate's answers. In this 
record's favour is the quality of the discussion
itself -- really first-rate. The interviewer is either English or 
Scottish, IED thinks, and he manages to do what very few Kate 
interviewers succeed in doing, namely to turn an unnatural "interview" 
session into a very comfortable, mutually respectful chat of some 
thirty minutes' length. The conversation, which dates from just prior 
to the release of the "There Goes a Tenner" single,
touches on a great many topics, and Kate makes many very interesting 
comments about subjects no-one has ever brought up with her before.
        Note this interview is also included on the CD CBAK 4011, but 
apparently it is cut short (see that entry).

This interview begins: 

        How do you get on with the situation of only bringing out an 
album sort of every two years and...
        "Well, it was difficult 'cause.. like the last album, when that 
was finished, it was just a matter of doing the promotion and then I 
free again to do another album.
  
the "CBAK 4011" version APPARENTLY ends at: 

        I think 'Oh yeah, that sound that Pad had, that'd be great in 
there.'"

Wheras this ends at: 

        I mean there's no doubt that when people change their names, 
they actually do change." 



        Kate Bush Interview, 1986 - A picture-disk 7" interview single  
The record contains the "official" promotional interview for _HoL_, 
conducted in 1986, according to the little sticker-label that is 
attached to the clear plastic sleeve of the record.  (This label is the 
only identifying mark on the product; it gives a catalogue number but 
no label name. It is set in violet _HoL_-style italic type, and simply 
says "Kate Bush Interview, 1986".)
     The interview is the "canned" promotional interview for Hounds of 
Love, the questions were dubbed in later. (see The Conversation Series 
CD entry) The quality of the pressing is okay. The quality of the 
picture-disk itself is quite high. Both photos are from about 1985/6, 
and although the record
is clearly "unauthorized", its production values are certainly as good
as those of the official 7" picture-disk of "The Big Sky".

        "Abbey Road" - A 12" picture-disk. One side features a 1985 
publicity shot
(often seen) of Kate in pink; the other is a nice twist on the _TKI_
official picture-disk. It's a photo of Kate in the green body-suit from
that disk, getting out of a chromium cylinder, but the shot is not
exactly the same as the one from the official disk. The program is
exactly the same Tony Myatt interview (47 minutes long) as heard
at the Romford convention and on the CD (see the CD entry for more 
information).    

        Words about Music WAM05 - Limiteded (500) comes in a cardboard 
box with colour photo on front, two halftone photos inside. Two 
interviews, both late 1985, approx 15mins each. I think they're both 
fairly well-known - most of what she says sounds familiar. She doesn't 
sound particularly cheeful on the first
one (neither does the interviewer) but the second is a bit better.

        "Stand Up &amp; Talk!" (1992) It's a 33rmp LP single picture disk. 
The picture is taken from the "Them Heavy People" video and gives the 
LP a weird shape. You also get a plinth (or stand) with the following 
instructions -
    - A plinth is included to enable Kate to stand up. To fit simply 
fit the
flat area of this disc into the slit on the plinth. Put on a shelf &amp; 
drool." -

    I assume it's from a series of interview LP's since it's numbered 
"Standup
2". I'm also informed that it's a limited edition and I own No. 859 of 
1500. 


        "Just Saying It (Could Even Make it Happen)" (1992) Its front 
cover shows a nice photo of Kate at the '87 BPI's (IED refers to the 
ceremony at which Kate was dragooned into handing Peter Gabriel an 
award), wearing a high-collared black evening dress, with her hair 
pinned up.  On the back is a color photo  from Kate's appearance at the 
Laserium in 1985 for the premiere of the "Hounds of Love" LP (where she 
was accompanied by Del Palmer for the first time in a social context). 
The vinyl in the copy that IED saw was a peculiar sort of 
purplish-Pepto-Bismolish opaque color.  The same interview on this 
album comprises part one of the "Words About Music" interview CD. The 
interview 
was apparently conducted circa 1985.
