          Yeah, I was pretty surprised too.. The release went by practically
unnoticed here, and the few critics who did bother to review it, weren't too
enthusiastic, even labelling Kate as a has-been... 

I though it was a pretty good effort, but I still think it's a pity her
plans to make a "Ninth Wave" film were never realised.

Hi,
I tried getting onto the love-hounds list a week ago and got a
message back saying that the server was not responding.
Someone mentioned in this group that the address has changed as of
October, but I was using the address I found in the FAQ that was
posted to this group just last week.

Needless to say, I'm confused.
So how do I get on this list?
And is there a digest form?

Thanks in advance from
a starved kate fan,

Loved Stuart's acidic castigation of these spamming, must-be-devoid-

after quickly flipping through a few old copies of Rolling Stone with 

an eye towards picking up on the kids' hip rock 'n roll scene.  
Sheesh!  Rev up the Love-Hounds death ray, O.K.?

Stuart Wilsdon's "Lionheart"

<A  HREF="http://slave.city.unisa.edu.au/Lionheart.html">http://slave.city.unisa.edu.au/Lionheart.html</A>

One of the first Kate web pages, and probably the best
"major" page. (Note:  For those wondering, "Major" pages
have significant content, while "Minor" pages are specifically
about one topic, usually on just one page.  That is not to say
the Minor pages are in any way inferior to the Major pages -
some of the best Kate pages are the minor ones - it's just that 
they simply aren't as big).

Anyway, this site started out as just a handful of scanned images,
but has grown into a beautiful resource.  All of the album covers
are wonderfully scanned, plus some digitized songs (all taken -
with credit given - from the Kate Bush Musical Extraveganza),
lyrics (including a VERY small number of non "official" album lyrics),
this is a must-see stop for all KateFans.  Also it has lotsa links to other 
Kate resources, including one I didn't know about! To top it all off, there 
is a LARGE number of jpeg's ftp-able directly from  here (thumbnails 
or an image index file would be nice, but it's still top-notch without
it).

Warning to Yanks:  This site's in Australia, so it's often VERY
slow.

As [stev0@zuni.chaco.com (stev0)] says.. yes .. My web page 
IS out of date.. and has crazy links.. and yes it is poor.. 
its all true ! :(

 I still intend on it being THE web page for Kate Fans across the
 Internet.. 

 I have had little support - most of it my fault unfortunately, 
 I would like to gather input from people on what they would like to
 see on it and I WILL start implementing it.
 
 I have invested big bucks in computer hardware ( HP color scanner
 Gigs of disk space - etc etc. and possibly a digital camera to come soon.)
 to put towards this site - it would be cool if people could photocopy 
 the CD covers of their rare CD's so I could scan them in for people to
 make a complete DISCOGRAPHY web page for example.

 I would like to see some constructive criticism so I can make the pages
 a testimony to all the true Kate fans out there.

 **  Direct all ideas for what YOU would like to see on the w
     web pages to

 Note that I have changed jobs and this is my old address - I will be
 purchasing a personal internet account soon and I will quote that

&gt;&gt; Picture an animal locked into a corner,
&gt;
&gt;Ok, I'm picturing a bunny on a leash in a corner, munching quietly on a 
&gt;sprig of alfalfa. No. Wait. I'm pictuing a brown-eyed cocker spaniel 
&gt;sitting in the corner begging for attention. No. Wait. I'm picturinng a 
&gt;contented old cow in the corner of a pasture chewing her cud in the 
&gt;warmsummer sun. No. Wait....
&gt;
&gt;&gt; this volatile moment is the ambient aura of Dazy Mae.
&gt;
&gt;Volatile moment? Gee, I guess I was picturing the wrong kind of animal. 
&gt;OK, I'm visualizing now. I visualize a rabid Newfoundland chained into a 
&gt;corner. He's being taunted with a stick and is straining to break free 
&gt;from his chain. The chain looks like it's about to break!
&gt;
&gt;Ah, yes, that must be the right image. That surely makes me think of good

&gt;music.

Stuart, have you ever tried to describe a band's sound? I think this
explanation is perfect for Dazy Mae's sound!

&gt;&gt;The band's influences range from "rock dinosaurs" like Pink Floyd (and
their &gt;&gt;contemporaries),
&gt;
&gt;Dinosaurs? DINOSAURS? Oh great, make me feel old, thank you very much. 
&gt;You probbly think anything produced before 1990 is fodder for the Oldies 
&gt;stations.

Dazy Mae is a young band, in fact the oldest member of the band is 20
years old, to them these bands are "dinosaurs". I am sure the statement
was made so that their publicist could give an example of their ages.

&gt;&gt;to the likes of Smashing Pumpkins and Throwing Muses.
&gt;
&gt;What I want to know is, how do the Muses and the pumpkins feel about
this? 
&gt;Are the pumpkins being smashed *into* the Muses before they're thrown, or

&gt;are these two completely separate acts of violence?

; ) They are two seperate acts of violence LOL

&gt;&gt;Melodic vocals and guitar mix with a tribal rhythm section to create
Dazy &gt;&gt;Mae's distinct sound. 
&gt;
&gt;Tribal rhythm section.
&gt;"Listen to those drums, Tonto. The tribe sounds restless."
&gt;"Yes, Kimosabe. They are frightened of the rabid Newfoundland."

Again, have you ever tried to describe a sound?

&gt;&gt;The band members feel that most contemporary pop/rock/alternative music
is
&gt;&gt;lacking melody, hooks, and emotion:  This is why Dazy Mae was formed.
The
&gt;&gt;band's music is a tool to challenge the audience. Listening to Dazy
Mae's
&gt;&gt;current demo or seeing them perform live is a refreshing break from the
&gt;&gt;usual monotony. 
&gt;
&gt;Oh, I see, it's kind of like a public service. "Hey everyone, this is
&gt;how music is supposed to be, just in case you forgot." How kind of
&gt;them. I bet they have discussion breaks after each song.
&gt;
&gt;"You, in the front row, how did that make you feel?"
&gt;
&gt;"Uh, I dunno. OK?"
&gt;
&gt;"No, no, you're not getting into it enough. You there in the red
&gt;shirt, what about you?"
&gt;
&gt;[zap!  A phaser blast disintigrates the red shirt.]
&gt;
&gt;"Damn Star Trek references! You with the purple hair. Can you comment
&gt;on the effectivenes of the tribal rhythm section in that song?"
&gt;
&gt;"Oh, yeah, it was, like, wow. It made me want to kill the white man.
&gt;Cool, man."
&gt;
&gt;"Very good, very good. You're really getting in touch with your inner
&gt;musician." 

Every band is trying to make a statement...to stand out from the rest.
That paragraph is only a description of how they are different. Lighten
up, Stuart!

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Part of what makes Dazy Mae's sound different from other music in it's
&gt;&gt; genre is the vocals. The melodic verses seem to rise above the
&gt;&gt; instrumentation. The reason for this is that their vocalist, Sarah
Yates,
&gt;&gt; is a classically trained soprano.
&gt;
&gt;Oh, so she's read Aristotle, you mean?

No, Sarah has an amazinglu beautiful voice, and she is trained to sing
soprano in classical music. 

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Dazy Mae is a band that has something to offer any music lover.
&gt;
&gt;All, right! Now we're talking. Just mail whatever it is to 
&gt;
&gt;PO Box 496
&gt;Moxahala, OH 43761-0496
&gt;
&gt;Make checks payable to Stuart M. Castergine!

Stuart, get a life

&gt;&gt; There is a
&gt;&gt; place for them in the music of the 1990's, and for many years to
&gt;&gt;come.
&gt;
&gt;Yes, there's also a place for Michael Bolton in the music of the '90s.
&gt;It's not just not polite to say what it is.

We all enjoy different music, obviously you wouldn't enjoy Dazy Mae: 
Point Made!

&gt;And heaven has a place for those who pray. Hey, hey hey.
&gt;Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson...

&gt;&gt; Dazy Mae play at various clubs and events within the New York
metropolitan
&gt;&gt; area.

I caught their show at the Pony and I can say that they were great. If you
get the chance to check them out, please do. Sarah Yates is an amazing
vocalist!

Subject: for kate bush

when i first listened to kate bush, i fell in love with her voice and her 
music.  i discovered "hounds" at a very difficult time in my life, and it was 
comforting.  it helped me to find things in myself that i didn't know were 
there.  about six years ago, i wrote to kate bush via the kbc.  i don't even 
remember what i wrote.  except for one thing.  now, 2 years after the release 
of trs, i find myself wondering if she read that letter herself.  i never 
really thought that she would.  in the letter was a small request.  one that i 
thought would never happen.  but it did on the second side of trs.  so, kate, 
if you read this newsgroup, did you actually read that letter?  i don't want 
to leave my name, but i live in murray, ky.  if you did i hope you remember, 
and if you do remember, tell me what it was i asked of you.  the only reason i 
want to know is because i think it's cool if you actually read your fan mail. 
and that should be added to the long list of things that should people should 
respect about you.  trust me, i'm not a quack...just curious.

all the best to everyone,

IED wrote on Jan. 3rd:
&gt; The whole second side of TRS, in IED's opinion, may be heard as a kind of
&gt; musical tribute to some of Kate's early musical influences. 

Hmmm. I can't hear a real Steely Dan simmilarity here, but I'm not an
expert.

What I'm really interested in is, which songs did she wrote before and
which after her mother's death. This seems to be one of the greatest, if
not THE greatest break in her life and it might be interesting to know
which songs have been created after this traumatic experience. 
Though she wrote "Alive and kicking", I'm not completely sure about this.
At least not around 1993/94. But time is a great healer. I hope for her.

&gt;- has formulated an opinion on the meaning of 'gaffa' but doesn't like to
&gt;  say  

wasn't that like the universe in HHGTTG ? 
if anybody ever finds an exact definition of Gaffa, this group will 
instantly disappear and be replaced by something more complex.


My first step to become a knowledgeable fan:

German HiFi magazine Audio had Kate Bush among their "midprice tips"
in issue 1/96:
"The Dreaming" wasn't one of her hit albums, but in songs like "Suspended
In Gaffa" she demonstrated impressively, how modern music should sound
to delight head, belly and feet.
[ok, this was a very short review, and a very clumsy translation...
but i'm working on that]

&gt; That paragraph is only a description of how they are different. Lighten

Uh, that *was* lightened up! I was just having a little fun with the 
post!

&gt; &gt;&gt; instrumentation. The reason for this is that their vocalist, Sarah
&gt; Yates,
&gt; &gt;&gt; is a classically trained soprano.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Oh, so she's read Aristotle, you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; No, Sarah has an amazinglu beautiful voice, and she is trained to sing
&gt; soprano in classical music. 

Warning! Warning! Danger, Will Robinson. Our attempts at humor have 
been completely ignored; the alien seems to have interpreted them as a 
hostile action! Raise deflector shields!

Hmmm, Counselor Troi, what is your analysis? Do you sense any humor here?

"I just know something good is going to happen! Just saying it could even 
make it happen!"

Thank you, Troi, that was characteristically useless.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Dazy Mae is a band that has something to offer any music lover.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;All, right! Now we're talking. Just mail whatever it is to 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;PO Box 496
&gt; &gt;Moxahala, OH 43761-0496
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Make checks payable to Stuart M. Castergine!
&gt; 
&gt; Stuart, get a life

Can you get those mail order?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; There is a
&gt; &gt;&gt; place for them in the music of the 1990's, and for many years to
&gt; &gt;&gt;come.
&gt; &gt;It's not just not polite to say what it is.
&gt; 
&gt; We all enjoy different music, obviously you wouldn't enjoy Dazy Mae: 
&gt; Point Made!

Hey, seriously, chill! I think I probably would like Dazy Mae, I was just 
teasing!

&gt; I caught their show at the Pony and I can say that they were great. If you
&gt; get the chance to check them out, please do. Sarah Yates is an amazing
&gt; vocalist!
&gt; 

I honestly would like to, but I seldom make the 550-mile trip from my 
place in *Ohio* to the NY-NJ area! If they ever tour, maybe.

End of Love-Hounds digest V12 #5
********************************


     Bill Wisner, list moderator,and list,
     
     I just read that someone is trying to subscribe to the mailling list 
     and said that she didn't succeed. She had heard that the emailaddress 
     has changed since october.
     As you guys might know I have been trying to get off this mailinglist 
     for 6 weeks now. Surprise! I haven't succeeded to get off, no, you're 
     kidding me.
     
     Bill, just one tip (if you are out there). I have seen on other 
     mailinglists that they put a little header at the top of the digest 
     version how to unsubscribe. Well, it might be handy to do that for 
     people who want to unsubscribe and you change the emailaddress on 
     them. How else are they going to find out?
     
     So, please, please, please, with sugar and a cherry on top, can 
     SOMEONE (HELLOOOOOO) out there tell me HOW I get off this list.
     And please do so by emailing me at pruijn@cclink.ivv.nasa.gov, because 
     I am not reading the mailinglist anymore.(you know why, I don't want 
     to be on this list anymore, that's why I don't read it.)
     
     Barbara
     
     FYI, I have tried Bill Wisner, root, postmaster, majordomo, 
     majordomo-owner, this list directly and the normal way(ofcourse this 
     was my first 3 attempts) and guess what, nobody is helping me out 
     here. And you know what is really ironically, somewhere in time (20 
     dec 95) I received an automated message from majordomo informing me 
     that I was NOT on the list. Well, let me tell you , when I am getting 
     mail from this list each day, I am DEFINITELY, ABSOLUTELY AND 
     POSITIVELY on this list.
