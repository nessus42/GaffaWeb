Heres a little tale for you. My good friend Caroline works in Peter 
Jones in Sloan Square in London. For those not in the know, its a 
huge department store. Well shes seen loads of stars over the past 
few months shes worked there... but then one day the amazing thing 
happened.
She did not notice who it was, working on autopilot, waiting for 
lunchbreak to come. She bagged up the purchase, some placemats with a 
fruit design not dis-similar to TRS inner album booklet thingy.
Then without looking she took the customers visa card and began to 
swipe it through the reader, the card was refused. So she tried 
again. Refusal once more. So Caroline tapped the numbers in manually 
thinking there must be a problem with the reader. Refused again, so 
she looks at the visa card. It was past its expiry date. She flipped 
the card over to see the name and started her usual spiel... "I'm 
very sorry Ms Bush but your card.... oh my god its you!"
Caroline was gobsmacked and then really embarrassed, how can you tell 
the high princess of all things wonderful that her plastic is not 
good enough???
Kate was apologetic, and offered to pay by cheque but then realised 
she would not be able to guarantee it without a card. So she was 
about to leave when Caroline suddenly burst out with "Can I have your 
autograph please?"
Sure said Kate, do you have any paper. Caroline grabbed for the 
nearest she could find.... Kates till recept complete with No Sale 
printed across in red ink. Then off she trotted. She was wearing 
jeans and a long dark winter coat and although she hadn't made any 
effort with her appearance, Caroline declared her as "sickeningly 
beautiful".
Just goes to show even goddesses have trouble with the bank!
Love to you all
Esther..xxx
P.S Chris have you got your tape yet?
