Hello folks,

first of all a Happy New Year 1996 to all lovehounds!!! I wish you all
many, many enjoyable read &amp; post sessions. May the force of KaTe be with us
always!

Yesterday I received HG 56:

- No real news. :-(
- someone found a Cathy book for L3.50 in a second hand book sale!
- They send congratulations and their best wishes for the tenth aniversary
  of lovehounds:   
  "LH has now celebrated ten years of news and terrible flame wars
   struggling for the true faith of the Goddess KaTe."
  They also send best wishes to |&gt;oug and his wife, mentioning the wedding
  under the Ivy and white roses. 
- What follows is an article from Ernest Heramia (from Watching Storms 32)
  about TL,TC&amp;TC. He gives several very interesting interpretations. Worth
  reading! The article is accompanied by a very beautiful painting of KaTe,
  dancing on top of the city, from S. Brou..(sp?). 
- "The technical bit", an article about microphones. :-) It's from "Rare
  Flowers" Kate Forbes-Pitt. I once sent off a cheque for their music, but
  it seems to be lost somewhere (?). 
- "Running up that Hill" from our very best Garrick Twinney! About the
   Glastonbury Katemas gathering. Can you be more precise about the HoFAM,
   please?
- A piece about Sufi masters, Islam etc. by PDFM. Very interesting. 
  Attar the Chemist as a forerunner of Bunyan's Pilgrimage...

- Songs of love, murder, sex &amp; bald women by Krys. 
- Five years ago

- Letters:
  
   "... There's nothing wrong with TRS as an album, but I can't agree with
   Kate's attitude that it's okay to record and release deeply personal
   songs, but not to talk about them."  --Su Goulding
   [For me, this is completely okay! What you can't talk about, put it into
    a song... 
    "It's so deep, I don't think that I can speak about it." --L&amp;A]

  "Can I apologize for any suggestion I may have made that Kate does not
   care about her fans - I was talking from ignorance and I now know
   through personal experience that Kate does care, a hell of a lot, and
   must be one of the most considerate, kind and thoughtful people out
   here." --Linda Jones
   [Amen! Through personal experience, I can add: S R I !]
----

- Can some kind soul please translate for me this Rra-re-ro Moggy-talk,
  please, I don't get it. It's on page 8 and 30 bottom,left. BTW, what's
  the Moggy-Kate relation? I think Moggy's a bear, not a cat?

- What's the JCB-photo on page 19 about?

Well done, Peter, Krys and Dave! One suggestion: What about a more detailed
description of the pictures in the mag? For photo's: session, place,
time... For paintings: artist, background... 

Best wishes
    Wieland
