Hello friends,
best greetings to the new year and to all of you again. Join in and give me
a big "Hey, hey -jouhoooooo!" (Kate Bush, The Seer).

Some trivia: 

1. "The Red Shoes" CD is now down at the 'nice price' level:
   DM 15 = c. $10 (Saturn)      --- Is a :-) or a :-( needed here?
   For TLTC&amp;TC this is the case for some time already.
   It's a very good birthday present!

2. Listening to PG4:
   TROTH: There's this "ah-ah-ah" at 0'56 - 1'03:

 One little acknowleged Kate sample is on Peter Gabriel's Rhythm of the
Heat; the female voice singing "ah-ah-ah" doubling Peter's voice. We don't
have comfirmation on this, but a friend worked on one of Larry Fast's
Fairlight Series IIs a number of years ago, and found some samples on it
called "KATEBUSH1" and "KATEBUSH2." -- Chris Williams 
----
What do you think? Good joke, or what?
(Btw, the best song on PG4 is definitely LYHOM! When the drums set in at c.
3'50: this is pure drug!)

3. Some years ago someone mentioned in passing, that on the RUTH single the
   runout groove message is 'Precission SRI'. SRI???? --SRI!!! With some
   good will...

4. Kate:
   "I worked out this dance and mime to The Beatles' Eleanor Rigby. I just
    lived in the world of the song for days and days, dancing it, getting
    it right."  --Telegraph Sunday Magazine  July 6, 1980 

   Was there a video for this song, or did she do that on her own? Please
   excuse my ignorance, I haven't seen many Beatles videos.

 Also on "Lionheart" in the song "Coffee Homeground" some german words
appear:  "Schnitzel, wunderbar"  ("Schnitzel, wonderfull")  and, as I
believe, in a broad german sounding accent:   "Steak, oh" (spoken somewhat
like "Shdeag, ohh").  My dictionary says "Schnitzel" is "veal cutlet".
"Schnitzel" is in germany  almost synonymous with "Wiener Schnitzel"
(bread-crumbed). The most  germans like Schnitzel very much, and especialy
children. 
----
Even the second German line is too difficult for some Germans! :-)



There seemed to be some problems with the digest arround 23.12. Is this
correct? At least one mail from Homeground-Peter and two of mine didn't show
up. So I repost mine here (in part): 
Peter, can you send your mail again, please?

PS: I'm still reading the archive and I found this quote:
[re TWW boxed set:]
"Well, Volume One has absolutely blown me away, I've never heard 
most of it and My Lagan Love has given me multiple Kategasms. --Alex."

Kategasms! KATEgasms! Ooh man!
(my winner for the most horrible Kate-distortion ever!)
