&gt;&gt; Picture an animal locked into a corner,
&gt;
&gt;Ok, I'm picturing a bunny on a leash in a corner, munching quietly on a 
&gt;sprig of alfalfa. No. Wait. I'm pictuing a brown-eyed cocker spaniel 
&gt;sitting in the corner begging for attention. No. Wait. I'm picturinng a 
&gt;contented old cow in the corner of a pasture chewing her cud in the 
&gt;warmsummer sun. No. Wait....
&gt;
&gt;&gt; this volatile moment is the ambient aura of Dazy Mae.
&gt;
&gt;Volatile moment? Gee, I guess I was picturing the wrong kind of animal. 
&gt;OK, I'm visualizing now. I visualize a rabid Newfoundland chained into a 
&gt;corner. He's being taunted with a stick and is straining to break free 
&gt;from his chain. The chain looks like it's about to break!
&gt;
&gt;Ah, yes, that must be the right image. That surely makes me think of good

&gt;music.

Stuart, have you ever tried to describe a band's sound? I think this
explanation is perfect for Dazy Mae's sound!

&gt;&gt;The band's influences range from "rock dinosaurs" like Pink Floyd (and
their &gt;&gt;contemporaries),
&gt;
&gt;Dinosaurs? DINOSAURS? Oh great, make me feel old, thank you very much. 
&gt;You probbly think anything produced before 1990 is fodder for the Oldies 
&gt;stations.

Dazy Mae is a young band, in fact the oldest member of the band is 20
years old, to them these bands are "dinosaurs". I am sure the statement
was made so that their publicist could give an example of their ages.

&gt;&gt;to the likes of Smashing Pumpkins and Throwing Muses.
&gt;
&gt;What I want to know is, how do the Muses and the pumpkins feel about
this? 
&gt;Are the pumpkins being smashed *into* the Muses before they're thrown, or

&gt;are these two completely separate acts of violence?

; ) They are two seperate acts of violence LOL

&gt;&gt;Melodic vocals and guitar mix with a tribal rhythm section to create
Dazy &gt;&gt;Mae's distinct sound. 
&gt;
&gt;Tribal rhythm section.
&gt;"Listen to those drums, Tonto. The tribe sounds restless."
&gt;"Yes, Kimosabe. They are frightened of the rabid Newfoundland."

Again, have you ever tried to describe a sound?

&gt;&gt;The band members feel that most contemporary pop/rock/alternative music
is
&gt;&gt;lacking melody, hooks, and emotion:  This is why Dazy Mae was formed.
The
&gt;&gt;band's music is a tool to challenge the audience. Listening to Dazy
Mae's
&gt;&gt;current demo or seeing them perform live is a refreshing break from the
&gt;&gt;usual monotony. 
&gt;
&gt;Oh, I see, it's kind of like a public service. "Hey everyone, this is
&gt;how music is supposed to be, just in case you forgot." How kind of
&gt;them. I bet they have discussion breaks after each song.
&gt;
&gt;"You, in the front row, how did that make you feel?"
&gt;
&gt;"Uh, I dunno. OK?"
&gt;
&gt;"No, no, you're not getting into it enough. You there in the red
&gt;shirt, what about you?"
&gt;
&gt;[zap!  A phaser blast disintigrates the red shirt.]
&gt;
&gt;"Damn Star Trek references! You with the purple hair. Can you comment
&gt;on the effectivenes of the tribal rhythm section in that song?"
&gt;
&gt;"Oh, yeah, it was, like, wow. It made me want to kill the white man.
&gt;Cool, man."
&gt;
&gt;"Very good, very good. You're really getting in touch with your inner
&gt;musician." 

Every band is trying to make a statement...to stand out from the rest.
That paragraph is only a description of how they are different. Lighten
up, Stuart!

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Part of what makes Dazy Mae's sound different from other music in it's
&gt;&gt; genre is the vocals. The melodic verses seem to rise above the
&gt;&gt; instrumentation. The reason for this is that their vocalist, Sarah
Yates,
&gt;&gt; is a classically trained soprano.
&gt;
&gt;Oh, so she's read Aristotle, you mean?

No, Sarah has an amazinglu beautiful voice, and she is trained to sing
soprano in classical music. 

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Dazy Mae is a band that has something to offer any music lover.
&gt;
&gt;All, right! Now we're talking. Just mail whatever it is to 
&gt;
&gt;PO Box 496
&gt;Moxahala, OH 43761-0496
&gt;
&gt;Make checks payable to Stuart M. Castergine!

Stuart, get a life

&gt;&gt; There is a
&gt;&gt; place for them in the music of the 1990's, and for many years to
&gt;&gt;come.
&gt;
&gt;Yes, there's also a place for Michael Bolton in the music of the '90s.
&gt;It's not just not polite to say what it is.

We all enjoy different music, obviously you wouldn't enjoy Dazy Mae: 
Point Made!

&gt;And heaven has a place for those who pray. Hey, hey hey.
&gt;Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson...

&gt;&gt; Dazy Mae play at various clubs and events within the New York
metropolitan
&gt;&gt; area.

I caught their show at the Pony and I can say that they were great. If you
get the chance to check them out, please do. Sarah Yates is an amazing
vocalist!
