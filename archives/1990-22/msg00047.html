Vickie here.  I haven't been around the net recently (long story), but
I'll become a "regular" again within a few weeks.

No word from Peter about the convention. I called him yesterday but they
wern't home. I just left a message on the answering machine. I will say
again that ALL Love-Hounds (American, Canadian, British, European &amp;
Australian) will be assured of a ticket, if you sign up with me. No problem.

I do want to say that we're having a Kate party this Saturday to celebrate
Ed Suranyi's visit here. All Katefans in the Chicago area (and beyond) are
invited. The party is at 4:00 Saturday Sept. 1 and will go on for as long
as people are interested in staying. Dave Datta (the Eclectic Survey fellow)
is driving down from Wisconson. Ed brought with him Les Dogs, Rapido, GLC,
and lots of Japanese video goodies to watch. It should be fun--please come
if you're within our range.

I can't find that map I made up, but call if you need directions.

Ed here.  Well, I made it to Chicago.  You people on the East
and West coasts have to come to this place sometime.  I mean,
talk about a shrine to Kate!  And besides the Kate they've got walls
of videos, CD's, LP's, etc. on various other subjects.

I hope to see everybody here who *can* make it.  You just haven't lived
until you've seen Kate projected onto a screen ten feet diagonal!

In the meantime I'd like to do some sightseeing here, since I've
never really been to Chicago before (apart from changing planes
at O'Hare, I mean).  So does anybody have any suggestions?  If
you do, call or e-mail Vickie, not me (for obvious reasons).

Ed
ed@das.llnl.gov (but don't try to reach me here for a week.)

   =============================================================

Vickie again. It's GREAT having Ed here. I do hope everyone's not out
of town this weekend. Come on over, OK? Actually, Ed only *thinks* he's
going to go sight-seeing. We could keep him here occupied for months with
movies, videos, music and whatnot, so we'll just see how much sight-seeing
he gets to do! :-)

Any replies, Hi's or whatever to Ed should come here to:

katefans@world.std.com

Bye...

PS: I'm going to be on the air in Chicago! Details will come when I
get them. I'm so happy!
