In Article 7520 of rec.music.gaffa:  Andy Gough asks :


&gt;    Recently someone mentioned in passing that all of Kate's b-sides were
&gt;going to be released in a boxed set, probably around Christmas time, but
&gt;that they may only be availabe in the U.S. as imports.
&gt;    Does anyone have more information on this?  Is a package of Kate's
&gt;b-sides coming out?  When?  In the U.S.?

&gt;Thanks,

Andy, to my knowlege this is the story.

A few weeks ago Vickie of Chris 'n' Vickie got a phone call from Peter 
FitzGerald Morris of Homeground telling her that the Bush family have given 
the go-ahead for a CD box set of her material to be released (hopefully) 
before Christmas.  The Summer issue of Homeground confirmed this with the 
listing of non-album tracks which are going to be included on a couple or 
maybe three extra discs to the original album CDs.  The tracks included all 
the b-sides to the singles, Experiment IV extended, Wuthering Heights (new 
vocal), the HoL single remixes, December Will Be Magic, the French language 
single and b-side, and the Live on Stage E.P.  It will complete Kate's 
catalogue on CD as officially put out before by EMI.  There is no sign of 
anything that has not been available from EMI before on vinyl, much to the 
dismay of some.

At the moment it looks like the box will consist of the 6 album CDs + 2 or 3 
CDs of these tracks.  This definitely will be released by EMI in Europe.  In 
the US though her catalogue is split now between EMI Manhatten and CBS.  This 
is why it may only be available on import to the US.  With probably 8 discs 
the box will probably  sell for over  $100 here if the exchange rate doesn't 
change dramatically (as it has been doing recently). Discs from Europe cost 
about $20 each so it could feasibly reach $150 in price.  If it a special 
edition limited release it might cost even more.

There is no indication as yet as to whether the new-to-CD material will be 
available separately.  My guess is no. 

At least the material will be available on CD.  And as her import CDs sound 
better than the US versions some people will be able to upgrade their discs 
and we can sleep sound with the knowledge that a better sounding pressing in 
not available.  

I may be wrong about it being a non-US release but that is what I expect at 
this juncture.

Anyone got anything to add?

Derek
