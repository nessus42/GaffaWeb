I probably know better than to jump in to this debate, but since no one
has asked me...

Greg Larkin says (in reply to Lazlo Nibble)

&gt;	...  I didn't
&gt;       say that I would like for all concert halls to be
&gt;       tributes to the American fight for independence, I
&gt;       just said that if a particular area has a custom,
&gt;       then it should not be disturbed.

IMHO, one of the most important aspects of modern popular music is that
it _does_ disturb customs, be they local, national, or global.  Greg
quotes Midnight Oil in his signature: a good example of a group that
deliberately attempts to disturb its audience into paying attention to
political and environmental issues. Her KaTeness has built a career on
upsetting peoples ideas of pop music -- novices reactions to my playing,
say, _Get Out of My House_ tend to be shock, horror and even revulsion
(until they achieve enlightment, that is, and I untie them). Anyone who
thinks KT's music doesn't have political significance turn on the radio and
listen to the type of music women are _supposed_ to make.  If Sinead has
started some arguments in New Jersey, and maybe made some people think,
then she has helped to keep popular music an important part of our (I mean
the world's) culture.

I am also reminded that the melody of the Star Spangled Banner came from
a popular song circa 1812, and frankly, the a cappella folk songs Sinead
is singing this tour ar far more moving.  Though given the number of
goofball fans standing on their seats at Sinead's Great Woods concert,
"O say can you see" is a very appropriate sentiment... 8-]

Vickie, good to hear that you are back on the air.  Just wish I could pick
up a broadcast here in Boston... Also, thanks to those who recommended
Hetch Hetchy -- I got _Swollen_, Bossanova (Pixies), and Graffiti Bridge
(his purpleness) yesterday, and listened to them here at work today. !!
( NOTE:  Bossanova is maybe not quite as good as Doolittle, but definately
recommended, and Graffiti Bridge is great, but then I'm a sucker for Prince.)

PLEASE, y'all, keep recommending musicians and albums;  seems like I've
bought everything by my favorite artists, and I live on new music...
(OK, OK, I'm sending off for Happy's tapes!)

Footah! &lt;-  Note this is a cheerful exclaimation (from the Love and Rockets
comic book), _not_ a name.

-greg (ah, now there's a name...) -- gb10@gte.com -- "Share and Enjoy!"
