&gt;Well, Sinead O'Connor has raised the ire of
&gt;lots of people in NJ.  
Why? 
&gt;
&gt;On Friday, at the Garden State Arts Center, she
&gt;refused to play if the center played the National
&gt;Anthem -- something they always do before a concert.
&gt;They backstage people finally agreed because they
&gt;were afraid they 9000 poeple in the audience would
&gt;revolt if they cancelled the show.
&gt;
What has the American National Anthem got to do with a 
concert by an Irish musician?
&gt;Noone realized what happened until Sat.  I was at the concert and
&gt;didn't realize the anthem wasn't played.  My friend wondered about it,
&gt;but figured they forgot to play it.  I found out about it because
&gt;the Newark Star-Ledger had the story on page 3 on Sat.  
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, now several DJs in NJ are banning sinead.
&gt;WHTG's morning man, Bart Cross-Tierny, is asking all his
&gt;listeners to send thier sinead CDs, LPs, button's etc.
&gt;back to Chrylis Records and gives the address. 
&gt;

Is this stupid or what ? 
Have all Americans been brainwashed into believing that not to
play the national anthem before a concert or anything  is an 
"insult", and if so why?  Surely playing the anthem before 
an Irish singers concert might make people think she was American
not Irish.

&gt;The Concert review in monday's Star Ledger 
&gt;mentioned the incident but basically
&gt;ignored it.  The review blasted the audience for being noisy
&gt;during quiet passages and said Sinead should be mad at the audience.
&gt;I was there, it was noisy, but I think part of the problem was
&gt;Sinead sang 'I do not want...' acapella as an encore.  After
&gt;several danceable songs, I think this might of been a poor choice 
&gt;as an encore. 
&gt;

&gt;Anyway, I'm siding with the DJs.  I don't think Sinead should 
&gt;consider herself GOD (only kate is).  Too bad I didn't
&gt;know about the national athem before
&gt;the encore.  It might of be tempting to sing it.  

Personally if I go to see a concert I want to hear the concert
and not to be subjected to a jingoistic rendition of a
national anthem. 


&gt;
&gt;Oh, and by the way, a group called The Beautiful opened.  They
&gt;were absolutely horrible.  They were Boys with Guitars -- with the
&gt;execption that their guitar playing was barely average.  They tried
&gt;to cover it up by being loud.  And they had horrible stage presence.
&gt;
&gt;

This is not intended as a personal Flame,  but is just an 
expression of my amazement at why Intelligent Americans (must
be to think KT is GOD :-) think (are brainwashed into thinking ?)
that the Stars and Stripes is sacred, whether in song or as the flag.
