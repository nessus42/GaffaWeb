Personally I don't think that Sinead's latest profound act of idealism
is worthy of all this but some of the remarks made here merit comment.

First of all I don't think that it's particularly necessary or
appropriate to play the national anthem before a concert but if the
concert promoter wishes to do so that's his right.

Second, if Sinead doesn't want to be associated with our National
Anthem she has the right to excercise whatever influence she has to
prevent that.  But by doing so she is suppressing the ideas of others.
But it's "her" show, you say?  Wrong.  Her show starts when her lights
come up.  

I think the whole idea of preventing someone from saying something you
disagree with stinks.  Period.  If Sinead has objections to the
National Anthem let her speak out, let her tell us what her problem
is.  Some of you seem to think that nationalism is such an evil thing
that it should be suppressed.  Fine, speak against it, label a few
things jingoisms, burn a few flags, say what you want.  But don't tell
others that they can't say - or sing - whatever they want. 

The funny thing is that Sinead provided a perfect gimmick for the
radio stations to prey on the rising tide of patriotism.

&gt; Really-From: Steve Wallis &lt;stevew@mushroom.computer-science.manchester.ac.uk&gt;

&gt; I don't know whether Sinead sings any particularly political songs, but
&gt; imagine if KT (if she toured again...) sang songs such as _Army_Dreamers_ and
&gt; _Breathing_ - KT would certainly also refuse to be associated with an anthem
&gt; which would convey opposing sentiments and trivialise her views.

First of all I doubt that Kate would characterize those songs as
"political".  Second I think it's foolish of you to presume that Kate,
who professes not to be political, would make any such objection.
Third, your contention the U.S. National Anthem conveys sentiments
that are opposed to those of _Army Dreamers_ or _Breathing_ reflects a
profound ignorance of what that song really means.

&gt; If she realised that the hordes would start such a jihad, she would be even
&gt; more determined to stick up for her principles.  Of course, several DJs are
&gt; hardly "hordes" and don't represent the American public (although after
&gt; reading this discussion, I'm not so sure...)

So Sinead can object to nationalism and that's called principles but
if others stand up for their nationalism that's called a "jihad".  Do
you have any way to support your points beside putting "bad" labels on
things you don't like and "good" labels on those you do?

&gt; This country has a sad history of bigotry against almost every nationality on 
&gt; Earth, and incidents such as these will continue it.

This country also has a proud history of helping almost every other
nationality on earth.  That history continues in spite of the
anti-american bigotry that is so popular in many of those countries.

&gt; Really-From: Steve Wallis &lt;stevew@mushroom.computer-science.manchester.ac.uk&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The chief cause of bigotry is patriotism.  The difference between fervent
&gt; admiration of your own country and bigotry against others is slight.  Hence,
&gt; the Star Spangled Banner is a major cause of such bigotry.

This is complete and utter rubbish.  If there is a chief cause of
bigotry it is probably ignorance.   I present you as proof, your ignorance
of America and Americans is probably the chief cause of your bigotry
against them.

&gt; Oh, the U.S.A. is still fighting for independence, is it?  It seems to me
&gt; that other countries are fighting for independence from the U.S.

Case in point.

&gt; You may know that Midnight Oil strongly support the plight
&gt; of the aborigines in Australia, and would equally have supported the plight
&gt; of the Indians in the U.S. against the patriotic whites.  If they played at
&gt; the arena in question, I'm sure they would make the same protest as Sinead.

This is a riot, we're being lectured about opression by an (apparent)
citizen of the "British Empire".  Are you saying that we are required
to disavow our just pride in our country because we (and thus it) 
are not and never have been perfect?  Are you so sure that it is not 
possible to be aware of your country's faults and still object to people 
from other countries trying suppress your pride in your country?

------------

Folks, please don't insult Kate by seeking approval of your political 
views in her music.  She has always clearly stated that she is not a 
political person.
