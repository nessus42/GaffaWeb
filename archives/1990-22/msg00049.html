&gt;Did Sinead give a reason?  Many people oppose the exhibition of overt
&gt;nationalism, and certainly if you were a performing artist giving
&gt;*your* show ... well?

Absolutely.  I'm sure Sinead objected on principle, and she had every right
to do so.

Having a national anthem played conveys a political message (of support for
American nationalism), a message with which Sinead obviously does not agree.

I don't know whether Sinead sings any particularly political songs, but
imagine if KT (if she toured again...) sang songs such as _Army_Dreamers_ and
_Breathing_ - KT would certainly also refuse to be associated with an anthem
which would convey opposing sentiments and trivialise her views.

&gt;&gt;Anyway, now several DJs in NJ are banning sinead.
&gt;
&gt;Quite possibly Sinead did not realize that the hordes would start
&gt;a jihad in the name of their political religion.

If she realised that the hordes would start such a jihad, she would be even
more determined to stick up for her principles.  Of course, several DJs are
hardly "hordes" and don't represent the American public (although after
reading this discussion, I'm not so sure...)

&gt;How many venues
&gt;in the US play the national anthem before a rock show (or anything
&gt;else?).  At least I wouldn't have expected it in our area (I'm in
&gt;Manhattan) or back in Canada (where we do play ours before hockey).

National anthems do not get played at rock shows in Britain (indeed, there
would probably be an outcry if one *was* played).  Theatres, however, are a
different kettle of fish - they are quite commonplace at plays and musicals.

Steve.
