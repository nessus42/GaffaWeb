<PRE>

John Adams was asking about "door-sized" _AOTSW_ posters:  well, John, I
got mine at Newbury Comics in Harvard Square, but that was before they got
small.  Seeing as there has been no reply to my early post re KaTe posters,
I'll ask again:  Can anyone recommend a good source of KaTe posters, either
in Boston/New York or mail-order? Also, is there a love-hounds list of
KTB posters/photo sessions/etc.  I'm particularly interested in pre-HoL
stuff, though I'd love to track down the promo poster of Ms. Bush with
short (Cloudbusting video) hair and a funny Chinese sorta hat.  

Note for Jon Druckman -- yeh, you're right, I wouldn't really call Pixies/Muses
"very" alternative;  I keep forgetting that the average Love-Hound is a person
of refined musical sensibilities.  I'm just used to people saying "Throwing
who? Cocteau what? KaTe where?". *sigh*

I realize that I myself posted re Sinead's politics, so it is with the greatest
humility that I confess that I think that we have covered the debate as
fully as possible given the limitations of the electronic medium, and maybe
it is time to take it off-line.  I am interested in the question of KaTe's
music and politics.  As I have said previously, to me, Ms. Bush's music has
quite definite political/social implications, at lyrical, structural, and 
stylistic levels.  I'll grant that she may not always have political _motives_,
but as long as what she does contends against the social 'norms', it is
going to have a political significance.  I'm thinking particulrly of feminist
issues here;  since we are all theoretically interested in music by women I
hope this is pertinent.

Hey, wait a second;  I'm at work!  whoops, better go...

Footah!
