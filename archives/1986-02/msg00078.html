[Part of this message got lost in the digests because of my wonderful
non-locking software, so here it is again....  --Doug]

What with nearly all of the creative electronic ZAP artists now doing
scores for motion pictures (most notably Tangerine Dream), and other 
Berlin schoolies such as KKlaus Schulze teaming up with 60's misfits
such as Arthur Brown, we are at the brink of something (if i knew what
it was I would say).  Even my close friend Pascal Languirand (aka Minos;
aka TRANS-X) has traded in his noise generators, various sound modification
devices and other interesting 'sounding' items for multiple layered MIDI
overglorified rhythm boxes (with 127 part harmony), and an actual live
performing band.  What gives.  Isn't anyone out there doing cosmic
exploration anymore.  With the current crop of multi-tracking devices
(including the, gulp, midi stuff).  You would think that we would have
uncovered the essense of musical consciousness by now (of course I realize
that we might have but Sylvester Stallone just couldn't understand it so
it was forgotten).
    I would appreciate communicating with those overaged individuals who
are interested in the music of the mind (not the echos thereof), those
who maybe sometimes pull out there old Moog-10, Synthi VCS3 or AKS,
EML 101,200, various sound modification devices and an old TEAC 3340A 
(or maybe gust an older 3340) to try to open the doors of cosmic
conciousness in a way that even a Rosicruscian never thought of).

By the way, has anyone heard from Ash RA lately (after their disco album)
