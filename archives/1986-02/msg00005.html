&gt; From: Tim Wicinski &lt;wicinski@nrl-css.ARPA&gt;

&gt; 9. Robert Fripp - Exposure
&gt;     The Best King Crimson Album. Ever.

Yeah, great album!  But it's nothing like King Crimson.  And Daryl Hall
(oh boy!!!) co-wrote and sings on several of the songs -- can you dig it?

&gt; From: Shelli [Re desert island]

&gt;    Andrew Lloyd Webber, etc: ....
                              Requiem

Planning on a funeral?  With that attitude, you'll never get off.

&gt;   Madonna: Like A Virgin (** Put in to aggravate Doug **)

Why not just bring the 12 inch single for "Material Girl", and play it
over and over again?  Quite appropriate for a desert island.  The song
"Like a Virgin", might strike too close to home if stranded alone.

&gt;     Zula: Next Year in Jerusalem 
&gt;             (** The obvious alternative for Jews **)

You're not thinking of converting are you?  And you really want to
brainwash the impending kids to *your* religion, don't you?

&gt; From: Susanne E Trowbridge &lt;umcp-cs!jhunix!ins_aset@seismo.CSS.GOV&gt;

&gt; It has a new song by Suzanne Vega, "Left of Center," which is pretty
&gt; crummy (for lack of a better descriptive adjective) -- she did it in
&gt; concert and I didn't like it then, either.  One expects more from SV,
&gt; one of the coolest women in the universe.  It sounds like a stab at
&gt; the Top 40.

I only heard "Left of Center" once -- in concert, but I liked it.  And I
have to agree with Jimmy H about A Lot Of Maniacs -- they sure don't do
much for me.

&gt; Do you ever wonder what your fellow Love-Hounders and net.music contributors
&gt; look like?

Yeah, so I went and visited some of them.  They always look totally
different than you expected.

&gt; I do.  Perhaps we could put together some kind of photo album!  Then I
&gt; can find out if Larry Palena is really green and slimy or if he only
&gt; writes that way.

He's probably really mottled blue and slimy....

&gt; A Morgan Fairchild look-a-like,
&gt; -Sue

Did you bleach your hair recently?

-Doug
