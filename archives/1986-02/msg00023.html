&gt;        Second, anyone out there follow the band Talk,Talk? They have a
&gt;new single out (off an album, I imagine) called, damn, I can't remember
&gt;the title! (Doug, you know the title?) [No, sorry...  The last one I
&gt;heard was "Talk, Talk" -- Doug] But it's great! The last single that
&gt;they released which is called "Talk,talk" is also excellent. Anyone know
&gt;any history about this band?

Sounds like you both missed (or forgot) the 1984 release by Talk Talk
called _It's My Life_.  The title tune is very nice, and so is "Call In
the Night Boy" and "Such a Shame" and "Tomorrow Started" and "Dum Dum
Girl" and....well, you get the idea.  This is one of those records that
I burned out in record time (pun intended?) but it's been long enough
now so that I can enjoy it again.  Mark Hollis is still the singer, and
the band still has a keyboard dominated sound, although Robbie McIntosh
does add some guitar to this album (the album that had "Talk Talk" on
it, called _The Party's Over_, had no guitar).  Also features my favorite
percussionist, Morris Pert.  Nice cover art too, done by the same guy
who did _The Party's Over_, James Marsh.

"Well did I tell you before
when I was up
Anxiety was bringing me down" --"Talk Talk"
