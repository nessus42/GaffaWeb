KateManiac writes (presumably in response to my teasing him about 
people making up quotes for him by changing his "Eat the Music" to "Drink 
the Fruitopia."):

&gt;                      ...  you must be EXCEEDINGLY BORED. Just like those
&gt;acid-techno-Eurotrash dice &amp; splice goofballs, you cut and paste what I say
&gt;because YOU HAVE NOTHING ORIGINAL TO ADD YOURSELF. How sad. 
&gt;     Now go back to listening to Sinead singing rap, or whatever your taste
&gt;amounts to these long, dull days of your life.

All right, that's it. Listen you juvenile, paranoid, anti-social little 
thug. Learn how to take a joke. Your hostile, insulting, self-righteous 
ravings are getting on my nerves.

For the past several weeks all you've been doing is cutting down and 
instulting one person after another. First Tori Amos, then anyone who 
took the trouble to say that the tone of your post was inappropriate. You 
obviously have trouble getting a clue. In fact, you don't know what a 
clue is. you couldn't get a clue if I turned you loose with a clue net in 
a field full of rutting clues.

No one cares whether you like Tori Amos or not. You don't like her. That's
fine. We're all perfectly happy with that. It doesn't bother the universe.
What bothers people is your attitude. You're the loud obnoxious jerk who 
has wandered in and crashed a party. We all sit around and say to each 
other "Lord, what an asshole." Some of us take the time to say, "Um, 
would you please take the lampshade off your head and get your hand out 
of the hostess's blouse?" But you're too far gone to hear us.

As of yet, none of us is quite ready to take you out back and shoot you, 
we are just waiting for you to get bored and go away.

You're no Kate fan. You're no Kate maniac. You don't know what a Kate
maniac is. If you had the slightest clue (which you never will), the
slightest understanding of the nature of the woman for whom you purport to
have so much esteem you would never speak to people the way you do without
provocation. Being a fan of someone does not give you the license to be
rude and demeaning to everyone else, and it is especially ludicrous when
you claim to be a fan of Kate Bush, who is known in both her work and
personal life as someone who is unflaggingly polite and sensitive to
others, even those who differ with her. 

You spew out your inane pseudo-artsy doggerel and try to sound
oh-so-ethereal, but when you speak to someone in your own voice the truth
is more than plain.

I don't know if Kate would be polite to you right now. The above message 
was as polite as I could manage. This is my _GET OUT OF MY HOUSE_!!
