Here is the much-requested full text of the article on EMI's multimedia 
program, complete with one reference to Kate. Apologies in advance for 
typos -- do your best.

New York Business Wire - May 23, 1995 -- EMI announces new 5-point 
multimedia strategy: +Creative Alliances with Multimedia Software 
Developers, +Technology Venture with Apple Computer, +Releases of Long 
Form CD-Roms and Enhanced CDs, +Continuing Program of Video CD Releases, 
+Continuing Rollout of Internet Sites.

EMI Music President and CEO Jim Fifield today announced a creative 
strategy and global initiatives to further build upon EMI's position in 
multimedia.  

Creative Alliances with Software DEvelopers:  EMI will combine its braod 
range of repertoire with the cutting edge talents of some of the hottest 
multimedia software developers.  In line with this strategy, EMI today 
announced that it has: +entered into a creative alliance with Virgin 
Interactive Entertainment, one of the worlds leading developers of CD-Rom 
entertainment products, to work with EMI artists to develop, manufacture, 
and distribute full-length interactive CD-Rom titles; +entered into a 
creative alliance with Von Holtzbrinch Group, one of the world's premiere 
publishers, to develop, manufacture, and distribute full length 
interactive CD-Rom reference and resource titles utilizing EMI repertoire 
[aside from Karen -- does that mean a Kate Bush Encyclopaedia?].  

In a related development, EMI Records Group North America has reached an 
agreement with Virgin Interactive etc. under which Virgin will distribute 
EMI's Enhanced CD releases through software retailers in North America.  

+Technology Venture with Apple: EMI is forming a technology venture with 
Apple Computer, under which Apple will provide a state of the art 
multimedia studio and technical staff at EMI's famed Abbey Road Studios 
(where Kate sometimes works).  This unique studio will bring togetehr 
cutting edge recording and multimedia technology.  In addition, Apple 
will supply and support a number of additional CD-ROM authoring stations 
for Virgin and EMI companies throughout the world.  The studio and 
development stations will provide artists with the most comprehensive adn 
technologically advanced facilities and tools to support their multimedia 
projects. 

One of the principal aims of the venture is to speed the introduction of 
the new Enhanced CD format.  To that end, the two companies will be 
coopreating on the development of Enhanced CD titles.  

+Enhanced CD Releases/CD-ROM: EMI plans to release a full slate of long 
form CD-ROM and Enhanced CD titles from various labels, beginning with 
releases from Rolling Stones and Queensryche.  

In the early autumn, Virgin Records will be releasing its first fully 
interactive CD-ROM title from The Rolling Stones, based upon the 
Grammy-winning audio release "Voodoo Lounge."  The Rolling Stones have 
been fully involved in development of the title which includes specially 
filmed footage of all band members, new footage from the tour, 
spectacular on-stage shots and new mixes of the album tracks.  In the 
U.S. the program will be distributed to software outlets by GTE 
Interactive and to record retail through EMI's distribution arm, CEMA.

This summer EMI Records Group North America will be releasing its first 
fully interactive CD-ROM title "Promised Land" from the multi-platinum 
artist, Queensryche.  "Promosed Land" is an exciting set of interactive 
games based upon the music of the group's platinum album of the same 
name.  

(cut boring text about how wonderful EMI is)

EMI will be continuing its highly successful program of Video CD releases 
from some of its most important artists.  To date EMI has released titles 
from such artists as Pink Floyd, Tina Turner, David Bowie, KATE BUSH, and 
Queen, with further releases planned for Duran Duran, Beastie Boys, Pet 
Shop Boys, Pink Floyd, NIGEL KENNEDY, Cliff Richard and Barbara Hendricks.

Internet:  EMI will continue to expand its presence in Cyberspace with 
the creation of a number of additional Internat sites for its labels and 
artists.

(cut boring text about how hip EMI is for having an Adam Ant site.)

The Internet creates an opportunity for record consumers to interact 
directly with artists and their music -- furthering the bond between EMI 
artists and their fans. (Now that's more like it.)  

Opportunities for Artists:  "We are excited by the broad range of 
opportunities multimedia opens up for our artists," said Fifield.  
"Combining the strength of EMI's repertoire with the creative talents and 
technological capabilities of major multimedia companies is a perfect way 
to move forward in this exciting new arena.  We consider the initiatives 
announced today to be just the first steps in bringing a wide range of 
innovative music and artist-driven multimedia to our consumers around the 
world."

(cut more speeches from various EMI heads about how wonderful multimedia is.)

Ken Berry, Chairman and CEO of Virgin/EMI International said, "We believe 
that music will play a critical role in the multimedia revolution.  
Multimedia projects create intriguing opportunities for our artists to 
explore their creativity.  CD-ROMs are about more than just putting 
videos to existing music.  Weare pleased that through these initiatives 
we will have the resources to provide our artists with a gateway to a 
broad range of multimedia possibilities."
