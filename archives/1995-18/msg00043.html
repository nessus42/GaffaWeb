Hi, my name is Karen Rogers and I recently started using a magazine
subscription club in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription deal
with your first paid order- and I have been very pleased with them.    They
have over 1,500 different USA titles that they can ship to any country on a
subscription basis.  They saved me a lot of money on my Economist
subscription:  over $40 off the best subscription price on I had seen
anywhere else and they got me a great deal on USA Today newspaper, which
arrives the same day as the cover date.  (I still don't know how they manage
to do that!)

They will send you some FREE info. via E-mail (the short version (around 40K)
of their catalogue, or if you request it the DELUXE LONG VERSION (around
400K-big and juicey) !)...if you fill out the form below.

Please do not email me as I am just a happy customer and a *busy* student.  I
don't have time to even complete my thesis in time, let alone run my
part-time software business!  Email them directly at:
       julie12@freenet.fsu.edu

REQUEST FOR MORE INFO:  please copy this section *only* and email to:
                                  julie12@freenet.fsu.edu

(sorry, but they cannot acknowledge incomplete forms sent back)

They guarantee to beat all their competitors' prices. Sometimes they are less
than half of the next best deal I have been able to find and other times,
just a little cheaper - but I have never found a lower rate yet.  They
assured me that if I ever do, they will beat it.

They have been very helpful and helped me change my address from the USA to
Finland and then back again when I moved last month.  They are very
knowledgeable about addressing mags worldwide.

They have a deal where you can get a free 1 yr. sub to a new magazine from a
special list of over 300 popular titles published in the USA.   They will
give you this free 1 yr. sub when you place your first paid order with them
to a renewal or new subscription to any of the over 1,500 different popular
USA titles they sell.

They can arrange delivery to virtually any country and I think they have
clients in around 35 or 36 countries now.  Outside the USA there is a charge
for foreign postage and handling (on both paid and freebie subs) that varies
from magazine to magazine.  I have found their staff to be very friendly and
courteous.  They even helped me with an address change when I moved from one
country to another.

The owner thinks of his service as a "club" and his clients as "members"
(even though there is no extra fee to become a member - your first purchase
automatically makes you a member) and he is real picky about who he accepts
as a new member.   When he sets you up as a new member, he himself calls you
personally on the phone to explain how he works his deal, or sometimes he has
one of his assistants call.  He is kind of quirky sometimes - he insists on
setting up new members by phone so he can say hi to everyone (I sure wouldn't
want to have his phone bills!),  but you can place future orders (after your
first order) via E-mail.

He has some really friendly young ladies working for him, who seem to know
just as much as he does about this magazine stuff.  If you live overseas, he
will even call you there, as long as you are interested, but I think he still
makes all his overseas calls on the weekends, I guess cause the long distance
rates are cheaper then.

He only likes to take new members from referrals from satisfied existing
members and he does virtually no advertising- so you can email me and I will
forward your message on to him as a referral.   When I got set-up, they had a
2-3 week waiting list for new members to be called back so that they could
join up. (Once you are an existing member, they help you immediately when you
call. )  I think they are able to get back to prospective new members  the
same day or within a few days now, as they have increased their staff.  I am
not sure about this.........but if you email the above form to them, that is
the way to get started!

They will send you some FREE info. via E-mail (the short version (around 40K)
of their catalogue, or if you request it the DELUXE LONG VERSION (around
400K-big and juicey) !)...if you fill out the form near the top of this
message.

They then send you email  that outlines how his club works and the list of
free choices that you can choose from, as well as the entire list of what he
sells;  and then they will give you a quick (3-5 minute) friendly,
no-pressure no-obligation call to explain everything to you personally and
answer all your questions.

Here is a list of some of the 1500+ titles that they sell (for your free
selection with your first paid order, approximately one-fifth of these appear
on their special freebies list).
