Hi!

as promised a few moments ago, here's an excerpt of the current version of
the discography (still needing time to be completed). If you want an updated
version of this list, feel free to email me.

Bye,

Uli

P.S.: This list is not pure fiction, more than half of them do exist, for I do
own them, and I've even seen quite a few of the others myself. My purse is
actually happy about me not being able to find too many other sampler albums
anymore :-).
