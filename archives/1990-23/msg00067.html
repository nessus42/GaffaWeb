	G'day this is my first posting ever so forgive any mistakes!

&gt;Really-From: prince@pawl.rpi.edu (Ron Buckmire)

&gt;Should I get "The Whole Story" as my first Kate Bush album if I want to find out
&gt; kind of stuff she does? I liked "Love And Anger" and "The Sensual World" and
&gt;"This Woman's Work" fro her last album but that was it. [i heard it didn't buy
&gt;it.] Should I buy "The Whole Story"? Is it a good compilation CD?
&gt;-- 

	In answer to this question I would have to say Yes! On TWS is a
new vocal version of Wuthering Heights. If you have been reading gaffa for a
while you may have noticed some discussion about this particular version. I
much prefer the original version found on TKI (The Kick Inside) her first
album. Most who have posted to this group have been of the same mind.

	As far as the songs you mentioned being a good indication of what 
Kate's music is like, it depends! There was a HUGE discussion a while back on
gaffa about this. The general consensus was that If you were introduced to 
Kate at the early stage of her career the you'd like TSW (no flames please).
I take it therefore that if you like TSW then it is possible you probably 
like her earlier music.

	First I bought TWS. Having heard Kate way back in '78 with Wuthering 
Heights and Man With The Child in His Eyes, I immediately fell in love with 
Kate's music (not to mention Kate as well). But as I was only young I didn't
buy any of her stuff (not a good excuse eh!). Until last year with TWS.

	As an album in its own right it does give you a broad spectrum of 
Kate's music. Put it this way: If after listening to it you don't fall in love
with Kate and her music, you never will! 

	Consequently after buying that album a friend of mine down here in the
'Gong (Wollongong in Australia, If you're reading this, g'day Ogbo) introduced
me to HoL (Hounds Of Love) as well as TKI and TSW. 

	Since then I now have The Dreaming on order and once I have that I'll 
have all of Kate's albums in one form or another. It is from listening to all
the songs on TWS in the context of the individual albums that you get the 
full piKTure. As well, the songs on TWS, IMHO, are a doorway through which 
you enter a world of extreme (superlatives escape me) beauty and Kate!

	After TWS get TKI, you won't be disappointed!

	Her Albums in order if you don't already know:
The Kick Inside
Lionheart
Never Forever
The Dreaming
Hounds of Love
The Whole Story
The Sensual World

	One last note: If ever you get a chance to see the video for Man with
The Child in His Eyes, even if you have to give up a part of your anatomy for
it, DO SO!!! The beginning is sheer beauty. (It's going through my head now!
AHHHH! (sigh of extreme pleasure)). I'm sure most would agree with me on this.

Bye!
