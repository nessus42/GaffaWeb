Ok folks, here it is.  Apologies to the siberry mailing list people who 
already have this.  I only picked up her 'Bound By The Beauty' CD a
couple of days before the gig.  Needless to say I loved her music from
play 1.

Now I have 1 album - any opinions on the next to buy??

Jane Siberry

The venue wasn't packed, but the intimate atmosphere might 
have been disturbed by a truckload of people crammed into the 
cosy confines.  This was the 'Everything Reminds Me Of My Dog' 
tour - a mouthful of a title, which she claimed was not her 
choice.

First sight of the sensual songstress is a solo introduction to a 
Tom Waits song.  Gradually, like the rising sun shedding first 
light, a piano and harmonica grew brighter.  Jane's voice 
undulated, mirroring the harp's lament.  She is in love with life 
- and it showed.  When she sang "Something About Trains", her 
free arm danced with feeling to the honkytonk piano (played by 
Teddy Borowiecki).

The set was similar to a conversation - drawing the audience 
toward the trio, throwing in odd observations on St Kilda beach 
life.  "Hockey" reminded me of an old Christmas carol, where all 
was "deep and crisp and even".  What made this relaxing delivery 
doubly enjoyable was the fact that people were actually 
listening, instead of jabbering through the quiet parts of the 
evening.  Given that most people were newcomers to her music, 
she demonstrated her talent to make people take notice of her 
words.  This doesn't take anything away from the other two 
musicians - Ken Myhr inparticularily, coaxing weird sounds 
from his electric guitar and bouncing Sangria flavoured notes 
from his Spanish acoustic.

 Half way through the set, Jane called up John Matthews from 
the audience (the guy who busks with a didgeridoo outside IDs 
every gig night).  This impromptu guest certainly took the band 
aback with his bizarre (to them) instrument enhancing their 
countrified, laid back style.  Following with a beautiful 
rendition of "Bound By The Beauty", I swear people were 
beginning to melt into their chairs by the warmth radiating 
from the stage.

After the obligatory break, they played a short encore of 
"Calling All Angels" and "Taxi Ride".  These Canadians seemed 
quite embarrassed to be cheered back - a contrast to the recent 
Maple Leaf visitors, The Pursuit Of Happiness.  Her name has
been mentioned in the same breath as Laurie Anderson, and Kate 
Bush.  She does not like to be categorized or labeled, but 
without a reference point, some people are lost - so I'd dare to 
say her vocal style is closer to Joni Mitchell, without being 
derivative in material.   The total experience of the band was 
positively blissful.

Brian May.
