 Subject: Copy of a letter to EMI from Derek Langsford and Andrew Marvick 

     What follows below is the final draft of a letter co-written by
Derek Langsford and IED on the subject of EMI's plan to release a
boxed set of Kate Bush compact discs. It has been sent off
to EMI's Manchester Square offices.

Steve Davis,
Product Manager,
EMI Records Ltd.,
20 Manchester Square,
London, W1A 1ES,
England, UK


	                                                       4th September, 1990

Dear Mr. Davis,
	                Re : _The Kate Bush CD Box Set_

	We recently learned that EMI has at long last decided to release a collection 
of Kate Bush b-sides, non-LP tracks and other rarities on compact disc, in a 
box set which would also include all of Kate's albums.  Even more recently 
Peter FitzGerald-Morris (Editor of _Homeground_ Magazine, England's official 
Kate Bush fanzine) listed the projected non-album tracks of EMI's forthcoming 
collection.  Naturally, all of Kate's fans were happy to learn of the plan to 
make Kate's non-LP recordings available on compact disc.  We and many other 
fans however, were _extremely_ disappointed to discover that the material 
selected for release was so limited in scope.  The package, as described in 
Peter's report, seems to make little market or artistic sense.  We are writing 
to you now to make a number of suggestions which we hope you will consider 
before finalizing your plans for the collection.
	We offer first a list of important additions to the non-LP track listing.  
Below that we offer a suggested alternative track listing for the entire 
collection: one which we feel would be far more satisfactory than the present 
plan.  We hope you will see that this approach would be a much better 
commercial proposition than what seems to be on the drawing board at the 
moment.


_Non-Album Recordings for the Collection_

	We were very pleased, of course, to see that EMI do plan to include all of 
the releases from EMI's non-LP Kate Bush catalogue.  These are:

	1.)  The Empty Bullring
	2.)  Ran Tan Waltz 
	3.)  Passing Through Air 
	4.)  December Will Be Magic Again (single mix) 
	5.)  Warm and Soothing 
	6.)  Lord of the Reedy River 
	7.)  Dreamtime 
	8.)  Ne T'enfuis pas  
	9.)  Un Baiser d'enfant 
	10.)  The Man With the Child in His Eyes (single mix) 
	11.)  Under the Ivy 
	12.)  My Lagan Love 
	13.)  The Handsome Cabin Boy 
	14.)  Burning Bridge 
	15.)  Not This Time 
	16.)  Running Up That Hill (extended remix) 
	17.)  Running Up That Hill (instrumental) 
	18.)  Hounds of Love (Alternative Hounds remix) 
	19.)  The Big Sky (Meteorological mix) 
	20.)  Cloudbusting (Organon mix) 
	21.)  Experiment IV 
	22.)  Experiment IV (extended remix) 
	23.)  Wuthering Heights (new vocal version) 
	24.)  The Sensual World (instrumental) 
	25.)  Walk Straight Down the Middle 
	26.)  I'm Still Waiting 
	27.)  Be Kind to My Mistakes (single remix) 
	28.)  Ken (G.L.C.) 
	29.)  The Confrontation (G.L.C.) 
	30.)  One Last Look Around the House Before We Go... 
	31.)  Them Heavy People (live) 
	32.)  Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake (live) 
	33.)  James and the Cold Gun (live) 
	34.)  L'Amour Looks Something Like You (live) 

	These thirty four tracks constitute Kate Bush's total official "b-side" and 
non-LP catalogue output on EMI.  *It does not, however, constitute anything 
like the total number of non-LP recordings which Kate has made to date, and 
which have still not been released on compact disc by EMI*.  Here is a 
supplementary list of _indispensible_ non-LP tracks and rarities by Kate Bush 
which we fervently hope you will include in your compilation:

1.)  _Maybe_. 
	This is the first of two known demo recordings of this song which Kate wrote 
long before signing with EMI.  Kate herself played an excerpt from this 
recording on the BBC radio programme  "Personal Call" in 1979, and Kate Bush 
fans have been treasured that excerpt ever since.  The song is a favorite 
among many fans, and its exclusion from your compilation would be sorely 
missed.
2. and 3.)  _The Long and Winding Road_  and _She's Leaving Home_. 
	Both from a pre-recorded television performance which Kate made on the 
Japanese television variety programme "Sound in 'S'" on June 23rd, 1978.
4.)  _Another Day_. 
	This is a duet of the Roy Harper song which Kate recorded with Peter Gabriel 
for her BBC television special "Kate" in December 1979.  Kate fans count this 
as a particular favorite.
5.)  _Ibiza_. 
	This recording of a song co-written by Kate and Peter Gabriel was originally 
intended as the b-side of the projected "Another Day" single which was, 
unfortunately, never released.
6.)  _The Magician_.
	This is a song by Maurice Jarre with lyrics by Paul Webster which Kate 
recorded for the soundtrack to the film "The Magician of Lublin", starring 
Alan Arkin.  Kate Bush fans have long suffered with nothing except the 
soundtrack as dubbed off of video-tapes of the film.  The soundtrack has never 
been released on record, let alone on compact disc.  This song is absolutely 
indispensible to any serious compilation of Kate Bush rarities.

7 and 8.)  _Breathing (live)_  and  _Do Bears Sh.. in the Woods? (live)_.
	These two songs were released as part of the "Comic Relief" album, "Ha! Ha! 
Ha! Utterly Utterly Live" which included excerpts from the live "Comic Relief" 
shows of April 4-6, 1986.  The former track is a live solo performance by Kate 
of the song from her Never For Ever album; the latter track is a live duet 
with Rowan Atkinson of a comic song written specially for the occasion.
9.)  _Be Kind to My Mistakes (original soundtrack-album version)_. 
	Longer and much different from the version which was released as a b-side 
from the This Woman's Work twelve-inch single and CD-single.  This alternate, 
early version of the song was released--though never on compact disc--as part 
of the EMI soundtrack album from the Nicolas Roeg film  "Castaway". 
10.)  _Brazil_. 
	This is a vocal version of the old popular song which Terry Gilliam used as 
the main theme for his film, "Brazil".  Kate recorded this version to an 
orchestral arrangement by Michael Kamen as part of a collection of tracks 
which were originally planned for a soundtrack album of Gilliam's film.  For 
undisclosed reasons it was never released.  Kate's fans have wanted to hear 
this recording ever since.
11.)  _Cloudbusting (the video mix)_. 
	This is the version of "Cloudbusting" which Kate recorded for her video of 
the song.  It includes a section of completely new and exclusive music.
12.)  _Running Up That Hill (live)_. 
	This live performance was released on the album "Amnesty International's 
Secret Policeman's Third Ball: The Music". 
13.)  _Rocket Man_. 
	This is a cover version of the Elton John/Bernie Taupin song which Kate 
recorded for inclusion in a compilation album by various artists, in tribute 
to the twentieth anniversary of the songwriting team of John and Taupin.  For 
undisclosed reasons that album was never released, but Kate's fans have long 
coveted this recording.
14-17.)  _G.L.C.--the Four Missing Tracks_. 
	These four short tracks are instrumental and choral pieces which Kate 
recorded for or gathered together to include in an episode of the "Comic 
Strip" television series called  "G.L.C."  Three other tracks from this, the 
only Kate Bush filmscore, were included as b-sides on the twelve-inch single 
and CD-single of Love and Anger, but these remaining four bits of music were 
sadly omitted from any official EMI release.  As they are particularly 
beautiful recordings, their inclusion in the planned collection is eagerly 
anticipated by fans.

	As you can see there is more material than might have been initially 
considered.  Each of the pieces is essential to any attempt to produce a 
"complete Kate Bush compilation" on CD.  Nor does the preceding list 
constitute the sum of rare and sought-after Kate Bush rarities.  In addition, 
we strongly urge EMI to consider releasing a definitive, full-length compact 
disc recording of Kate's entire Tour of Life concert.  Heretofore fans have 
had to make do with the four-song EP _On Stage_, and the video-cassette, _Kate 
Bush Live on Stage at the Hammersmith Odeon_, which contained twelve songs 
from Kate's twenty-five-song set.  Of particular interest to fans are the 
wonderful snatches of special music and poetry which were performed in between 
many of the songs which Kate performed on stage; and the extraordinary early 
version of _Egypt_, which differs greatly from the album version.
	EMI might also want to include two other rare live performances by Kate: her 
rendition of _Blow Away_ at the 75th Anniversary concert of the London 
Symphony Orchestra; and her live performance of _The Wedding List_  from the 
Prince's Trust Gala concert of 1982.



_The Box Set Configuration_ 

	We think we speak for all Kate Bush fans--certainly those who belong to the 
U.S.  organizations Love-Hounds and The American Kate Bush Society--when we 
say that we are already very grateful to EMI and Kate for at last putting 
together her b-sides and rarities as a compact-disc collection.  If you take 
the time to find room for most of the recordings discussed above, we are very 
sure the Kate Bush fan community will respond by buying them in record 
numbers.
	To accomplish this, however, the box set must be planned in a way that will 
make it attractive to all the fans who already own Kate's albums on individual 
CDs.  Frankly, we have already heard complaints and doubts from other fans 
concerning the set as proposed by EMI.  These fans are put off by the prospect 
of having to duplicate their collection of album CDs simply in order to 
acquire the non-LP collection.
	In an attempt to satisfy both EMI's plans for a superior product and the 
fans' desire for a truly comprehensive and priceworthy collection, we have 
come up with the following design for the programme of the proposed boxed set 
of compact discs.

Discs 1 to 6 : _The Albums_.
	First and most importantly, each of the album CDs should include several 
bonus tracks.  This makes the new discs of the albums different from their 
original editions and adds greatly to their collectibility among those many 
fans who already own the album CDs.  Naturally, the choice and sequence of 
these bonus tracks should complement the albums to which they are attached.  
Another advantage of this plan is that it gives EMI the alternative of either 
reducing the overall number of discs required for the collection of non-LP 
tracks, or (our preference, of course) adding greatly to the number of 
rarities in the collection.  Above all, however, this plan makes optimal use 
of the enlarged capacity of the digital medium.
		The booklets for these discs should be special editions, designed 
exclusively for the boxed set.  They should include lyrics of the bonus songs 
and an indication of where the songs came from.

Disc 7: _The Whole Story Volume Two_
	In a boxed set which already includes all of Kate's studio albums, the 
inclusion of the original greatest-hits LP, _The Whole Story_, would obviously 
be redundant.  We propose an alternative: a new disc which would compile all 
of Kate's single releases which were not  included in the original edition of 
_The Whole Story_, including all of the alternate mixes of the Hounds of Love 
singles, and, updated with the singles from Kate's most recent album, The 
Sensual World.  The new compilation could be called _The Whole Story Volume 
Two_. 
		There is another advantage to this plan.  With the original singles 
collection, _The Whole Story_, already available, a separate, single-disc 
release of The Whole Story Volume Two would make an excellent companion 
release for the more limited-edition boxed set.  Essentially an update of 
Kate's singles output, _The Whole Story Volume Two_ would give "Greatest Hits" 
collectors something to buy as a companion to the original _The Whole Story_.  
Its inclusion in the boxed set might very well entice more people to buy the 
complete boxed set, particularly as the boxed set would not contain _The Whole 
Story_ (1).and would actually compliment it.
		The booklet could be similar in style to that for the original _The Whole 
Story_. 

Disc 8 : _The Uncollected Rarities_.
	A disc of the extra songs that do not fit in with the album work or b-side 
songs with a booklet explaining their source and lyrics.  


Disc 9: _The Tour of Life_.
	A full CD of live recordings from the video soundtrack as well as additional 
songs which were edited out of the video release, Live at the Hammersmith 
Odeon.


	Here now are our suggested track listings for the entire set of nine compact 
discs, which are comprised of the six albums (each with its own set of 
historically related bonus tracks), the collection of additional rarities, the 
second volume of _The Whole Story_, and the expanded album of live recordings

	21.)  At the Grave Site  (from the Comic Strip episode "G.L.C.")


Disc 9: _The Tour of Life_
 
	A full CD's worth from the 1979 tour--in other words, all twelve tracks from 
the original home-video release, plus four or five additional 
tracks--particularly Egypt,  which is of great interest because the live 
version is quite different from the album version. 

	All discs would be under 75 minutes long.

	In addition to the special booklets for each individual disc, there should be 
a special, separate booklet containing a detailed official EMI discography, 
photos, brief comments explaining the relation of the albums to their 
respective bonus-tracks, and a chronology or brief biographical 
piece--possibly contributed by Kate herself.


	We believe it's important that the set should be made attractive in every 
possible way--not only through good design and artwork, but also through the 
inclusion of new booklets and the exploitation of the compact disc's longer 
playing time.  Above all we hope that you will bear in mind that most of 
Kate's fans already own her albums on disc, and that therefore the inclusion 
of all her albums in the new boxed set must be made to seem a worthwhile 
investment--and as we see it, the magic words in this regard are:  *bonus 
tracks*.  Finally, we feel that the simultaneous release of a separate 
single-disc collection  (The Whole Story Volume Two)  would give those who 
couldn't afford the boxed set a more modest alternative that still provided 
considerable interest in its own right.  With the right kind of marketing such 
a collection might also encourage many newcomers to consider buying the entire 
boxed set.
	In closing we'd like to offer you our sincere thanks for making the first and 
most important decision: to release a boxed set of Kate Bush albums.  We urge 
you to consider adopting our ideas for the project.


	                   			Sincerely yours,





	      	Derek Langsford	              	Andrew Marvick
