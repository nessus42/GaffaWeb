The Sept. 1990 issue of _Q_ magazine has an interview with
David Gilmour.  One of the questions is about Kate:

Interviewer:  When you brought Kate Bush to the attention of EMI, you
	      somehow acquired the image of an avuncular helping hand
	      to the next generation. . .
Gilmour:  Did I?  I did do a couple of things with Kate, I suppose.  To
	  a certain extent, if you see something that you think is 
	  brilliant, and particularly if that thing is being presented in
	  such a way that most cloth-eared record company people wouldn't
	  notice if it hit them falling off the top of a truck, then I 
	  sometimes feel a certain sense of responsibility to bring out
	  what I think is good and *then* bring it to their attention,
	  which is what I did with Kate.  Her home demos were of her 
	  sitting at a horrible piano, recorded with a very ancient
	  tape-recorder, and her squeaking away.  I listened to them and I
	  could hear the talent but wouldn't have dreamt of taking them to
	  a record company.  I knew the only way to do it was to tart them
	  up, if you like.  We recorded her properly, with a proper 
	  producer and the best engineer, Geoff Emerick, arranger, and
	  chose three or four songs out of about 50, and made a proper
	  record and presented it to EMI.  And of course they said, Yes,
	  great, we'll take it.

There's also an article about Nigel Kennedy.  I'll just quote one
sentence:

"One wonders how long it will be before 'Nige' -- who has played with
Paul McCartney (who he calls 'Macca') and Kate Bush (who he calls
'Bush Baby' . . . in Nigel's world, as in soccer and, indeed, heavy
metal, everybody must have their nickname) -- will be saying 'Awright,
Carnegie Hall!  Are you ready to rawk?!?' or some such."

Bush Baby?????

Every month _Q_ has a rock'n'roll quiz.  This month it's "Dogs in Rock".
15 pictures of dogs taken from album covers are shown, you have to
say what albums the pictures are from.  Any Love-Hound who takes longer
than one-half second to find the dog from the cover of _Hounds Of Love_
should have his or her membership revoked!  :-)


Ed Suranyi             |  Interviewer:  Most of the women I know who
ed@das.llnl.gov        |                aspire to make a living making
(415) 447-3405         |                music would rather be you then,
3550 Pacific Ave #312  |                say, Madonna.
Livermore, CA  94550   |  Kate:  Oh, really!  Ha!
