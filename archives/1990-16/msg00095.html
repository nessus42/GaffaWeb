After reviewing my videotape of miscellaneous TV appearances I've
compiled  the following list of it's contents, numbers in brackets
denote the timer count at the beginning of the segment.  The dates are
taken from "Kate Bush Complete".

1) [0:00] Kate's December 1978 appearance on SNL ( #2 on Deb's video).

   This includes the introduction, _The Man with the Child in His
   Eyes_, _Them Heavy People_ and the closing.  About the "shooting up" 
   gesture, wellll ok, I'll agree that it looks that way but I suspect 
   that it really has little bearing on the intent of the lyrics.  

2) [0:08] A portion of the official Army Dreamers video.

3) [0:10] _December Will Be Magic Again_ from the December, 1979
   BBC "Winter Snowtime Special" ( #6 on Deb's video).

4) [0:13] An unidentified British TV show discussing Kate's dance
   training. 

   This shows Kate rehearsing the _Sat in Your Lap_ routine with
   her dance partners.  This may be the BBC "Looking Good, Feeling Fit"
   appearance from August 1981.  The unseen interviewer remarks on her
   "rubber trousers" (actually nylon warmup pants) and the interview
   confirms the shocking fact that she does indeed "get spots."  Kate
   notes that she doesn't dance to keep fit, keeping fit is just a
   result of her love for dance.  

5) [0:17] The appearance on the "Razzamataz" children's show, July 
   1981 ( #9 on Deb's video ).

   This is the appearance where Kate discusses the making of the _Sat
   In Your Lap_ video.

6) [0:27] The Russel Harty show appearance, November, 1980 ( #8/#13 on
   Deb's video.)  
   
   My version starts with an introduction at the beginning of the show 
   in which Harty, wearing boxing gloves and headgear, requires Kate to 
   promise not to harm him in any way, listing a variety of means which 
   oddly enough include "touch," and "kiss".  Kate does so sheepishly 
   while hiding a wooden mallet behind her back.  I guess you have to 
   be a regular viewer to get the joke...

   It then cuts to the Delius video &lt;sigh&gt; continuing on into the
   interview with Kate and Eric Fenby.

7) [0:32] The "Friday Night Saturday Morning" show, hosted by Dr.
   Desmond Morris, November 1981 (evidently #16 on Deb's video).

   This is indeed and excellent interview.  To clarify the remark that
   Vickie noted: "I always find watching you sing - because you do
   more than listen to you, you watch very much as well when you're 
   performing - I always find I feel like a mouse confronted with a
   cobra because there's something hypnotic about it, it's very
   strange.  Can you explain it?   It's some sort of curious lilt 
   you get into your voice which is almost like a incantation.  Where
   did it come from?"  "Well, Ssssssssssssssss is the obvious one isn't 
   it?" says Kate.

   Dr. Morris asks her how she sees her art developing and Kate tells
   him that it would definitely develop on stage.  &gt;sigh&lt; 

8) [0:40] "The Old Grey Whistle Test" talk show appearance, August
   1982 (#18 on Debs video).  
   
   This features the first airing of _The Dreaming_ video.  Vickie 
   accurately characterized the two hosts as "The Twit Twins".

9) [0:48] The _There Goes A Tenner_ performance from "Razzamataz",
   September 1982 (#19 on Deb's video).

   I had noted before that I don't think that this performance was up
   to Kate's usual standards, IED counters by calling it "absolutely
   _brilliant_, _genius_ work" and suggests that I watch it several 
   more times through.  
   
   Well, I have.  To me there's no question that this performance is
   sub-par.  Kate's concept and choreography are up to her usual 
   standards but the performance just doesn't work well, as though
   they needed maybe another hour or two of rehearsal before the 
   shoot.  Preferably not in a box car :-).  Add to that some terrible 
   camera work and those cheesey special affects and I doubt that you 
   have something that Kate would be happy with.

10) [0:51]  The "Delia Smith's Cookery Course" appearance (for which I
    can't locate a date).  (#12 on Deb's video).

    Kate notes that a mixture of nuts and sunflower seeds roasted in 
    soy sauce normally used to garnish salads can be eaten alone 
    although "It makes you feel a bit like a parrot." 

11) [0:56] The "Kate" BBC special, December 1979.

    This is simply great.  I'll try to summarize.

    It opens with a performance of _Violin_ very much like the tour 
    routine.   Kate wears a spiffy black outfit something like the 
    one pictured on the back of _Never For Ever_.

    Next is _Symphony in Blue_ with Kate at the piano.  "Good for the
    blood circulation."  This is followed by the standard _Them Heavy 
    People_ routine pretty much as seen in the video, complete with
    zippered blouse and slit skirt.

    Peter Gabriel does a song by himself at a keyboard of some sort
    prior to an interesting routine for _Ran Tan Waltz_.  Kate is
    dressed as a man with her hair hidden in a hat and fake beard.
    There are two other people in the routine, both men, one dressed as a
    woman and the other as a baby.  The routine is vigorous enough
    that by the it's end Kate has lost both her hat and her beard.

    Kate does _December Will Be Magic Again_, once again performing 
    on the piano.

    The routine that follows for _Wedding List_ seems to have been
    done live with some taped footage edited in.  The setting is in
    the old west and once again Kate presents us with her own special
    brand of poetic violence.

    The duet of _Another Day_ with Peter Gabriel is performed at a
    small table with Kate and Peter playing the couple from the song.
    Images of the couple appearing on the wall behind them.

    Kate does a lip-sync of _Egypt_ dressed in middle eastern 
    style garb and dancing in front of scenes of Egypt.  One
    interesting feature of Kate's outfit is a black band that
    stretches across her face, covering her nose.  At first I thought
    this was supposed to be some sort of strange veil-like thing that
    wouldn't cover her mouth but it's more likely intended to hide her
    nose, presenting a sphinx-like visage.

    Next comes _The Man with the Child in His Eyes_.  Kate is again at
    the piano.  A small image of her performing her standard
    choreography for the song is superimposed to appear to be sitting
    on the piano.

    The show closes with _Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake_,
    performed pretty much the same as in the tour.  

12) [1:40] Part of "Kate Bush in Concert", a German show that includes
    clips from tour and an interview done in April 1980.

    Unfortunately this is only fifteen minutes out of a forty-five
    minute show.  It does include a clips _Strange Phenomena_ and
    _Room for the Life_ from the Tour.

13) [1:55] The _Don't Give Up_ video with Kate and Peter Gabriel.
