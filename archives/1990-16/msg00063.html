Vickie:


In article &lt;9005300543.AA28426@world.std.com&gt; you write:
&gt;
&gt;Lots of people said they didn't understand why I posted my playlists when
&gt;no one could hear the show. "Recognition Factor" is the answer.
&gt;1) If you saw artists and songs on the lists that you recognized and liked,
&gt;   you would be more likely to trust my taste in the things you'd never 
&gt;   heard or heard of.
&gt;2) If you saw a name on my list, you might get a spark of recognition if
&gt;   you saw the name elsewhere.

&gt;Thanks to those who have taken the time to read my playlists. Thanks to
&gt;those who have actually gone out and bought things on my recommendation.
&gt;Hope you liked them. 
 

THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU.

I'm gonna miss the weekly postings of the play lists.  To say nothing of
your insightful comments into KaTe and the meanings of her songs!

I also have you and "Suspended in Gaffa" to thank for Jane Siberry.  
I kept hearing her name on .gaffa, but had never heard Jane.  Then I saw
a video from BbtB on VH1 and thought "Oh.  Interesting."  Then I read
one of your playslists on which you'd played something from "No Borders
Here."  A few days later, I was in a record store exchanging some CDs I'd
gotten for my birthday.  Since I wasn't paying for the discs I wanted something
I might not ordinarily buy without hearing first.  I went to the Jane section
and found 3 or 4 albums.  I recognized the name "No Borders Here" and
on your 'suggestion', I picked that one.

THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU

Hope things work out in Chicago for you and Chris.

Jeff
