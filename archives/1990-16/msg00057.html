Re: "Suspended In Gaffa" radio show (Vickie's playlists)

Chris and I are moving to Chicago in late June so the show will be
ending. The last show will air June 18, 1990. 
My first show aired March 13, 1988.

It's been an amazing 2+ years. The show came to mean more to me than
I ever could have imagined possible. I put more sweat, love, time,
effort and money into it than anything else I'll probably ever do in
my life.

When I started out, I had around 20 CDs, 100 records and a handful of
cassettes by female artists.
I now have over 250 CDs, approx. 800 albums and a couple hundred cassettes
by female artists. Of course, quite of few of those are nearly useless.
Time after time I ended up buying things that were awful, or only had one
or two good songs on them. I came more and more to appreciate artists who
cared about quality and innovation, artists who were unwilling to release
albums with a lot of filler. I came to appreciate artists who had the
imagination to write lyrics that were meaningful, interesting and different
from the same old sappy love/lack of love songs that comprise 99% of the
lyrics that you hear on the radio. I have a lot of respect for women who
write their own music, but that respect is dimmed when they take no time
at all on their lyrics, when their lyrics are interchangable with nearly
everyone else's.
