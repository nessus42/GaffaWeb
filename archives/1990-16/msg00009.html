&gt; Many people sez:
&gt;
&gt; Head's we're dancing...weird lyrics...plastic coins...
&gt;

Larry... sez:

No, no, no, NO!!!  You didn't see the VH-FUN interview where she explains
the original lyrics to and title of the song.  Like "The Sensual World", 
this one underwent revisions as well, also due largely to legal pressure.

	"Well, originaly it was called, "Head, We're Dancing", and was
	 about going to the Junior Prom, and then Tipper Gore called me
	 and said that we couldn't use those lyrics or they'd put stickers
	 on the records, so we changed it to "Heads Were Dancing" and
	 made it a tribute to Mary, Queen of Scots, but then the Royal
	 family called me and said that we couldn't use those lyrics or
	 they'd put stickers on our arses, and I was very distressed,
	 naturally, as Del had come up with this terrific Fairlight 
	 pattern, and a remake of "The Man With The Child In His Eyes"
	 with that drum sequence was right out.  But then inspiration hit.
	 The Trio was in for a last overdub on "Deeper Understanding"
	 when one of them dropped a glob of babka on the track sheet,
	 and wouldn't you know, it stuck right between the "e" and the
	 "r" in "Were", and all of a sudden I recalled the episode about
	 Oppenheimer and it all fell right into place after that.  Talk
	 about "strange phenomena", eh?"

					- Kate "I don't know no stinkin'
						George" Bush, on VH-FUN,
						as transcribed by yours
						truly...
