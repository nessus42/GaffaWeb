ARG!  Apparently we don't have the same tape after all, Deb.  You've
got several things that aren't on my tape and I think I recall some
bits from mine that aren't on yours.  I just hope that the quality
of your video is every bit as poor as mine so that I need not be 
jealous.

A few remarks on your remarks...

&gt; 8)  "Delius"  This is by far one of the lovliest things I've ever seen
&gt; Kate do.  The background of the video is very lush and green, and is
&gt; slightly "hazy", making it look like a very hot, humid summer's day.
&gt; Up above Kate and to the left, is "Old Man Summer", sitting up in a
&gt; wheelchair with a rug over his knees.  He's sporting a smoking jacket
&gt; and a bright yellow sun mask.  

Of course, "Old Man Summer" is intended to represent Delius himself.

&gt; The effect, overall and in a
&gt; word, is heavenly.  I like the video better each time I watch it.

Agreed, I think I asked this the first time we mentioned it but
evidently either no one knew or they were to busy sniping at one
another to say -- where is this from?  Does it exist in any form
besides hoary old videos taped off TV?  

&gt; 11)  "Them Heavy People" -- this is what I like to refer to as the
&gt; "light bulb" version of this song, in which the bulb slowly swings back
&gt; and forth above Kate at the song's opening.  Kate is wearing a straw
&gt; fedora hat, with a figure-flattering black T-shirt, a magenta satin
&gt; skirt, and heels.  The only thing I don't like about this version is
&gt; that they cut out the little chair-smashing scene which ensues between
&gt; Kate and the two male dancers.

This is the video found on _The Single File_.  It seems like the song
was redone, or at least remixed for this video since it has a much
more 'live' sound.  Maybe it was recorded live with the performance
but that's hard to believe since the audio is so clean and I don't
recall seeing any mikes.

The chair smashing scene is just one more example of... "KTean 
Violence" I guess I'll call it, which I fully intend to do an 
essay on someday.  Basically it consists of a sort of poetic
or stylized violence. "People getting their heads blown off very 
beautifully in slow motion," is how  Kate once described what I'm
talking about.  

&gt; 12)  Cooking show -- I mentioned this once before in Love-Hounds, but
&gt; for those of you who missed it, this clip features Kate discussing the
&gt; virtues of vegetarianism with the show's hostess.  

Kate, I've seen what you've been eating.  Stop by anytime.  We'll throw
some steaks on the grill and talk about this vegetarian thing.  (Just
a joke, you wacky vegetarians.  You can eat what you like but I'm 
omnivorous! :-) ).

&gt; 13)  Russell Hart TV talk show -- discussion with host and with
&gt; Eric Fenby regarding the Delius video.  Here Kate is wearing a

This is where the Delius video is shown on my tape, they introduce
Kate right after it.
 
&gt; WHEW!  Well, now that my poor fingers are numb from all this typing,
&gt; I guess it's time to send this off to Love-Hounds so the rest of you
&gt; can enjoy reading all this!
 
Very interesting, thanks Deb.  I plan on watching the tape that I have 
sometime this week so if I can I'll post a list of what's on it.
