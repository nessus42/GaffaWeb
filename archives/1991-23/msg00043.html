Here is the version of the digest-digest I've just sent off to Tom at
C-Side.  He will be redistributing it next week to 500 Katefans worldwide,
so those of you with phone numbers listed, prepare for some calls.  If
you're not on his list for his saliva-inducing (?) list of available
Katestuff, get on it(!): C-Side Records, POB 8456, Clearwater, FL 34618. 
If you want him to white out your phone number ;^), his is 813-461-4327.

I have a slightly longer version of the newsbriefs ready, but no list of
zines &amp;c to send them to... (Suggestions?)
==============================================================

Who are the Love-Hounds?
Love-Hounds is a 5-year-old open-membership fanclub focussed around the
rec.music.gaffa newsgroup on the international computer network called
Usenet,  dedicated to the sublime artistic genius of Kate Bush.   Usenet
connects some 10,000 computers worldwide, allowing each of its ~1,000,000
subscribers to distribute news within minutes or hours to each of the
others.  Gaffa usually carries some dozen messages per day, keeping
"Love-Hounds" as current and connected as any Katefans in the world.

For those with electronic mail capabilities, all r.m.g. postings are also
distributed thru a mailing list.  To subscribe to the mailing list, send a
friendly message to the "moderator", Bill Wisner (who's actually in
Alaska), via: love-hounds-request@eddie.mit.edu  If you have a computer and
modem, there are many ways to connect directly into Usenet-- write to Jorn
for details:  Jorn Barger, PO Box 81988, Chicago IL 60681.   Love-Hound
Richard Caldwell has started a computer bulletin board service that offers
Kate-pix and current r.m.g postings.  The Big Sky BBS can be reached by
modem 24 hours a day at 614-864-1198 (12 or 2400 baud).

As an experiment in Reaching Out to non-Usenet fans, we will be offering on
an experimental basis a monthly (or so) digest of Kate newsbriefs and
comments.  We want to keep this a minimalist venture, so ideally we would
like to send the digest only to clubs, etc that have their own mailing
lists it can be redistributed thru.  Other solutions are possible, though. 
To inquire, contact Jorn.

.........................................................................
Kate on "Suspended in Gaffa": "When I wrote this track the words came at
the same time, and this is one of the few songs where the lyrics were
complete at such an early stage. The idea of the song is that of being
given a glimpse of "God"--something that we dearly want--but being told
that unless we work for it, we will never see it  again, and even then, we
might not be worthy of it. Of course, everybody wants the reward without
the toil, so people try to find a way out of the hard work, still hoping to
claim the prize, but such is not the case. The choruses are meant to
express the feeling of entering timelessness as you become ready for the
experience, but only when you are ready."  (1982, KBC 12)  [Ron Hill
5-13-91]
.........................................................................
In Greek 'gafa' means blunder... [Agathagelos Kyrlidis 5-21-91]

"Kate Bush is God!" (She really IS!)
===================================================================
Newsbriefs from Love-Hounds #1 (edited by Jorn Barger: no copyright but
please give credit to Love-Hounds!)
......................................................................
Q magazine's June edition (number 57) included free sleevenotes for Hounds
Of Love. [Andy Semple]
......................................................................
..from the April 19th issue of R &amp; R (Radio and Records, an industry
rag)...in a report dealing primarily with Prince: ".... The Purple One also
reportedly has lined up some BIG NAMES to to direct videos in support of
the disc, including actress Lisa Bonet, Columbia recording artist Kate
Bush, and noted film maker Spike Lee, who will likely call the shots for
the first single entitled Willing and Able." [Larry Hernandez-- rumor still
unconfirmed!!!]
..................................................................
In the June 1991 edition of VOX magazine they have a reader's top 100. 
Kate appears at the following positions:
#44 Wuthering Heights, #60 The Kick Inside (album), #75 Hounds Of Love
(album), #95 The Dreaming (album). 
	In the May 1991 edition of Record Collector (number 141) they have the
latest top 500 collectable artists. Kate is number 11 this year down from 7
last year. Number 1 is (yes, you guessed it!!) The Beatles.
	The 'Simple Truth ' concert for the Kurds was on the tv last night.  Peter
Gabriel appeared with Sting to do 'Games Without Frontiers' and Sinead
O'Connor joined later to do 'Don't Give Up'.  To be perfectly honest, she
murdered the song,  I don't think it suits her voice. I was disappointed,
as I like her music. [Andy Semple 5-13-91]
.......................................................................
 In the new Music Mart section of Goldmine, one of the ad categories, with
number 5085, is "Kate Bush".  [Ed Suranyi 5-17-91]
In the latest issue of Goldmine, they say that there will be an article on
Kate coming soon.  I think it will be the August 9 issue,
which should go on sale sometime in July.  [Ed Suranyi 6-30-91]
.........................................................................
I am a theater major and I used the words from Never Be Mine as monologue
material...AND GOT A PART!!  I remember they all kind of giggled when I
said: "I am now going to do a monological interpretation of a Kate Bush
song."  But after delivering lines such as "but looking back over my
shoulder...at you happy without me" got to them, and there was a hush in
the room after I was done.  Thank you, Kate!  You did it again! [Sean Judge
5-18-91] 
...........................................................................
Lindsay Kemp (Kate's first dance and mime instructor) was interviewed on
BBC Radio 4 during the week of May 8th. In that interview he let slip that
he was helping Kate "with the tour". [Andy Marvick 5-22-91]
..........................................................................
In KITS (San Francisco)'s annual countdown of the "Top 300 Modern Rock
Songs of All Time", Running Up that Hill came up at No. 36, Wuthering
Heights came in at No. 20! [Ed Suranyi 5-27-91]
.........................................................................
 ...if Kate does indeed have 10 O levels that puts her in the top percent
or two based on exam performance. [Kevin House 6-16]
[I heard] it is fairly common knowledge in the UK that "Kate is rather
clever" and that she passed "four A-levels." [J. Fingerle 6-18]
.........................................................................
I saw in some magazine article... that Kyle McLachlan was a big Kate Bush
fan.  The guy who plays Sheriff Truman... says he was in a hotel room next
to Kyle's and would hear Kate Bush and Led Zeppelin through the walls.
[Steve VanDevender 6-22]
........................................................................
There's a commercial now airing on French TV for "o de Lancome" perfume,
and the soundtrack is Wuthering Heights, all of 15 seconds of it ! [Kimon
Berlin 6-23]  Moving is being used in Taiwan TV ads for the Nissan Sentra.
[Eugene Yang 7-1]
.........................................................................
What is Kate saying at the end of Hello Earth?  In German:"Tiefer, tiefer. 
Irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht."  In English: "Deeper, deeper.
Somewhere in the depths there is a light." [Richard Caldwell 5-20, and Jenn
Turney]
........................................................................
About halfway through Experiment IV, there's a choppy vocal line closely
following the line "It could sing you to sleep" in the standard version of
the song.  Guesses so far:
I think I must thank you for listening to my tune. [Ryan McGuire; Charles
Boyer concurs]
I bet my mum's gonna buy me a little toy instrument. [Andy Marvick]
I think the outline was they're making an [unphonetic] instrument. [John
Relph]
I've got my/mine muzzle(d) and they came in tune(d) to destruct/destroy.
[Steve Williams] 
Back- Back- Back- Back-slapping in between the instruments. [Dan Liddell]

Towards the end of Love and Anger, Kate says something that I can't make 
out.  It's about 7 or 8 seconds before she says "Yeah!" and it sounds like
"Only in Jest".  She says it in the video as well. [Bob Krovetz]  I thought
it might have been something along the lines of "pause for the jet" but it
looks like the "f" sound should come sooner in the phrase. [Neal R.
Caldwell 6-14]
.........................................................................
.the names for this season's hurricanes [include] Kate! [John Grigutis
6-2-91]
........................................................................
Here is a list of Kate songs covered by other artists:
Wuthering Heights---Pat Benatar; Jah Wobble (supposed to be crap!!).    The
Kick Inside---Julie Covington
Runnning Up That Hill---Blue Pearl (involving Youth (Big Sky) from Killing
Joke and Dave Gilmour on guitar)
Runnning Up That Hill--- Tilt ("Kate Bush, after going through an
industrial dance trance.")
Them Heavy People---Ray Shell (a dancer/singer from Starlight Express
musical, Kate on BVs)
The Man with the Child in His Eyes---Natalie Cole (live only , not
recorded); Hue &amp; Cry (studio version is on the b-side of 'Violently' and
live version is on the live album 'The Bitter Suite',these versions in my
opinion are the best covers around. Don't be upset by the gender change.)
Also at the Bill Duffield benefit in 1979,I think PG and Steve Harley did a
song 'The WOMAN with the child in her eyes', though I might be wrong on
this point. [Andy Semple 6-3-91, with additions from Ed and others]
