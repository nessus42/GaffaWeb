Hi Jorn, 

My first choice was (1) because the --- part of the fem symbol would 
serve as the dash in Love-Hounds.  My second choice was (3), but after
reading Greg's idea for (7), I could go for that, no problem.  And the
colour he suggested are fine with me, too.  As I noted, I would take 
two for myself.  I have a feeling we could sell some at my party, but 
I really couldn't guarantee it (and it would involve me fronting money 
as well, and I don't know too many other people who I could sell the 
extras to-most people I know think I'm Krazy anyway because I always 
talk about Kate).  So I'd have to say only that I'd take two for myself.
I wonder if you could really have them ready by, say, the 22nd or so in 
order to have them arrive perhaps around the world by the 27th?  It 
would be great to have them at the parties, but I for one would be just
as happy to get it later.  Good luck in whatever you decide to do, and 
I'd be happy to send my $12 (or whatever) in advance if it would help.
