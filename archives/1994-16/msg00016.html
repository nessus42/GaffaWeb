&gt;FROM:  Sound on Sound (Europe's No. 1 High-Tech Music Recording Magazine)
&gt;       Volume 9, Issue 2 (December 1993), pp. 52-57.
&gt;
&gt;Del Palmer
&gt;THE RED SHOES SESSIONS
&gt;
&gt;[Sidebar] There's been a lot of publicity about Kate Bush's new album, _The 
&gt;Red Shoes_; RICHARD BUSKIN goes behind the scenes with engineer/producer Del 
&gt;Palmer to discover exactly how the album was recorded, and how pop's most 
&gt;enigmatic lady really works.
&gt;
&gt;                              THAT VOCAL SOUND
&gt;
&gt;The trademark Kate Bush sound that has been developed over the course of the 
&gt;last four albums owes a lot not only to the pulsating, highly atmospheric, 
&gt;slightly discordant noises that seem to emanate from every direction, but 
&gt;also her own unique vocal style, with its breathy delivery and haunting 
&gt;presence.
&gt;
&gt;       "I can't take any credit for Kate's vocal sound," admits Palmer, 
&gt;"because it was originally shown to me by an engineer called Paul Arden who 
&gt;taught me so much.  He would explain anything that I asked him about.  One 
&gt;day he couldn't make a session, so he said, `Why don't you do it?'  So I did, 
&gt;and he showed me how to get the sound which they had started using on The 
&gt;Dreaming.  Kate loved it, and ever since then we've been using it.


   This indicates that this interview was taped and transcribed. As far
as I know, Kate has never worked with an engineer named Paul "Arden"
but *has* worked with an engineer named Paul Hardiman on _Hounds Of
Love_.

&gt;       One of the distinguishing aspects of tracks such as `Rubberband Girl' 
&gt;and `Big Stripey Lie' is the pumping five-string bass sound, courtesy of John 
&gt;Gidman playing in the recording area &lt;??Disparity Alert&gt;.  His G&amp;K amp was 
&gt;placed in the studio kitchen (for separation from the drums) and miked with 
&gt;an Electrovoice RE20. 

    Here is another one. Kate hasn't worked with a bass player named
John "Gidman" but *has* worked with John Giblin (on _Breathing_.)
These may be Peter's transcription errors, but as I didn't notice any
other spelling errors, I doubt it. The errors were probably introduced
by the original transcriber of the interview tape. So I wouldn't take
this as the most accurate of interviews.


                          Chris Williams of
                             Chris'n'Vickie of Chicago
                               chrisw@fciad2.bsd.uchicago.edu (his)
