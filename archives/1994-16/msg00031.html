Chris Williams (chrisw@fciad2.bsd.uchicago.edu) found two bogeys lurking in 
the SOS piece I transcribed last night:

&gt;&gt;       "I can't take any credit for Kate's vocal sound," admits Palmer,
&gt;&gt;"because it was originally shown to me by an engineer called Paul Arden 
&gt;&gt;who taught me so much.  
&gt; 
&gt;    This indicates that this interview was taped and transcribed. As far
&gt; as I know, Kate has never worked with an engineer named Paul "Arden"
&gt; but *has* worked with an engineer named Paul Hardiman on _Hounds Of
&gt; Love_.

&gt;&gt;       One of the distinguishing aspects of tracks such as `Rubberband 
&gt;&gt;Girl' and `Big Stripey Lie' is the pumping five-string bass sound, courtesy 
&gt;&gt;of John Gidman playing in the recording area &lt;??Disparity Alert&gt;.  
&gt; 
&gt;     Here is another one. Kate hasn't worked with a bass player named
&gt; John "Gidman" but *has* worked with John Giblin (on _Breathing_.)
&gt; These may be Peter's transcription errors, but as I didn't notice any
&gt; other spelling errors, I doubt it. The errors were probably introduced
&gt; by the original transcriber of the interview tape. So I wouldn't take
&gt; this as the most accurate of interviews.

       Well, there *are* typos, but these aren't among them (worst is 
`Nemann' for the Neumann U47 mike; the others are just the apparently 
inevitable dropped letters here and there that no amount of care seems to be 
able to forestall, or of proofreading to catch up with--but thanks to Chris 
for the vote of confidence; I did try especially hard to get names right).

       Chris's surmise seems dead on to me.  What (if anything) does that 
tell us about the ascription of the bass for BSL to John `Gidian' Giblin?  I 
am assuming the album credit to Kate, as confirmed by Del most colorfully in 
his track-by-track interview, is correct.
