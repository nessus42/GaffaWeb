Ola!

Lots o' topics have been flung around, so let's get right to it:

Wuthering Heights Classic vs. Wuthering Heights: The Next Generation

Actually, I MUCH prefer the new version.  Kate seems more "in control"
of her voice;  in the original, she seems (and has hinted at it in
interviews) to be singing real high just for the sake of singing real high.

I heard the original YEARS before I heard the new version, and I heard
the new version when I (*gasp*) was losing my faith in Katehood (I had just
suffered sitting through the 12" versions of Running Up That Hill &amp; Hounds
of Love - great songs on the album, boring and unneccissary as 12" remixes)
Then I saw "Wuthering Heights - New Vocal" coming up and I said "uh-oh" and
prepared myself for the worst.  Guess what - I fell in love with Kate all
over again.

As for The Dreaming and fave songs, it's my all-time favorite album, and
should be yours, too.  But, except for "Get Out of My House" and "Suspended
in Gaffa", no one of the songs I would consider my top top faves.  It's
more the mood of the album, the perfect blending that makes it the masterpiece
it is.

On a similar note, I would consider The Ninth Wave my fave Kate Album Side,
even above TD, but NONE of the individual songs there rank even in my top
20 fave Kate Songs.

As for The KonvenTion, IED sez that The Line, The Cross, &amp; The Curve
is a flawless, utterly perfect work of KateHood.  It's great to see the
IED we all know &amp; love is back!

Old Topic:  Kate's Popularity.  Some folks were grumbling what she should
if she wanted to be more popular (yeah, I realize they were playing a "what
if" scenario).  As far as I remember, no one pointed out that she's 
staggeringly popular in Britian - all her albums hit the top 10, most going
number one; they all go gold, which means that there are A LOT of fans
out there.  Most of the singles hit top 20 (although not for very long, I
admit).  OK, so she's no Madonna (thank "Bob"!), but if that's not popular,
I don't know what is.

She's only not popular in America, and the only way THAT'S gonna change
is if America gets a sudden, unexspected IQ boost.  And seeing as how we're
talking about a country where Dan Quayle is seriously thinking about running
for president, I don't see that happening in the near future.  The Powers
That Be said Kate would never be popular here, so they're not even going
to try.  Of course, they didn't think Monty Python or The Beatles would be
popular here, either, so there IS hope.

- Stev0 the hopeful

"How do you find America?"
"Go to Greenland and turn left."  - Beatles, "A Hard Day's Night"
