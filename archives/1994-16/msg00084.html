Last-modified: 1994/05/25
Version: 1.1.a minus 1.0.l

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action. The full version is posted to
rec.music.gaffa only. You can get a full copy of the FAQ by requesting it from
me (uli@zoodle.robin.de). If you subscribe to the list (done by sending
email to love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net) Bill Wisner will also provide you
with the full FAQ.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.

0.   The Convention

     It has really happened to us!

     May 8, 1994, London's Hippodrome. Short list of events:

     - lots of rare videos
     - lots of live music/dance from fans
     - three new Kate songs: The Man I Love, Sexual Healing, and a brand new
       US dance remix of Rubberband Girl
     - a raffle which got the lucky winner the Japanese gold record for
       Lionheart as well as a kiss from Kate
     - an auction hosted by Dave from Homeground and Del Palmer where
       super-rare ("one exists, two exists, ...") stuff went away for
       2230 pounds (all profits, including these, went to the Great Ormund
       Street Children's Hospital)
     - a quiz that was won by the Norfolk Alchemists the second time in a row
       (next time we will practise a bit!)
     - lots of merchandise, some for money, some for free
     - Paddy Bush and Colin Lloyd Tucker (Bushtucker) presenting their album
       Skyscraping
     - The biggest act of Happyvangelising to date
     - Kate herself appearing for a couple of minutes, presenting the main
       price of the raffle to the lucky winner and presenting her new film,
     - The Line, The Cross, And The Curve
     - Kate inspired disco
     - and, last but not least, lots of fun

     Thanks for everyone involved, and see you next time!

[replaced KBC letter by a mini report]


  

1.1. What is rec.music.gaffa?

     Gaffer's tape (similar to duct tape, but not as sticky) is used to
     stop people from stumbling over cabling.

[I've been informed that gaffer's tape and duct tape are not really the
same. No discussions please whether gaffa really comes from gaffer's tape or
not!]

4.1. Kate Bush - her carreer and Kate as a human being

     If you want to know how beautiful Kate looks, listen to her music ;-)

[no fox anymore...]
  

4.2. Basic Discography/Videography

     The latest set of singles is The Red Shoes in the UK (2 different CDs,
     a 7" single and a cassingle), while Europe and Australia got Eat The 

     Music (different contents than the US one). The formerly announced
     Canadian And So Is Love single only went to a couple of radio stations
     unfortunately.

[compressed KBC letter #3, reduced to facts]

     Soon to appear: The Glory of Gershwin, a tribute album to Gershwin where
     Kate features with the song The Man I Love. Also soon to appear: Sexual
     Healing, a song that will appear on a Davy Spillane album titled A Place
     Among the Stars. Also soon to appear: the US dance remix of Rubberband 

     Girl.

[included new stuff &amp; knowledge from the Kon]

4.4. Fanzines

     Kate Bush Club (KBC):

        Right now any SA[S]E should be marked "SAE 5",
        except if you already have sent an "SAE 5" to the KBC.

[SAE 4 arrived a while ago, announcing screenings of The Line, The Cross &amp; The
Curve. Not yet in the past are: May 27th (Tamworth, Warrington, Hull),
June 3rd (Portsmouth, High Wycombe, Dudley), June 10th (Derby, Preston,
Bracknell), June 17th (Milton Keynes, Poole, Swansea), June 24th (West
Thurrock, Sutton, Plaza, Piccadilly).]
  

4.7. Experiment IV, the World Wide Web (WWW) Kate Bush home page

     Another Kate Bush WWW node can be found at URL

        <A  HREF="http://actor.cs.vt.edu/~wentz/index.html">http://actor.cs.vt.edu/~wentz/index.html</A>

     which is done by Brian Wentz &lt;wentz@vt.edu&gt;

[www is quite en vogue, isn't it? ;-) ]
  

5.2. The Kick Inside

     First something about the album itself. There are six completely different
     album covers for this album:

        1. UK (big eyeball and Kate on a kite)
        2. US (Country &amp; Western, Kate in a wooden box wearing red socks)
        3. Canada (Vogue picture, Kate holding her head with her hands, was
           also used for 1st US pressing)
        4. Japan (pink leotard picture)
        5. Yugoslavia (white dress picture)
        6. Uruguay (Kate's head only, technically a very low-quality picture)

     The last two are quite difficult to find and everything but cheap, the
     others should be relatively easy to find and are also availlable as CDs.

[this really IS a FAQ]

5.4. Never for Ever

     Delius:
        Frederick Delius is a classical composer who lived and worked ca. 50
        years ago. There's also a film about him and Eric Fenby ("in B,
        Fenby!") who worked for Delius by writing down the compositions for him
        (Delius was paralysed and couldn't do that by himself anymore).
        Excerpts from that film are shown during an interview of Eric Fenby,
        Kate Bush and Julian Lloyd-Webber in the Russel Harty Show. During
        that show the video to the song Delius was shown for the second time
        (the Dr. Hook special being the first time).

[this is one too]

6.1. Previous messages from love-hounds

     All previous messages from love-hounds can be ftped from the archives,
     residing in yearly directories under .../archives. Often the archives
     are a bit behind reality, uunet often refuses uploads nowadays.

[recently the newest archive files showed up on ftp.uwp.edu, haven't checked
on ftp.uu.net yet, but usually Bill puts them there first.]
