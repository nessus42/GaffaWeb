<PRE>
 This is my first time posting on lovehounds after getting the mailing for a
few weeks and figured since I have some news of note I should jump in here
and say hello. I first started listening to Kate around the time of the
Lionheart album and was instantly hooked. I have followed her through the
years and along the way discovered Loreena McKennitt, Happy Rhodes, Sarah
McLachlin,Clannad, October Project, Tori Amos as well as many others. Living
in south New Jersey, I'm fortunate to be able to listen to WXPN88.5FM out of
University of Pennsylvania. They play all of the above artists and are a
real source for hearing music that no one else is playing on the radio.
Which brings me to the news..
 On July 16th &amp; 17th, WXPN will be having their FREE Singer/Songwriter
weekend at Penns Landing in Philadelphia. It showcases 10 or more artists in
an outdoor ampitheatre overlooking the river. Among the performers this year
are Sarah McLachlin, October Project, Shawn Colvin, Iris Dement, Sam
Phillips, Odetta(sp?) as well as a few others. The shows have been great in
years past. I can post at a later date exactly how to get there if anyone
wants me to. If you do go, word of advice, bring a cushion as the concrete
seats/steps of the ampitheatre get rather uncomfortable as the day goes on.
 Before I go, I'd like to ask a question that I've often wondered about. How
many of you who enjoy Kate and related artists were also fans of Early
Progressive Music of the 70's like Gentle Giant, Yes, early Genesis,
Renaissance, Triumvirat, etc? This may have been discussed long ago or to
off topic but I just had to ask.
                               Thanks,
                               Wayne A. Palmer
                               Ye Olde Florence Train Station
