Once again "Suspended In Duct Tape &lt;METH@delphi.com&gt;," Meredith writes:

&gt; I'm afraid I was of little to no help to the Love-Hounds B team, alas, just 
&gt; as I was of little help to the Love-Hounds team at the last Kon, but hey, 
&gt; it was fun. :)

No, no!  You were our Scribe, and the beating heart of our enthusiasm!  *I* 
am the one who poisoned the well by getting suckered by nearly everything-- 
hollering "Under the Ivy!" so fast and confidently for "You know that I'll be 
waiting" that no one else's better instincts had time to function.

&gt; Peter M., thanks much for your detailed report.  (In case anyone is 
&gt; wondering, Peter Manchester also makes a wonderful and fascinating travel 
&gt; companion!)

No good work should pass without its punishment; so thank YOU again Meredith 
for getting me onto the very best flight I have ever taken (via Kristie, yes, 
but for the rest of my life when I see the Flying Red Lady I will think of 
you).  Virgin Atlantic is, as Meredith reminded me, what Virgin Records 
became, and it is a fabulous way to fly to London and back.  Personal TV 
monitors in the seat back in front of you in economy; free *electronic* 
earphones for six channels there--two of them movies--and eight audio 
channels in the armrest.  Complimentary bar service from the beverage cart, 
*good* wine with *good* dinner.  Best of all was Meredith in the seat next to 
me, recommending "In the Name of the Father" (powerful film), calling my 
attention to channel 4 when Cindi Lauper performed live on the Jack Dee show 
--first a compelling "Product of Misery," later a stunning jazzy number-- 
encouraging me to check out the Cranberries (audio ch. 8, the full album, in 
constant rotation with R.E.M. "Automatic for the People; both had their 
moments), and at all times being knowledgeable, eager, and wise.

Tell Kristie when you see her that I was *so* pleased with all aspects of the 
travel arrangements, above all with Virgin Atlantic, that on the trip home I 
bought *two* teeshirts (the Flying Lady, on blue, and the logo, on black), 
the Parker pen (an inscrutible object that contains a Jotter refill, but has 
no hole at either end through which it can be made to write), the J&amp;B Scotch 
commemorative liter for VA's tenth anniversary, *and* the aviator teddy bear!
