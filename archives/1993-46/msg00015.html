&gt; They are angels.  And when the apocalypse comes, they are going
&gt; to bite your fuckin' head off for not liking "Lily" and "Big
&gt; Stripey Lie".

Thankyewverymuch. *But* first of all, my head is not 'fucking', and
secondly, I *do* like those 2 songs, but not as much as others - I
was merely expressing my surprise at the fact that so much people 
seem to be so in awe of BSL, which *I* think is not such a
milestone in Kate's career.
Hope you will watch your fucking language from now on, Doug.

As for the Intergalactic Garage ad on this list: I have to agree
with Chris Williams:

&gt; WHAT A SCAM! Go crawl in a hole and DIE!

Same here. I *hate* these people who rip us off, all those dealers
who make piles of money out of the fact that we want to have things
that were released of Kate (or any other artist, for that matter).

Which brings me to the Amsterdam record fair I visited today. The
first thing I saw when entering that fair was a red box, obviously
with a 'Red box' picture on it. This was the official EMI promo box
set, containing a video, the CD, a pen wrapped in a red ribbon and
a parchment [?] biography of Kate. The dealer asked no less than
500 guilders for it! (Which is probably about $250 / 166 UK
pounds.) A total disgrace, if you ask me.
The same dealer had a 'sell-through' sheet (as he called it) with
a promo video. That went for 40 UK pounds.
Quite some misery to go through, 'cos I wasn't prepared to pay that
much for things I partly have already (This being the actual
videorecordings, 'RBG' clip and the sacred "Moments of pleasure" as
performed on the UK show "Aspel", july this year, and the music on
the promo).
But I didn't leave the fair 'Kate-less': I managed to get my hands
on the *new* CD-single: Moments of pleasure! :)
It contains MOP (lp version), Experiment IV, December will be magic
again and 1 new track, Show a little devotion. Quite a crummy
collection, if you ask me - only 1 new track.
Also I bought the US 'Love and anger' promo for 10 UK pounds (is
that too much? It's the cheapest I've seen in 3 years...) and the
German 'Breathing' single, with a dominantly-white instead of 
-black sleeve.

That's it you all, I had to tell someone... :)

PS they're re-running Miami Vice right now in Holland. Does anyone
know in which episode 'Hello earth' was used? I've seen it once on
German tv, but haven't got a clue when it'll be coming up now...
Does anyone have a clue?
