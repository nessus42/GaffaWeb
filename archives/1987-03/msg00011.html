(from Hugh Maher)

I don't know what everyone's been talking about regarding the 
poor quality of The Whole Story CD. I got mine from Tower in San Francisco -
a domestic EMI-America pressing, and it sounds fine! In fact, many of the
songs sound great, and except for a bit of intial hissing on "Wuthering Heights,and "Wow," I can't see what the problem is. Does anyone want to give
specific sections of songs that sound especially bad?

Also, has anyone else out there seen the new Kate Bush interview picture disk?
The pictures are so crappy (circa 1978?) and the quality looks sorta shoddy,
which makes it seem like a bootleg. The pictures are somewhat original - oh yeahthey come from that Dutch "bondage" photo session that Kate was apparantly
"tricked" into posing for. (at least, it looks like the same time period).

Any signs of the domestic "Dreaming" yet? I saw a domestic "Lionheart" CD,
of all things - what a great way to introduce potential new fans to Kate...
(cough, cough)

Ok, so here's the big news: The latest copy of Billboard has a big story on
page 24 about a recent Capitol mixup between "A Hard Days Night" CD of the
Beatles, which they mistakenly packaged in cardboard boxes of "The Whole
Story". (I don't know if the CD label itself said "Beatles" or "KB").
Anyway, one of these mispackaged discs were returned to Tower records
in Berkeley (not by me, unfortunately) by a KB fan complaining that
"the wrong music was on the CD" - god, I thought Kate fans were supposed
to either like the Beatles or have an IQ over 5...

Capitol, of course, came and got the CD back from an equally thick store
employee who willingly gave it up. Still, there are apparantly many more
copies floating around, so keep your eyes out! 
Perhaps this will recuscitate the flagging chart life of "The Whole Story".

By the way, if anyone sees a copy of Gerry Rafferty's CD of "City to City"
(doug pukes), send it to me, and I'll send you a Kate Picture disc and
a poster of your choice!

Hugh
