<PRE>
The following is a news bulletin for
dediKated fans only, served the way you
like it: light on the IED bullshit,
heavy on the Kospel Truth.
 
Less than one week after a British-made
twelve-inch interview piKTure-disk
(described in detail by your news-Hound
at the time) hit L.A.-area record
stores, a SECOND one has turned up!
That's right, there are now TWO twelve-inch
piKTure-disks, each with a different interview
with Kate. The first, which can be quickly
identified as the one with a blue-ish photo on
one side, contained a legitimate interview
which was only subsequently used in the present
illegitimate way. That interview is remarkable for its
awkwardness and tense atmosphere, although
the questions are only par for stupidity
(i.e., almost everyone asks the same dumb questions).
By the way, for sticklers, IED would like to correct
his earlier dating of one of the photos on the first
picture-disk -- both photos date from 1978.
 
The newest one, on the other hand, has two reddish photos, the first
a shot taken during Kate's stay in New York in November 1985 (she is
wearing the veddy proper white blouse and floppy bow tie
in which she made most of her public appearances there), the other
a still from either German, French or Dutch lip-synch performances of
"Babooshka", from back in 1980 (this was the solo performance
in a red jumpsuit with a bass viol as the only prop). The same
group of bootleggers made both picture disks, and both have
prominent catalogue numbers and copyright signs all over,
to lend them a false air of authenticity (bloody cheek).
 
This latest record, however, contains the now infamous "fake"
interview so justly vilified in the 25th issue of Homeground.
The questions are asked by a guy with a South London accent
who begins by saying, "Welcome to the studio, Kate," as though
she is there with him. In fact, however, it becomes immediately
obvious that Kate is not there at all, but that the guy is
editing in Kate's pre-recorded answers with his questions, which
are read from a cue-sheet in a manner that
approximates (rather well) a real conversation.
Unfortunately, the answers are only barely intelligible, coming as
they appear to have done from a poor through-the-air
transfer of Kate's answers from the official Canadian
EMI interview disk for Hounds of Love. This "interview" was
originally released in the U.K., L-Hs will remember, as a
seven-inch record in four different colours of vinyl, and the product
was slanderously misattributed to poor Dave Cross at Homeground,
which is probably why they got so mad over there.
 
Altogether a shameful and sleazy undertaking, but unfortunately
that won't stop a lot of fans from buying the thing (IED shame-
facedly included).
 
More KT news for Americans: Kate won Best Female Singer at the
British Record Industry Awards AGAIN! And this time she won
without even having released a new studio album. Despite this,
she was very prominent in the British charts in 1986, first
at the beginning with the "Hounds of Love" and "The Big Sky"
singles, and then at the end with the Peter Gabriel duet
(a big hit in the U.K., in the singles charts for many weeks),
and the Whole Story LP with its accompanying single (which latter
record was the only commercial disappointment of the lot).
 
And for those who missed Kate on Entertainment Tonight last night
(February 10), you didn't miss much. In the forty-five second
story on the "BPI"'s, as they're called, Kate appeared for all
of .75 seconds. She looked smashing in a quasi-Cossak-collared
black suit, with her hair up. Not to worry if you didn't see her --
the entire Awards show is scheduled for syndication, airing later
on this month, so scour your TV Guides over the next couple of weeks!
