&gt; [Michael Knight:] I'm saying that ONE of Kates albums is not as
&gt; crafted as say, some of Eno's albums. 'Before and After Science',
&gt; 'Another Green World', and 'Taking Tiger Mountain' spring to mind.
&gt; Anyway, assuming that 'Lionheart' is Kates 'bad' album, that make
&gt; her score 1 of 5, or 20 percent. Now how many of Eno's albums and
&gt; collaborations can be 'uncrafted' and still have only 20 percent
&gt; 'bad'.  I admit I can't remember all the Eno and Eno
&gt; collaborations/productions there are.  I'd guess 15 or 20.  That
&gt; allows him to have quite a few 'misses' and still be in the 80
&gt; percent good category.

Hold on a second now...  First of all, I never equated "crafted" with
"good" or "uncrafted" with bad.  Secondly, *Lionheart* is a fine
album.  It's just not up to the quality of her others.  I also never
said that all of Kate's albums are consistently more crafted than
Eno's.  I do believe that statement for *The Dreaming* and *Hounds of
Love*, however.  Thirdly, I'm pretty sure that IED has only been
referring to *The Dreaming* and *Hounds of Love*, since it was with
*The Dreaming* that Kate crossed the boundary from flawed genius to
God.  Also Kate has disowned *The Kick Inside* and *Lionheart* as not
being really her albums, because she wasn't allowed to produce them.
She also says *Never for Ever* is not completely hers.  The first
album she says is really hers is *The Dreaming*.  I agree.  I mean
just listening to "The Kick Inside" you can tell that it is as much
The Alan Parson Project's as it is Kate's.
