&gt;Doug has informed me that Kate is not responsible for the Fairlight on Never
&gt;for Ever which sounds like a ripoff of Tomita's Snoflakes are dancing.  Sorry,
&gt;guess I should have figured that she couldn't master the technology to use
&gt;to ripoff sounds, herself, and needed someone else to do it.  My appologies
&gt;to Kate for giving her credit not due.
&gt;
&gt;-- John Rossi
 
Well aren't we special.
Kate first learned of the Fairlight
during her sessions on Peter Gabriel's third solo LP.
She hired Richard James Burgess, the leader and
synth wiz of a shortlived electro-pop group called
Landscape, to help her learn more about the technical
aspects of composing on the Fairlight.
Since Never For Ever Kate has done all of her own Fairlight
work. That means that for five years and two history-changing
LPs she has been in complete control of all aspects of the
Fairlight (and of everything else connected with her art).
Don't you think just once you could try catching up with the facts
before launching your inept slurs, Rossi?
 
&gt;May I add my thanks to IED for the excellent Swales interview postings
&gt;and could I ask that he repost or Email me Part II as it never reached
&gt;my site owing to the aforementioned machine problems.
 
As IED sits indoors (back inside The House), oblivious of the
L.A. sunshine and bombarded from all sides by his The Dreaming CD, he
happily comes across Neil's kind remarks, and a smile of reciprocal
appreciation crosses his lips. He is more than happy to send Neil
Part II of the Second True and Only Gospel, especially since he
actually still HAS it (he kind of lost Part I). If you don't get it
by tomorrow, Neil, let me know. IED is not good with addresses.
 
&gt;Re Doug's search for a video PAL - I would be glad to help. Hopefully,
&gt;you should receive some email from me; otherwise contact me through
&gt;whatever channels you can.
&gt;
&gt;-- Neil Calton
 
At least one other L-H now waits with bated breath for word from
Doug on this issue...
 
&gt;Well, not the *whole* story......
&gt;Many days after ranting and raving about the incredibly inflated price
&gt;of the CD The Whole Story, I went out to one of the larger local chain
&gt;record stores and found &lt;ta, ta!&gt; The Whole Story on CD at a lower
&gt;price, about $15.  I still don't consider such prices reasonable, but
&gt;they do seem to be the norm.  Anyway, not being able to resist Kate's
&gt;eyes on the cover of the CD, I bought it.
&gt;
&gt;Now I am quite sure why the other one was &gt;20 and this one was only 15.
&gt;The expensive one must have been an import.  The one I purchased is
&gt;made by EMI America and was undoubtedly made in the good ole' USofA.
&gt;And what does the recording quality sound like?  In a word, lousy.
 
Well, don't say you weren't warned, William. At least two separate
postings affirmed the inferiority of the U.S. CD. You get what you
pay for. IED thoroughly sympathizes with your remarks re the
Government's import policies.
 
&gt;Dear IED:
&gt;As an interested observer to the "four qualities" debate, allow me to express
&gt;my appreciation for the amusement provided by the increasingly vitriolic
&gt;charges and
&gt;counter charges that were prompted by your gauntlet of words.
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt;-- Clancy
 
Thanks, Clancy.
(The rest of Clancy's top-heavily ironic posting doesn't
merit re-printing. Or were you sincere, and is IED just getting
more paranoid?)
 
&gt;P.S.  Oh, yeah, also notice that the digeridoo, which connects "The
&gt;Dreaming" and "Night of the Swallow" sounds a lot like an airplane
&gt;engine (or something similar -- in fact, that's what I thought it
&gt;was for years, until someone told me it was a digerdoo), again showing
&gt;how FUCKING brilliant Kate is.
 
Damn right.
And anybody who can sit through The CD of "Get Out of My House" on a good
stereo at maximum volume and still have only lukewarm praise is either
stone deaf or a pathetic jerk. There are no other possible
explanations.
 
&gt;The man at the
&gt;store said that "the rest" of Kate's albums would be on CD shortly...
&gt;but at least in terms of EMI's import CDs, the only one that seems to
&gt;be missing is Never For Ever.  I've seen The Kick Inside, Lonheart,
&gt;The Dreaming, Hounds of Love and The Whole Story on EMI imports.
&gt;Perhaps he meant EMI America... but given the comments some Love-Hounds
&gt;have made regarding the comparative quality of EMI America's CD's, I
&gt;would be interested to hear whether the domestic CD of The Dreaming
&gt;is as good when it becomes available.
 
Absolutely right. The only one still unavailable is Never For Ever.
The U.S. CDs are apparently going to be terrible. And we should
all count our lucky stars and a few brave distributors and
independent retailers that some of those import CDs are still sneaking
through.
 
For trivia buffs and maniacal Beatles collectors, it may be of
some interest to learn that an unknown number of packages for the
EMI-America CDs of The Whole Story ACTUALLY contained the still
unreleased CD of A Hard Day's Night. Two people discovered what
they had after buying The Whole Story CD in the San Francisco
area. One store was playing the Beatles CD when EMI authorities
came in and made them give it back. And get this: one of the
people who inadvertantly obtained one of the Beatles CDs went back and
EXCHANGED it for another KT CD. Even IED isn't THAT loyal a fan!
(He'd have kept both.)
All of this was in the latest issue of Billboard under the
headline: "And now, for the Whole Story on the Beatles/Bush switch..."
And the article ended with speculation that sales of Kate's CD
might go up in the next two weeks...
 
Incidentally, The Whole Story, having peaked last week in the
Billboard LP charts at 76 (if IED remembers correctly), slipped
this week six places. Its time has come and gone, folks.
 
&gt;     While I'm writing to love-hounds again...  I thought I'd
&gt;mention a couple things about _HoL_ songs.
&gt;
&gt;     I'm beginning to like "Cloudbusting" more and more as a
&gt;poem.  Forgive the freshman English class analysis, but have you
&gt;noticed that in the first stanza, Daddy is "making rain" and the
&gt;narrator (his son, right?) "wakes up crying"?  Also, the phrases
&gt;"bury it" and "daddy" near the end of both stanzas are echoed by
&gt;the string section, in exactly the same cadence as KT sings them...
&gt;also the lines immediately after them are "and forget" and "I
&gt;won't forget", respectively...
&gt;
&gt;--Jamie
 
These may be freshman English class observations, but they're
not as obvious as you seem to think, and they're the kind of
thing about Kate's work that too often goes unnoticed. Very
interesting. Let's get more!
 
Douglas Trainor, who has been choking the wires with reams of
unwanted, utterly inane verbiage lately, has this to say of Kate:
&gt;_The Kick Inside_ still remains a better piece of work &lt;than _HoL-&gt;.
 
This is such a weird statement that IED can't help wondering
whether Douglas has any way at all of supporting it. Oh! You
wouldn't have to be OBJECTIVE. IED doesn't want to overtax
you, Douglas. Just any reasons at all would be of interest.
 
&gt;Sigh.  I guess that it was too much to hope for.  The Marvick fellow
&gt;was sort of interesting.
&gt;
&gt;-- Eric Cotton
 
IED would like to point out that HE MADE the Marvick fellow! Marvick
would be nowhere today if it weren't for IED!

This is getting very confusing.
