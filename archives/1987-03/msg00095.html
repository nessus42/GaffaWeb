Andrew,

Now, I might have written something here which mentioned Pia Zadora, however
I don't think I did (someone might comment on this), however I doubt that
I would write anything concerning Experiment-IV since, to the best of my
knowledge, Exp-IV is some sky watching thing that Doug Trainor had thought
up.  Finally concerning the proported misspellings (which I am well aware
I frequently make) I never used the word libretto (or, what I must have
assumed the plural you suggest I used librettos), also being a Wop all of
my life I know how how to use 'I' substitutions in masculine declension
plurals.  If you take the time to read the sentence in which I mention
the 'correct' spelling of 'Windham', you will probably notice it as a
meaningless jib at Doug, spawned by the previous Windpuke Hill stuff, re-
reflecting my personal opinion concerning the music of Klaus Schulze.  As
for infantile remarks, what can you expect from a drunk schizophrenic, who
takes little, including himself, seriously.  Having to deal in conventional
realities on a daily basis, are hard enough without also taking them
seriously                    ^ (before we start grammar correcting here\
the are should be an is, sorry).  You see, between the dosings of 
chlorpromazine (soon to become haloperidol, I hope), the borders which
separate 'realness' from 'unrealness' become somewhat unstable for me.  
This is what particularly bothers me about your assertions that asthetic
values can have 'reality-based' definitions.  Outside of a pragmatically
defined universe (a.k.a. Piercian) there IS little reality.  Head expansion.
But, anyway, I wish that some light would be shed on what I said in this
digest.  It just occurred to me that it is possible that I wrote some
fantasy involving Pia Zadora, Exp-IV and used the term librettos somewhere
in these postings, in an alcohol enhanced neuroleptic state.  If that is the
case (and I would like to review the context, for my psychiatrist's benefit),
please elaborate.

Say it ain't so, Joe.

John
