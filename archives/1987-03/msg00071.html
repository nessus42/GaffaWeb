In article &lt;8702142335.AA17850@EDDIE.MIT.EDU&gt; you write:
&gt;Really-From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu
&gt;
&gt;The Billboard Magazine story about a Berkeley
&gt;consumer who got hold of the A Hard Day's Night
&gt;CD inside his copy of The Whole Story  was
&gt;turned into a segment in "Nina Blackwood"'s
&gt;"Rock News Report" on "Entertainment Tonight" yesterday evening.

 [deleted report of how Nina Woodbrain altered the facts]

&gt;It was interesting to see how TV news alters the facts
&gt;to make for a "better story".

Although I'm certainly aware of how the mass media alters and/or
misinterprets facts to make a "great" story (An article I published
in Science magazine was described in the San Francisco Chronicle in
a way that made it sound like I'd soon be on my way to Stockholm to
get my prize...) you shouldn't be at all suprised at the quality
of a Nina Woodbrain report. Recall that Braindead was without question
the poorest of the original Empty-V VJ's. And that, I think, is a
meaningful distinction. Actually, however, it's pretty unlikely that
Blahwood wrote her own copy. I'm even suprised she was able to re...
say, did you notice if perhaps they had dubbed in someone else's voice
for Slackdud? Naw, couldn't be...But what if???

Her pictures in Playboy weren't anything to write home about, either...

I recently celebrated a paycheck by spending a chunk ofit on some new vinyl and ended up with a bunch of 12" singles (EPs?).Brief impressions of the lot are included; if you want more infodrop me E-mail.Stranger to Stranger/The Child in Me     1985 SMI Records  This song got a fair amount of airplay locally on WHFS so I guess  it fits into the "alternate mainstream pop" mindset.  The album  contains two versions of "The Child in Me", 3 other tracks and  a short instrumental not listed on the sleeve or the label.  The  title track is a slow paced/dreamy "angst pop" comment on life  with subdued percussion, pained vocals and warbley/twangy  guitar riffs.  If you like somber, and slightly depressing, ballads  you might want to check this one out.  Of the other songs, "One  World" and "Give it Everything You Can" are above average filler  material while "Courageous Cat" adds something new to the EP.  It's a jazz inspired pick-me-up effectively placed following the  extended version of the title song.Stranger to Stranger/Don't Stop     1986 SMI Records  Another EP from this group.  This time around there's a lyric sheet  and "direct metal mastering".  That guitar is still there, holding  everything together, and their message is more coherent.  The four  songs here fit together better than on the 1985 offering.  All are  moderately fast paced and have the same level of production trickery  (fairly minimal).  The percussion is more demanding and the vocals  work better than the faster songs on "The Child in Me"; it all makes  for fairly interesting EP with tasty guitars and a nice under-produced  feel.Colourbox/Baby I Love You So     1986 4AD Records (BAD604)  I'm quite a Colourbox fan but even non-fanatics will probably like  this 12" single.  This single follows nicely after the debut LP,  with Lorita Grahame providing sumptuous vocals over top of a slinky  reggae instrumental track.  As on the album, there is some interesting  editting work used to introduce strange sound effects (like Hollywood  spagetti Wetern style gun shots) and off the wall vocals.  For example,  a quote from an Ernest Borgnine(sp?) movie pops up from out of nowhere  offering "You can't meet the duke</A></STRONG>
