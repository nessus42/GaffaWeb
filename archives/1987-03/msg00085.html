C'mon guys, get real.  Sure Peter Gabriel is a brilliant artist, (and
I don't even like the guy's music, but I do recogniize him as a
talented musician) but he's in the music business (read 'BUSINESS!!')
for the same reason that virtually all musicians are :

                TO MAKE MONEY!!!  

Don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying that's bad. Money is a very
positive thing.  (or can be, depending on the person using it)

Some people seem to think that all these musicians are just in it for
an 'artistic outlet'.  What B.S!!  Most are in it for the money.

"Who is John Galt?" -A.R.

[Hey, dude, get real!  Many musicians are NOT in it for the money, but
because they love music and want to do something they can feel proud
of.  Peter Gabriel is one of these musicians.  Please recall that he
left Genesis because he felt that they were becoming too popular.  Is
this the action of someone who is a musician merely to make money?  No
doubt, Peter Gabriel wanted to raise some money recently, and this is
why his latest album is so commercial, but he probably wants the money
so that he can work on some expensive projects.  One of his projects
from several years back, the Womad festival, cost megbucks.  -- |&gt;oug]
