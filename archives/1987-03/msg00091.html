Say, is IED still petitioning requests for an album that competes
with anything that Kate Bush has done? I just started reading L-H
again since the net rearrangement. I must say that that's quite a
broad and sweeping statement to say that there is no album that can
stand up to the works of Kate on such merits as cohesiveness, quality,
concept, intelligence, etc.

	I will gladly take on IED in this, my first posting to L-H.
My choice for an album that can not only take on Kate, but can bury
her, is Quadrophenia by The Who. I'm serious. I wrote a ten page
paper about Quadrophenia while in high school. I have yet to find
an album to match it.

	Yes, I do own Kate albums (HoL, TD) and do like them, but do
not find them to be increadible acts of genius. I challenge IED, based
on HoL or TD, to show how they are superior to Quadrophenia on even
one of the aforementioned points.

	Just to show that I'm serious, I'll show off some of the 
artillery I'm armed with:
	Story line: About a guy who's not just schizophrenic, but
quadrophenic (having four personalities. ala sqrt(sybil)). Further,
each personality is radically different and based on each member of
The Who.
	Musical complexity: A double album which contains songs about
each of the four personalities, as well as songs about the whole. Further,
there are four distinct themes which weave their way through the story.
Once again, one for each personality.
	Technical quality: One of the first albums to extensively use
synthesizers. Quadrophonic recordings were cut.

	Up to a debate IED?
