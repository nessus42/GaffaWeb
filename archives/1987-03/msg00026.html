From: Jim Hofmann &lt;hofmann&gt;

I got some shit from cum-hounds via ftp but now that we are gone
there's nothing going on except arguments about "art"rock shit and IED
said, "I challenge anyone to name one record since the late seventies
that is better than kate"...

here's something i wrote to ied.

IED saith: 

&gt;For the sake of argument (and out of a profound sense
&gt;of desperation), IED challenges anyone reading this to name ONE record
&gt;made since the early Seventies that attains a level of thematic and
&gt;musical complexity, multi-level meaning and sophisticated cohesion of
&gt;music and production comparable to that achieved by Kate Bush since 1982.
&gt;IT CANNOT BE DONE! SUCH MUSIC DOES NOT EXIST!


Although the IED will probably not take me seriously because I think his "Art" 
sucks, I think anything put out by the Butthole Surfers would fit this category.
I challenge the IED to go out and buy every Butthole Surfer record and tell me
then that the level of thematic and musical complexity (listen to "Gary Floyd" 
or "To Parter"), multi-level meaning ("The Shah Sleeps in Lee Harvey's
Grave") and sophisticated cohesion of music and production (c.f. the entire
Rembrandt Pussyhorse LP) greatly eclipses anything Kate Bush could ever
imagine from meditating on the way the chipped ice forms a ring around
her Big Gulp cup.  "C'mon, baby, c'mon, c'mon darling"  will always fall short
of "Hey, hey, hey" as relevant lyrics.

So now, I've named MORE THAN ONE RECORD, MR IED.  I CHALLENGE THE IED TO ADDRESS
MY CLAIMS AND TRY AND DISSUADE ME FROM THEM.  HE WILL ALWAYS FALL SHORT!
THE IED WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO BUY ANOTHER KATE BUSH BOOTLEG AFTER LISTENING
TO THE ENTIRE BUTTHOLE SURFER DISCOGRAPHY!  NEVER!  EVER!  EVER!  EVER!
THERE IS NOTHING,NOTHING, NOTHING IN THIS UNIVERSE OR ANY UNIVERSE THAT WILL 
EVER TOUCH THE HEIGHTS OF DELIRIUM AND BEAUTY OF THE BUTTHOLE SURFERS.  SUCH 
MUSIC DOES NOT/WILL NOT EVER,EVER,EVER,EVER,EVER,EVER EXIST UNTIL THE RELEASE OF
THE HUMAN CANNONBALL 7" (coming soon to a record store near you).

The glove is down.  Can the IED back up his challenge?  WE DOUBT IT.
