Review on several records which came out last week:

1. Gut Bank "The Dark Ages" LP:

This and the next (#2) are so good that I've been reluctant to post a review,
knowing that my vocabulary just can't do them justice.  Buy and listen!!

Gut Bank's debute album is great, strong through.  I mentioned my good
impressions of several cuts I heard a couple weeks ago...the rest of the 
album proved equally satisfying.  Gut Bank is three girls one guy and proves
that, indeed, women can play lead guitar.  (Side topic: know of any other
good female lead guitarists?)  The guy does rythm guitar and backup vocals.
The lead vocals sound very Patty Smith influenced to me, with the upturn
on the end of notes and crazed delivery and all.  The music is intense,
hard edged "new wave", melodic, often but not exclusively 2-chord patterns.
And it's unique as far as I'm concerned, since I can't come up with bands
they sound like.  Vocals are strong, guitars are strong...get it.
  Twin/Tone Records, 2541 Nicollet Ave, South Minneapolis, Minn 55404 and
  Coyote Records, POBox 3112, Hoboken, NJ 07030

2. Thin White Rope "Moondance" LP:

Very good rock with strong male vocalist and backing guitar (somewhat similar
to the guitar backing on Cochteau Twins albums).  I don't like too many
vocalists, especially of the type on this LP, but this guy's style is
addictive.  His sound is gruff, vibrato, and it kind of reminds me of 
Anthony Newly or someone like that.  The music has several influences along
folk, blues, and a tad of psychedelic lines.  Generally soft, mellow, but
in no way lame.  If Gut Bank isn't unique, this album surely is.  Apparently
it's their second effort, stronger than their first.
Frontier, P.O.Box 22, Sun Valley, CA 91353

3. Scratch Acid "Berserker" EP:

Not as strong as their two previous releases (which are kick axe).  
Approximately two strong cuts, four lame/generic-Scratch-Acid cuts.

<STRONG><A HREF="msg00068.html">Various EP reviews (including XTC Home Demos)...I've been a read-only member of mod.music.gaffa for some time now.You may not recognize the name, but I hope the following info is ofinterest.  I recently celebrated a paycheck by spending a chunk ofit on some new vinyl and ended up with a bunch of 12" singles (EPs?).Brief impressions of the lot are included; if you want more infodrop me E-mail.Stranger to Stranger/The Child in Me     1985 SMI Records  This song got a fair amount of airplay locally on WHFS so I guess  it fits into the "alternate mainstream pop" mindset.  The album  contains two versions of "The Child in Me", 3 other tracks and  a short instrumental not listed on the sleeve or the label.  The  title track is a slow paced/dreamy "angst pop" comment on life  with subdued percussion, pained vocals and warbley/twangy  guitar riffs.  If you like somber, and slightly depressing, ballads  you might want to check this one out.  Of the other songs, "One  World" and "Give it Everything You Can" are above average filler  material while "Courageous Cat" adds something new to the EP.  It's a jazz inspired pick-me-up effectively placed following the  extended version of the title song.Stranger to Stranger/Don't Stop     1986 SMI Records  Another EP from this group.  This time around there's a lyric sheet  and "direct metal mastering".  That guitar is still there, holding  everything together, and their message is more coherent.  The four  songs here fit together better than on the 1985 offering.  All are  moderately fast paced and have the same level of production trickery  (fairly minimal).  The percussion is more demanding and the vocals  work better than the faster songs on "The Child in Me"; it all makes  for fairly interesting EP with tasty guitars and a nice under-produced  feel.Colourbox/Baby I Love You So     1986 4AD Records (BAD604)  I'm quite a Colourbox fan but even non-fanatics will probably like  this 12" single.  This single follows nicely after the debut LP,  with Lorita Grahame providing sumptuous vocals over top of a slinky  reggae instrumental track.  As on the album, there is some interesting  editting work used to introduce strange sound effects (like Hollywood  spagetti Wetern style gun shots) and off the wall vocals.  For example,  a quote from an Ernest Borgnine(sp?) movie pops up from out of nowhere  offering "You can't meet the duke</A></STRONG>
