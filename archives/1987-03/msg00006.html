&gt;
&gt;You see, IED has succeeded in pissing off two of the most calm, reasonable
&gt;and tolerant people on the net. I never thought anyone could incite
&gt;rossi or gtaylor to say anything that even approaches displeasure, but IED, 
&gt;in the space of a few months, has performed both impossible feats.

Perhaps we should displace "displeasure" with the kind of deep sadness
that I always feel when I'm in the presense of those poor souls who
simply cannot live in a world that does not worship their personal
deities (and keep the horrifying thought of *real* pluralism at length
by the occasional outburst that strips them of the dignity that they
cloak their pronouncements in). Still, we *all* have them, don't we?

I imagine that those of you who are still awake will now endure a
long posting or two from andrew that attempts to "clarify" his
position. You're all free to have at the boy-I suspect with little
success (if you define success as an ability to divert him from
the true way). Still, such exercises are occasionally a decent way
to approach thinking through one's own biases-if you don't find other
ways to do the same thing.

ON ANOTHER SUBJECT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
In the course of putting together a 2-hour program of new music for
acoustic pianos (Roger Miller, Conlon Nancarrow, Paul Marotta, Gavin
Bryars (his new tuned percussion/french horn stuff on ECM is beautiful,
by the way), Daniel Lentz, Cage et. al.) for a local station, I found
out that I have something pretty unusual in my old tape collection: a
live recording (no treatments, only the slightest bit of detuning via
a harmonizer) of Harold Budd performing at New Music America in Chicago
in '82. It's a 15-25 minute version of "Children on the Hill," and I
think that it's the closest you'll ever come to hearing how Budd thinks
about improvising (unsurprisingly, there's a lot of Terry Riley's style
to be heard). When I get some time, I could probably dub off a copy
(it's from the radio) for whomever might like one. Send mail and we'll
talk about it.
