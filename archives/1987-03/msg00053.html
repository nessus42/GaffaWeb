&gt;Really-From: nessus (Doug Alan)
&gt;I really don't see how anyone who has listened to *Running Up That
&gt;Hill*, can be surprised by the level of commerciality of "Experiment
&gt;IV".  "Experiment IV" sounds *much* less commercial and performed much
&gt;worse commercially in the singles market than "Running Up That Hill",
&gt;"Hounds of Love", "Cloudbusting", etc.  How often do you hear a long
&gt;violin solo in a top-40 song?

Don't like "Running up that Hill" either.  Sounds too much like
"Experiment IV."  And whether the rest of the world likes it doesn't
matter to me - I'm sure "Pia Zadora Sings the Great Librettos" would
be as much a commercial "flop" as "Experiment IV" was, but that 
doesn't make it better than "Cloudbusting."  Long violin solos - 
there was something that was popular last month that always started
with such a haunting instrumental that I was sure it had to be Kate,
but then the drums set in - BOOM boom Boom boom BOOM diddy Boom boom -
and the guitars and the (urp) singing, and I had to turn it off.
 
&gt;&gt;(me) The lyrics are stupid, the rhythm boring, the melody unoriginal.
&gt;
&gt;I think you forgot the mention the chilling story line, the subtle and
&gt;intricate texture, the hynotizing groove, and the haunting violin
&gt;combined with a suprizingly catchy melody.  As I've said before, this
&gt;song (at least the 12-inch) sounds as close to Klaus Schulze and
&gt;some Windom Hill as it does to a pop song.

I forgot to mention the cliched story line, the droning texture, the
sleep-inducing groove, and the - well, OK, the violin's not bad.  Oh
yeah.  I also forgot to mention the friggin' HELICOPTER.

"Windom" Hill?

NOW!  As promised!  This month's presentation of the Andrew Award
for Sophistication, Originality and Complexity in a Post-70's Album!
Established in honor of Andrew Marvick in 1987, the Andy can
be given ONLY to those albums which EQUAL or BETTER the work of
Kate Bush in ALL THREE of the above categories.  Here comes Spuds
McCollins with the envelope... the winner is...

	XTC, _SkyLarking_

Any argument and I'll lock you up with Spuds.
