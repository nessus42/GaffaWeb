&gt; You're sure that Skylarking is one of the two best,
&gt; yet you have no idea what the other one is.
&gt; Just the kind of sloppy thinking that makes your judgements so hard
&gt; to take seriously.
 
Oh give me a break please!  Obviously, you have little or no sens of
humour when it comes to complimenting any music other than Kate's.
 
&gt; ... the music is NOT
&gt; "weepy" at all.
 
WRONG!  To *YOU* it isn't "weepy" at all, but to *MY EARS* it IS.
OK?  Now if you feel like coming up with a concrete solid definition
of "weepy" that excludes the violin intro the 12" version of "Experiment
IV" then fine, it isn't "weepy" by THAT DEFINITION, but to me, by
my personal definition of "weepy" it MOST CERTAINLY IS.  Got it?
 
&gt; How many innovations are required before you deem something
&gt; "dynamic", anyway?
 
As many as it takes for me to sit up in my chair, put aside whatever
I was doing and say "Wow!"   "Experiment IV" totally failed to have
that effect on me.
 
&gt; The bias in favour of
&gt; "Jig Of Life" (one specific track from "The Ninth Wave" -- that's
&gt; just WEIRD, you guys)
 
What's so weird about it?  It was released as the B-Side to a 12"
wasn't it?  Obviously Kate thinks it can stand on its own, so perhaps
YOU are the one being weird, not us!
 
&gt; In IED's opinion, "Jig Of Life" is much less subtle work than
&gt; "X4"
 
Well, that's what you think.  I think "Jig Of Life" scores over "X4"
So what if most of the music is not an original idea?  Do I have to
bring up your own argument of whether or not art has to be Novel or
just Good?  Think before you fly off the handle, IED...
