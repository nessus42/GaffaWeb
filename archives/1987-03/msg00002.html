&gt;
&gt;&gt;Really-From: Dave "disK-adminisTration fascist" Hsu &lt;hsu@eneevax.umd.edu&gt;
&gt;&gt; Fortunately (for you D.C. KT CD people) The Wiz warehouse store in
&gt;&gt; Beltsville has the EMI/America CD of "The Whole Story" for $12.99,
&gt;&gt; $11.99 on sale weekends.
&gt;
&gt;I maintain that the EMI-America CD of "The Whole Story" isn't worth
&gt;$12.99 or $11.99 or even $9.99.  It might be worth as much as $4.99.

*gasp*, sacrilege...surely it's worth the cost of a lunch?

&gt;It's probably worth the cost of the materials.  My CD copy of Santana's
&gt;Abraxas (can you say "Hiss City, Arizona"?) is better than this disk,
&gt;qualitywize.  Oh well, I think I'll live with it.  I'm not about to
&gt;spend $20 on a "best of" collection, even if it is Kate Bush.  And now
&gt;that "The Dreaming" is out and rumor has "Never for Ever" practically
&gt;on the shelves, then the only unique things you get with "The Whole Story"
&gt;is "Experiment IV" and the alternative vocal to "Wuthering Heights".
&gt;So I'll probably live with this bad copy, at least for awhile.
&gt;
&gt;			William LeFebvre

Hmmm...I'm new at this, and working my way _backwards_ from the worst to
the best discs (as I find them), having spent the better part of last
spring cooped up in a small room covertly listening to a friend's copy of
HoL.  So I've gone the total immersion route: 14 hrs a day (thank God for
the Sony D5), which just leaves time to commute and eat.  These headphones
haven't left my head in a long time.  Sort of a trial by wire.  So here we
are, in the Betty Ford Clinic, if you will, of modern music.

And what is it about Doktor Bush that drives people to obsessively visit
local record shops in search of import editions before domestic pressings
displace them?  That wipes out the ability to follow a one-CD per week
rule?  That allows people to wade through a swamp of hissing noise to buy
a disc of minimal quality and still be _happy_?  Am I in need of
professional help?  And where can I find a copy of The Dreaming?

Grrrr.  You find one of those places where C.P. Snow's Two Cultures meet,
and her record company doesn't like North America.

p.s. |&gt;oug: you were right, Diamanda Galas IS the AntiChrist.  I apologize.
