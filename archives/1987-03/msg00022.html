I must indeed apologize for having better things to do with my time than
memorize all the musicians and their instruments on any given album I listen
to.  Now, I realize that there are those of us on this list that must include
Kate into every aspect of their lives.  I really don't care that it wasn't
Kate who played the Fairlight on Never for Ever, I guess that the old axiom
about assuming making an ass out of u and me holds here.  However, even though
Kate may not have been playing the Fairlight, and I will even go so far as to
say that the sounds which I consider Tomita-like might have even been made 
using a CS-80 (afterall Tomita didn't use sampling synths, either), I still 
maintain that many of the electronically produced paterns are dead ripoffs
from Snowflakes are Dancing.  This is in itself not bad, in that I consider
some of the sounds to be very intricate and subtle variations on standard
instrument sounds, however, what I was trying to say was that much of it, for
which Kate must surely be given credit (this isn't an Alan Parson's album we
are discussing here) has been done before, and furthermore, done better by
Tomita.  MYGOD!! I said better.  Did I mean better?  No, I guess I meant
more asthetically pleasing (a very strange description, indeed) to me as
a disembodied metaphor existing somewhere in ARPANET.

To Doug Trainor : Do you ever read your mail or answer it?  I have been trying
to send mail to an address which will work for you.  I am of the opinion that
IED should continue to receive the stuff that you've been sending out lately.
It should almost make up for the enormous time his almost meaningless fanatical
ramblings take up in Love-Hounds.  Please construct for me a mailing address
for you that I can access without the domain names.  Does LOCUS.ARPA work?

To Wicinski : Have you gotten my mail I sent to CSS yet, shoult I try CST or
can you be reached a la Hofpersonn at COM?

About Diamanda Galas : Will someone purchase The Divine Punishment for me?
I will gladly pre-pay by check if you can send me an address and reserve a
copy whever you can find it.

To Bill Hsu : Your Coitus tape will be on the way shortly, I hope you haven't
moved since you last sent your address.

Squids who spew on squids are the luckiest squids in the universe...
