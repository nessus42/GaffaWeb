In answer to Doug's request for top 40 songs with overbearing violin solos in
them, many come to mind.  The most obnoxious of the lot is just about anything
by Charlie Daniels Band (hey when the frontsman is a fiddle player you get a
lot of fiddle solos).  I can't remember if anybody in ELO actually played
violin (as opposed to viola or cellos only) but any of their stuff qualifies.
One, reasonably good song made the charts (at least FM) in the mid-70s by
String Driven Thing (Heartbleeder - The Machine that Cried).  There are a
couple Horselips singles from the same period which feature violin solos. 
There have been countless Jefferson (aircraft) top 40 songs with a lot of
violin solos.  To stretch the point, except that they use mostly cellos,
just about everything Kansas has had as a hit had string solos in them.
Also, It does me great disservice to hear Klaus Schulze and Windham (learn
to spell it) Hill mentioned in the same sentence.

Just trying to get into my head, a bit.  I keep hearing Red Lorry, Yellow Lorry
rhythm tracks everywhere I go.  Sometimes I wake at night, sometimes I don't.
However, many times when I wake I hear those rumblings of RL,YL comming
from deep within my waterbed.  Unable to shake these sounds, I reach for my
usually handy bottle of generic phenothiazines, and of course, the sounds
go away.  Someday, maybe the sounds will be replaced by a much more soothing
instrumentals, or the voices more commonly heard by people suffering from
this affliction.  On the other hand, maybe the sounds are REAL and the drugs
only cause me to enter a deep sleep or comatose condition in which I don't
hear them.  Do you think that Red Lorry, Yellow Lorry are doing nightly (well,
almodt nightly) performances in my waterbed?

Has anyone inquired about IED's sexual predisposition lately?

Note:  During the first 10 minutes permeability increased rapidly; then there
appeared to be a leveling off or an adjustment period, after which the uptake
by the amoebae reached its peak after 45 minutes.  Although a decrease in
permeability was noted after the peak was reached in 45 minutes, the uptake
did not drop as low as that observed for the untreated amoebae.  These 
results were further enhanced by the demonstration that uptake and overall
permeability were similarly effected in similarly treated squid.  As would
be anticipated, however, the squid exhibited a tendency for permeability
to level off after peak permeability (65 min) and did not exhibit as sharp
a decline as that observed in the amoebae.  These differences may be accounted
for by the ganglionic innervation present in the squid, but quite obviously
absent in the amoebae.

Back to a very old posting by Doug.  MDMA is generally known as Ecstasy on
the street and is now been deemed illegal by the FDA as a schedule-1 drug.
However, a similar acetylated version is legally available, but I can't 
remember that its street name is.  Ah, better living through designer
chemistry.

Note: The preceeding paragraph in no way promotes drug abuse of any kind, nor
does it suggest that condoms should be worn to decrease the chance of AIDS
infection.  All offened persons can send their responses to Dr. Thomas Hanna
(HANNA@NUSC), who neither uses illicit drugs nor has AIDS.

I think I an going to switch from phenothiazines to bytyrophenones, maybe then
the oatmeal will solidify.

Come to think if it I'll have a double Two Fingers white up, in a glass, 
please.

John
