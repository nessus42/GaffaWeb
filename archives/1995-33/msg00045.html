   Is anyone familiar with the band Sunday All Over the World?
   This band has been described as a cross between Kate Bush 
   and King Crimson.

Actually, it sounds much more like a cross between Toyah and King
Crimson.

Which in fact, it actually is.

&gt; I have the only CD I've ever found, and 
&gt; the description is correct.  The band included Robert Fripp and
&gt; his wife Toyah Wilcox.  Toyah does remind many people of Kate.

&gt; Has Toyah done any other music??

Oh, yes, I have a pile of her albums, but I can't really tolerate them
anymore.  Many years ago they were of some interest to Kate Bush fans,
because she was one of a very few female artists who sounded even
remotely like Kate.  These days there are much better choices to
pick from.

Toyah sounds a bit like Kate, if Kate had a lot less talent, wanted to
perfom pop metal songs, and did weird things with her voice just for
the sake of being weird, rather than doing weird things to increase
the overall artitistic quality of the work.

On the other hand, Sunday All Over the World is quite good.  Fripp
gives a much needed talent injection to Toyah, and also keeps her
histrionics in check.  Definitely worth checking out.

|&gt;oug

P.S. Danielle Dax was also sniffing around Fripp a number of years
ago, but nothing ever came of it.  I guess instead Toyah nabbed him
first, or vice versa.  It's kind of a shame since it would be really
interesting to see what Dax and Fripp would have done together.
