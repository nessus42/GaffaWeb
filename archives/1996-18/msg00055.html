Subject: Violet's gummed up headphone jack

Violet,

Try a Q-tip and some alchohol or lighter fluid to get the gummy glue out of your 
headphone jack.  Both of these fluids will evaporate without leaving a residue. 
Don't use nail polish remover! Make sure the electrical outlet is unplugged 
before you do this, just in case. (Oh yeah Karen, I took your advice and zapped 
myself four ways to Katemas.)

I have also used lighter fluid to remove sales tags from 12" sleeves without 
lifting off the varnish.  Unfortunately the glue from the sales tags sometimes 
stains the sleeve.  You can't win.  I complain regularly to stores that they 
shouldn't put price stickers directly on the sleeve and then expect to be able 
to charge $20.00 for the thing.

What does that have to do with anything? Nothing! Just a useless diatribe 
against ignerent retail practices.

...and then I told the story of finding new Kate Bush titles.

Well, as promised, here's the sequel....

As I already wrote, this visit to BUMA/STEMRA was paid to get things on the

easily done this through the phone, but....
What did I write? Early this week? Wait.... that wouldn't be.... that date?















THE FIRST OF APRIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Or, as they say on television:

GOTCHA!!!!!!!!

No, I didn't go to BUMA/STEMRA, I already fixed this thru the telephone, so
there was no need to go all the way to Almere.
Congratulation to Markku, who was the only one getting close to a

Subject: Wieland's Demo Dreams

Last episode, Wieland posed an interesting point:

Are these songs just foating around in the air?  Are there Kate songs 
even Kate doesn't know?

&lt;Meta-physical mode on&gt;
I think so.  I write myself, although not on Kate's level.  The best 
songs come to me fully completed as if on a recording.  All I do is 
reproduce the song I heard in my head.  My reproductions are not always 
true to my initial vision (which I would guess is a frustration all 
songwriters experience).  Sometimes I hear instruments that I don't know 
how to play, or sounds that I don't know how to make.  If I try to jump 
start the process by forcing myself to write, the results are always 
unsatisfying.  Anybody else have a similar experience?

I believe, personally, that music is all around us, and that some people can 
tap into it and reproduce it for those others who can't.  The visionary 
songwriters (like Kate) blaze the trails and open other people up to new 
possibilities.  Others just copy.  Where it comes from, I couldn't say, 
but it is a wonderful thing, is it not?

Eric Johnson, who is a guitarist of amazing ability and emotion, mentions 
a similar experience to Wieland's in May's Guitar Player magazine:

"I even hear songs in my sleep.  Like, in a dream somebody'll go, 'Have 
you heard this song?  It's a Beatles track that was never released.'  
I'll put it on, and it'll be great.  It's a real statement on how 
profound the 90% of our consiousness that we're not aware of is.  I'll 
wake up and go 'Wow!  What a song!  That's the best song I ever thought 
about,' but then I can't remember it."

So yes, there are Kate songs in the air waiting to be discovered.  Why,
Tori's probably out in the desert somewhere RIGHT NOW trying to tap into the
right channel..... ;-)

&lt;Meta-physical mode off&gt;

We now return you to your regularly scheduled Love Hounds mailing list.

Hi KateFans,

Something has been bugging me for a while...  does anyone else
hear the extreme similarity between parts of 'Scares Me Silly'
and 'Oh England My Leotard'.  It would make more sense to rip off
an unreleased song, but it would seem unlikely that they could have
gotten hold of it way back then.

Any thoughts?

I don't think there're any difference in any of the CDs with the
exception of the cover sleeve for "The Kick Inside".  The "Hounds of
Love" cassette is supposed to have the Extended Version of "Running Up
that Hill" on Side A, as did the UK cassette.

Of course, the Mini-LP (songs from Never for Ever and The Dreaming) in
Canada was released with 6 Tracks as opposed to the 5 on the US
version.

Subject: Re: Cookin' SPAM

&gt;A proposal for SPAMicide:
&gt;
&gt;A gatekeeper system, where the "post"-processor will kick-out a post from
&gt;anyone not on The Approved List.  These purgatorious posts would be Suspended
&gt;in Gaffa and sent to a select, annointed group of X (20?) people (any
&gt;volunteers?).  If at least Y (4?) of these "gatekeepers" sent it back to a
&gt;special address within Z (24?) hours, the post would be added to L-H and
&gt;r.m.g, and the post's author ID would be added to The Approved List for future
&gt;posts.  If said confirmation did NOT occur within Z hours, the post would be
&gt;sent on to hell (and, in a perfect world, the author would go with it).

   Sounds like a very good idea (except for the problem that the only person
who could do anything about this is the one person known to be too busy.)

   A suggestion for a modified version....

   A modified news server that only carries one group...the un-vetted feed
to love-hounds. 

   Anyone willing to be a part of the moderation group will have newsreading
rights on the group...as long as they have been a subscriber to love-hounds
for a reasonable period of time, to make sure spammers don't join just to
allow spam.

   Any article that is read and accepted is forwarded to the rest of the 
group. Any article that is killed is put into a holding queue.

   If 4 succesive readers kill it, it goes into the bit-bucket.

   This would make sure that good stuff goes out quickly, and bad stuff
is deleted. I'd hate to have a long delay on non-spam just to get rid of
spam.

&gt;The group-moderation handles problems with undue censorship and moderators
&gt;taking vacation.

   Remember, although Stev0 is being really pissy, we owe a *lot* to Bill
Wisner. The entire mailing list is passing through his personal machine,
and he is hosting the new GaffaWeb site and devoting considerable
resources to it.

&gt;Additionally, isn't there a way to determine whether an address is "real"
&gt;(finger?)?  That could be a first step.

   If the address is SMTP-spoofed (as most spam is) the spoofed address
will finger ok. I could send you e-mail from president@whitehouse.gov,
and the finger would work. Also, this would exclude many decent people
who post from behind company firewalls, and everyone unlucky enough
to be on AOL.

&gt;The above system may not be technically feasible, given the list-processor
&gt;software used by "our humble pseudo-moderator".  There are certainly details
&gt;that need to be addressed which are not mentioned above.  Any comments?

   Something is feasible, either through NNTP, mailing to the moderators,
a password protected approval web page or something else. Almost any
active moderation will destroy spammers. Remember, virtually no spammers
*target* love-hounds/rec.music.gaffa. It's just one more list. To date I 
haven't seen any of the spam use the one method that would get around
the current system (no, I won't tell anyone what the weakness is.)

&gt;with the tweezers for half an hour!  Then, I couldn't get what was left off
&gt;of my headphone plug.  It's STILL sticky.  So I hesitate to do it again.
&gt;Sad sad sad. :(   I'm wondering if I could use a little bit of paper
&gt;instead.  I'm afraid that may be too thick.  I really had to force just the
&gt;taped plug in, and I had even used Scotch tape because it's so thin.  Does
&gt;anyone have a suggestion for an even thinner tape?

   I've never thought that tape was a good way to go, and have never 
reccomended it. At some point I'm going to sit down with a bunch of
connectors and my tools and cobble up a bunch of "Dreaming Plugs"
in 1/4" and 1/8" sizes.

&gt;victim without their knowledge, and then the scroll would be carried off by
&gt;the wind at a certain time (midnight?) and the demon would come for them.
&gt;If whoever possessed the scroll were to discover it and have it in their
&gt;possession when the time came, the spell was cancelled.  In the end, the
&gt;bad fellow frantically tries to catch the scroll that Dana Andrews'
&gt;character secretly passed back to him and destroy it.  This is just the way
&gt;Miranda looks when chasing the symbols.

   Cool. This is on my list of films to see again, along with _The Red Shoes_.

&gt;This film REALLY scares me, by the way.  And I'm a horror fanatic.
&gt;Although the demon does look a little "rubbery" and silly at times.  But it
&gt;still scares me.

   I spent a long time editing "The Innocents" into "The Infant Kiss", 
watching the film back and forth...and it *still* disturbs me.

  A couple of Kate's other favorite frightening films:

   The Haunting (the door bulging in was a major image for _Get Out Of My 
       House_).

   Don't Look Now (more disturbing than frightening, but *quite* disturbing).

   Yeah, I realize that I'm not unbiased, but Vickie is truly
one of the most amazingly fast and accurate HTML writers
around. She's a one woman coding machine.
