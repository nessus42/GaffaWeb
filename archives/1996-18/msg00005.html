&gt;As noted above, the working title was "Casting The Runes".

That was the working title because that's the name of the original work by
James.

&gt;It's been years since I've seen this film, but I recall symbols on paper
&gt;having great power. This concept was incorporated into Kate's film
&gt;"The Line, The Cross &amp; The Curve" where Kate's character is tricked into
&gt;drawing the three symbols in the title on paper and giving them to Miranda
&gt;Richardson's character.

And also the way the papers escape from Miranda and she chases them.  This
was how the demon was summoned in the film:  A scroll (just a small slip of
paper, really) with the runic spell on it had to be secretly slipped to a
victim without their knowledge, and then the scroll would be carried off by
the wind at a certain time (midnight?) and the demon would come for them.
If whoever possessed the scroll were to discover it and have it in their
possession when the time came, the spell was cancelled.  In the end, the
bad fellow frantically tries to catch the scroll that Dana Andrews'
character secretly passed back to him and destroy it.  This is just the way
Miranda looks when chasing the symbols.

This film REALLY scares me, by the way.  And I'm a horror fanatic.
Although the demon does look a little "rubbery" and silly at times.  But it
still scares me.

       Gave him the runes,
       And passing them used lots of skill."
