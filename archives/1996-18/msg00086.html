<PRE>
Thanks to Chris and all the others who resuscitated
the subject of the dreaming plug.  IED has now spent 
some time listening to Kate Bush's music with it, and 
has been as amazed as the rest of you by its capacity to
reveal further secrets. 

Though this particular one may already be known to some
of you, it was news to IED.  At 3:34 and 1/2 seconds (UK 
CD, original pressing, in case there's any difference) into 
"Waking the Witch" we all have heard the "jury" (?) pronounce 
what sounds like the verdict: "Not guilty!"   But have a listen 
to that passage with the dreaming plug!  You'll discover that 
there are TWO lines uttered here: "Not guilty!" is heard in 
the "center" (i.e., left-and-right-in-equal-balance)
channel; but in the outer channels, now much more
clearly heard with the Dreaming Plug, are what sound
to IED's ears like the words "Careful, I'm bruising!"

At 3:37 of "Jig of Life", simultaneous with John Carder
Bush's words "curl of the wave", several male voices 
can be heard saying "Get out of the waves!" in unison.
This incidence of the phrase has not been logged before,
as far as IED is aware.

At 0:12 of "The Big Sky", IED wants to ask again if 
anyone can tell what Kate is singing in the background.
With the Dreaming Plug on it sounds something like 
"You should never be a- (unintelligible)".  This has always
been a problem line, clearly a full sentence but frustratingly
(and all too typically) omitted from the "official" lyric sheet.

Another question: Since we can more or less isolate parts of 
Kate's music that exist only on left or right channels, is it not 
now also possible for someone to write a program that 
would record the Dreaming-Plug signal, then search for 
itself within the recording as a whole and cancel itself out?  
This would be every bit as revealing of the inner workings 
of the music, since it would leave us with ONLY those parts 
of the recording which are perfectly centered between
left and right channels.  Does anyone know whether this 
is feasible?  If so, would someone please do it? 

Thanks.
