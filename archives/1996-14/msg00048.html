Hello friends,

Mandy "Pandy" Heath asked about the background voices of BSL:

&gt; Is it just me, or do I hear the background voices in Big Stripey Lie 
&gt; saying something like "No more funny cigarettes"? 

and Roy J. Smith added:
&gt;If you're talking about the voices at the 1:47 mark and again 
&gt;at the 2:39 mark, no, I don't hear "funny cigarettes" at all. 
&gt;Perhaps a Dreaming Plug(tm) would be of help here.  Anyone 
&gt;have one handy? 

Kerry White added:
&gt;I tried to make a Dreaming Plug, but once taped it won't fit. 

It's a bit tricky, yes. I think it only works with the big ones, not with
the small ones. 

&gt;However I 
&gt;have a surround-sound decoder, and OOP sounds are treated as back-channel.
&gt;I just turn the front-back knob to full back and crank up the volume. 
&gt;BSL at those times sounds to me like, "Big bad lie". There are a *lot*
&gt;of production levels going on, even 'back' there, and a solidly conclusive
&gt;determination can't be made,IMHO. "Don't smoke funny cigarettes" has too 
&gt;many syllables to be even close. 

You're right on everything.
I tried it with my Dreaming Plug(tm) and you can hear it much better than
the normal way. To me it sounds like "Beer that of" or so (Just what I
hear). What this could possibly mean? No idea. The first two I could hear
as "Big Bad" but "Lie"? It would fit perfect, but I just can't hear it good
enough. 

After many hard hours on lots of sites Mandy added:

&gt;Oops!!! When I said I heard funny background voices on Big Striey Lie, I 
&gt;actually meant to say Lily!! 

Hmmm, but I've already filed you under: "People who have absolutely not
the slightest idea what they are talking about."  :-) 
(But nevertheless a good opportunity to listen again carefully to "Big
Stripey Lie"!)

Okay, "Lily" then: I think you mean 2:59 and the following? Just after the
"Rrrrrh" sound? It's first: "This is my space!" What then follows: ????
It's either:
1. "Exactly. Exactly." or
2. "This is my place. This is my place." or
3. "This is left side. This is right side." or
4. "Whose at right?"(right speaker) "Whose at left?" (left speaker)
or something else... (even maybe "funny cigarettes").
I personally believe none of the above is correct. 
The other background vocal I can make out is at 3:25-3:27: some throttle
sounds then "...ex".

With the Dreaming Plug "Lily" is a trip! Really!!
  
E A T   T H E   M U S I C ! ! !

Best wishes
    Wieland
