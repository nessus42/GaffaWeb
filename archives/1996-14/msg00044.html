&gt; Was watching my Kate boot video recently (had not played it for years due to
&gt; the extreme poor quality). Well anyway there is one segment with Kate doing
&gt; Delius on stage in a kind of butterfly costume. I love this. The poor
&gt; quality gives it this dreamy/cloudy look which seems to fit the setting. The
&gt; mix also sounds different. There is a picture from this performance on Page
&gt; 11 in Kate Bush Complete.

A most excellent performance of this song.

&gt; Also on this video is Kate doing BABOOSHKA in split face make up playing
&gt; both characters of the song. Afterwards she sits down with a C&amp;W group of
&gt; guys who proceed to make complete asses of themselves. Kate looks very
&gt; uncomfortable and my skin crawls as I watch this. These guys are not
&gt; American and it seems to be their show on British tv. Who are these guys?

Sounds like the above two are from the "Dr Hook Special" aired BBC2 on
the 7th of April 1980. Well, Delius was also shown on the Russell Harty
show on the 25th of November too, as a tribute to the composer.
Sounds like you need to find someone who can copy you the LoveHounds
Collection video pair, it's on there (tape A 0:47:32-0:55:18).

&gt; I hope there are some musicians out there that can help me with this one.
&gt; When HOL first came out I was just learning to play the piano (still am, No
&gt; lessons). I love Under the Ivy and And Dream of Sheep so I wanted to figure
&gt; out how to play them,so I did. A couple of years later I found the Complete
&gt; Kate Bush. Well I had all the chords to Under the Ivy right, but one chord
&gt; on And Dream of Sheep is different than what I had been playing. "If they
&gt; find me racing white horses".
&gt; E bass with E,E6,F#m7,Bsus4. I have always played Bmaj over an E bass, not
&gt; Bsus4, and the Bmaj still sounds correct to me. Maybe my ear is not so good?

Well done for doing what you did, I'm not happy with the Complete Kate
music (which I've yet to find a real copy of), it leaves *much* to the
imagination, and not much in the way of actually dicating what to play.

On your chord issue, if other tunes are to go by, the pseudo dischord of
an Eb AND an E fits KaTes profile. Also a static bass non-progression
staying on E is far simpler than the steps going through E, F#, and a long
jump to a B, and since KaTe admits to taking the easy (so more pleasant
sounding and flowing) route in playing, I'd go for your suggestion of:
	E E6 F#m7/E B/E
instead.

Actually listening to my CD (as I *just* did after writing the previous
paragraph), you can clearly hear the static bass E all through that line.
You can also hear the high Eb going to E progressing to the next E chord
for the next line.

Trying it your (and I think KaTes) way, it fits the easier (nice flowing)
style, including the pre-emptive from E6 to F#7m, my guess is simply moving
the E to C# to go from E to E6, making the F#m7 a simpler change than I had
been trying before. Sounds "right" too!

Thank you VERY much,

PS I've never had a piano (or other instrument) lesson, but can play
most instruments I pick up within a short while (much to the instrument
owners dismay/embarrassment sometimes. There they are struggling for
weeks to produce a couple of notes, and within 10 minutes I'm playing
simple tunes). I don't intend to either! I guess I should do something
to improve my sheet music reading speed though. Anyway I understand
many artists have not had lessons either. I understand from a few
interviews that if they had, they would have followed the "rules", and
not produced excellent modern pieces which often break the rules, but
sound so right. Such as the above B/E which is technically dischordant,
and would not be "normally" allowed (if I understand some rules I
have read about writing music "properly" - stupid book).
