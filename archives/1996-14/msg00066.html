the Energy Centres existing in the human beings, Centres
producing among other functions, what we know as FEELINGS and

(planets, constellations, etc), receiving from them its energy,
as a radio [A day of coincidence with the radio] receives some
sound wavelenghts or a jewel [mani = jewel] receives some light
wavelenghts.

   -  Among the ckakras there are "passages" connecting them that
some times are more open and some times more closed. Most of
times the "passages" among the 2 most perfect chakras and the
rest of the chakras are closed to a great extent.   

   -  The moon, through certain chakra, exerts a powerfull,
punctual, cyclical influence upon the human moods [Every girl
knows about the punctual blues], that varies according its
phases. It is strongest at full moon, weakest at new moon. At new
moon there tends to increse the opening of the "passages" among
the aforementioned chakras and the remaining ones. That allows
for the manifestation of certain Universal Law that, in turn,
tends to get in tune people holding certain affinities [ ... the
phase of the moon when people tune in; soul birds of a feather
flocks together] or, in a more technical language, sharing the
same archetypes. All of this depending on the grade of
"sensitivity" (please, note the quotation marks) of such persons
and only into a limited space and for a limited time. Here,
"sensitivity" means the capacity to receive, or to be
"impressioned" by, such archetypes. That brings about strange
coincidences that can't be explained just resorting to chance.

   Confusing?. Well, don't worry. After all, this is just a
series of theories.

   ..... Or not?.

  Disclaimer:  There are those that would be disturbed by this(nudity) but
there are those that would want to know: A skin mag titled Celebrity
Sleuth has the names Kate Bush and Tori Amos on the cover this month. 
  KaTe is just a copy in B+W of the poster in the skin tight workout suit. 
  Tori is a photo from the Oz tour: seated on the piano bench w/out 
underwear.  Apparently mentioned in Aus. newsrags.  She *had* to know 
this would happen,IMHO.

This is all I could find, apart from the obvious reference Emmy
already pointed out. From Andrew Marvick's "The Garden":

     [The following is an interview with Kate Bush by Hot Press, one of
the few British music publications which seldom shows up in the States.
The interview was conducted by an anonymous male reporter for the
magazine in November of 1985. Edited and annotated by Andrew Marvick.]

[snip - TSB]
     "Right, well it always affects me. Every book I've read has really
affected me. It's that special, you do create a relationship, really.
And that was such a huge story...Oscar Wilde was one of my earliest
influences--his fairy stories. I could still read one of them--
definitely--and cry. Terribly tragic stuff."

 Sorry to be dreary re your theory series deary, *BUT*...

 Taken from Andrew Marvick's "The Garden":

     [Here are Kate's writings from the Kate Bush Club Newsletter,
issue Number 1 (January 1979). Following the article is a brief
"interview" with Kate, in which she responds to fans' written
questions.]

[snip to the interview - TSB]
    In Strange Phenomena, what do the words "om mani padme hum"
mean?
     "Club member Matthew Toreson has sent in an explanation, which he
found in an encyclopedia. It is a form of adoration of the Buddha, and
means, 'Oh, the jewel in the lotus.' Thanks, Matthew."

[back to TSB-land]

 She didn't even know what it meant when she recorded it.

A quest:  woman seeks other women to jam with

Joan Galt is looking for some other women to jam with, somewhere in the
greater Washington DC/Baltimore/Frederick MD area.  Joan, who is in her
30's, is mostly self-taught (and always learning), likes to sing and
play her electric guitar.  Women of all colors, ages and types are
welcome to respond (agnostic and cynical tendencies preferred).  Note:
this is STRICTLY a musical thang!

Co-jammer requirements:

* Whacked-out sense of humor

* Must play some instrument well enough to accomplish something--
strings preferred, but woodwinds, keyboards and percussion are fine too
(unusual ok: theremins and zoomoozophones no problem).  Good strong
vocals are a plus.

* Must be willing to be totally fragrance-free for sessions (due to
allergic asthma)

* Art or design background a big plus--no lawyers or engineers, please

* Environmentally-oriented people preferred--especially ticked-off
vegans &amp; vegetarians

* No commercial aspirations--it's just for fun (but who knows?)

* Must not be afraid of "strong" language.


Joan's musical likes:

B-52's 
Gang of Four * 
Jane Siberry * 
Kate Bush * 
Peter Gabriel 
Brian Eno 
Portishead 
Alanis Morissette 
Crash Test Dummies 
Ofra Haza 
Thomas Dolby before he cut his hair off * 
Erik Satie

* but Joan was disappointed by latest recording.


All interested parties are urged to respond (*** via e-mail ***) with
location, talents and outlook on music, culture, life and the state of
the world...

This offer good for a limited time only, so act now!

&gt; Subject: KT in SF, November 1994

&gt; As much as IED would love to share his most cherished
&gt; memories of the evening, he cannot, as he was kindly (but
&gt; firmly) asked by Del and Paddy not to describe the impromptu
&gt; post-screening party incident.  (Karen will remember, though, as 
&gt; it all happened at her place!)

&gt; John Light and Bill Wisner were there, though.  IED doesn't know
&gt; whether they were explicitly sworn to secrecy or not. . . 

You know, the whole evening I really wasn't convinced it was all
really happening to me - meeting Kate *twice* in one year just seemed
unbelievable.  We have Peter Gabriel to thank, of course; I don't know
how he managed to convince her to join that WOMAD festival but whatever
he did is enough to earn my eternal thanks.  Her set with the Trio
Bulgarka was easily the high point of a very hot, miserable day in
Golden Gate Park.  And then there was the concert Peter played at the
Oakland Coliseum a few days later.  It was a make-up show for one he
had been forced to cancel due to illness some months before.  I knew
in advance that Kate would be making a "surprise" appearance during
the show, of course; her people had contacted me beforehand to set me
up with passes.  But it was still terribly gratifying to hear the
awed cheer of the assembled crowd of 20,000 when Kate appeared on
stage for the duet in Come Talk To Me.

But getting back to the point: I also was "asked" to keep quiet.  The Bush
clan has always been very good at taking care of loose ends.  Really,
though, what happened there shouldn't have surprised any of us -- Karen
lives in a terribly small place.

disagree with the above!!

Jane Siberry's recent work, _Maria_, is her finest ever!!  It is the most

&gt;Further to Vickie's note on the dangers of telling fake Kate-affair stories 
:),
&gt;
&gt;I was struck by the part of this note that said Vickie once spent some time 
&gt;on a chat channel arguing with some guy who thought Kate had a relationship 
&gt;with some punk rocker. Could this by any chance be Hugh Cornwell of the 
&gt;Stranglers?

  Actually, this was "in real life". The guy was insisting that it was John
Lydon (*way* unlikely - Johnny smells *terrible*. Kate smells very nice.
I don't believe Kate could have an affair with a man famed for never washing
his hair.) I've heard the Hugh Cornwall rumor before. IMO, this guy confused
the Cornwall rumor with the Vernoral article contrasting the the Catholicism
of Kate and Lydon.

&gt;(this part is true, not made up) I recall some stories about the time of the
&gt;first album that said Kate was indeed going out with M. Cornwell, but the
&gt;relationship broke up about the time Hugh spent a few months as the guest of
&gt;Her Majesty (i.e. in prison) for possessing some naughty substances.

    As far as we know, Kate and Del have been an "item" since the days of
the KT Bush band. So, unless they have broken up several times or she
is non-monogamous (unlikely IMO) any rumors of Kate relationships with
other men are simply BS. 

   Kate has vigorously defended her privacy. For years she kept her 
relationship with Del a public secret. In one interview she wouldn't
answer a question about "...who's yer boyfriend, then?" except to
claim that "...he's not a musician" in an appempt to misdirect the
speculation.

&gt;Reference to this rumour is made in the "Great Pop Things" cartoon (series 
&gt;that runs in the New Musical Express) that satirizes Kate's career.

    Where do you thnk the cartoonist gets his/her information? From sources
far less reliable than Love-Hounds. I answered a question in the Todd Rundgren
newsgroup about Will Powers/Lynn Goldsmith. I just typed in some stuff off
the top of my head and posted it. The poster responded that the information 
was exactly what he was looking for, and thanks. I wrote back offering more
complete information when I got back home with my copy of the record and 
the videotapes. He replied that he had to go with what he had as this was
for a column in Record Mirror and the deadline was the imminent.

   So, what I typed in was considered correct and published in the Record
Mirror. I was correct, but what if I hadn't been? What if I had typed some 
complete nonsense in an confident manner? Would I have received the
same response? Would the nonsense have become more believable
from it's appearance in Record Mirror?

&gt;Can anyone confirm/deny?

   Denying a rumor gives it more substance than simply ignoring it. Most
of the rumors of Kate-affairs are simply DJs and music writers refusing
to believe that someone as beautiful as Kate could be involved in the pop 
music business and not be playing the usual games (Mariah Carry's
marrage to the president of her label is a good example or Madonna
early relationships with club DJ's who could get her play). Kate's mother
and father were married till death did they part. IMO that tends to make
one seek the same sort of long-time relationship.

   The idea that Kate could stay with the same guy for years instead of
moving from boyfriend to boyfriend in furtherance of her carreer is
rather depressing to the average music biz hack. If she wasn't with
the same guy, they'd at least have a shot, y'know?

&gt; Was watching my Kate boot video recently (had not played it for years due to
&gt; the extreme poor quality). Well anyway there is one segment with Kate doing
&gt; Delius on stage in a kind of butterfly costume. I love this. The poor
&gt; quality gives it this dreamy/cloudy look which seems to fit the setting. The
&gt; mix also sounds different. There is a picture from this performance on Page
&gt; 11 in Kate Bush Complete.

A most excellent performance of this song.

&gt; Also on this video is Kate doing BABOOSHKA in split face make up playing
&gt; both characters of the song. Afterwards she sits down with a C&amp;W group of
&gt; guys who proceed to make complete asses of themselves. Kate looks very
&gt; uncomfortable and my skin crawls as I watch this. These guys are not
&gt; American and it seems to be their show on British tv. Who are these guys?

Sounds like the above two are from the "Dr Hook Special" aired BBC2 on
the 7th of April 1980. Well, Delius was also shown on the Russell Harty
show on the 25th of November too, as a tribute to the composer.
Sounds like you need to find someone who can copy you the LoveHounds
Collection video pair, it's on there (tape A 0:47:32-0:55:18).

&gt; I hope there are some musicians out there that can help me with this one.
&gt; When HOL first came out I was just learning to play the piano (still am, No
&gt; lessons). I love Under the Ivy and And Dream of Sheep so I wanted to figure
&gt; out how to play them,so I did. A couple of years later I found the Complete
&gt; Kate Bush. Well I had all the chords to Under the Ivy right, but one chord
&gt; on And Dream of Sheep is different than what I had been playing. "If they
&gt; find me racing white horses".
&gt; E bass with E,E6,F#m7,Bsus4. I have always played Bmaj over an E bass, not
&gt; Bsus4, and the Bmaj still sounds correct to me. Maybe my ear is not so good?

Well done for doing what you did, I'm not happy with the Complete Kate
music (which I've yet to find a real copy of), it leaves *much* to the
imagination, and not much in the way of actually dicating what to play.

On your chord issue, if other tunes are to go by, the pseudo dischord of
an Eb AND an E fits KaTes profile. Also a static bass non-progression
staying on E is far simpler than the steps going through E, F#, and a long
jump to a B, and since KaTe admits to taking the easy (so more pleasant
sounding and flowing) route in playing, I'd go for your suggestion of:
	E E6 F#m7/E B/E
instead.

Actually listening to my CD (as I *just* did after writing the previous
paragraph), you can clearly hear the static bass E all through that line.
You can also hear the high Eb going to E progressing to the next E chord
for the next line.

Trying it your (and I think KaTes) way, it fits the easier (nice flowing)
style, including the pre-emptive from E6 to F#7m, my guess is simply moving
the E to C# to go from E to E6, making the F#m7 a simpler change than I had
been trying before. Sounds "right" too!

Thank you VERY much,

			Bryan Dongray

PS I've never had a piano (or other instrument) lesson, but can play
most instruments I pick up within a short while (much to the instrument
owners dismay/embarrassment sometimes. There they are struggling for
weeks to produce a couple of notes, and within 10 minutes I'm playing
simple tunes). I don't intend to either! I guess I should do something
to improve my sheet music reading speed though. Anyway I understand
many artists have not had lessons either. I understand from a few
interviews that if they had, they would have followed the "rules", and
not produced excellent modern pieces which often break the rules, but
sound so right. Such as the above B/E which is technically dischordant,
and would not be "normally" allowed (if I understand some rules I
have read about writing music "properly" - stupid book).

&gt;The interview was conducted by an anonymous male reporter for the

   She also took time in the unedited eMpTyVee interview to praise Wilde's
"fairy stories" and related the tale of "The Happy Prince". This was mentioned

by Peter Manchester (Peter? Come home!) several months
ago. 

   This interview is without a doubt one of the best Kate interviews
ever. She started out somewhat indifferent, but by the time Wilde was
mentioned she was leaning forward in her chair deeply interested in the
conversation. 

   Our copy is probably 8 to 10 generations from the original, and has
lost all color. If someone has a copy in color *please* write me. I'd
love to include this on the next "Love-Hounds Collection".

&gt;&gt;And Wieland agrees:

&gt;&gt; &gt; Al Murphy was known to her as Smurf.
&gt;&gt;IED doesn't know where these two usually authoritative 
&gt;&gt;Kate Bushologists got their information from, but, on 
&gt;&gt;the contrary, the lyric sheet clearly has " 'S Murph", the 
&gt;&gt;contraction almost certainly referring either to "It's" 
&gt;&gt;or to "There's".
&gt;
&gt;I think I was to fast with my statement. Thanks for paying attention!
&gt;The only evidence for "Smurf" I could find were two LH mails deducing this
&gt;from the song, and HG 48 p. 5 where PDFM writes "Smurf". I vaguely remember
&gt;reading it elsewhere too, but can't remember where. I'm not sure
&gt;anymore. Chris, do you have any evidence for "Smurf"? I'm sorry about this
&gt;possibly false information.

   I remember the same HG. It *sounds* like she's saying "Smurf". And the
nickname "smurf" is a far better nickname than the rather pedestrian "Murph".

   Personally, I believe that she said "smurf", but that "Smurf" is a 
copyrighted name for evil little blue bastards, and she would have had to
get permission from the creator of said evil little blue bastards. So she
came up with "S'murph" as a way of wiggling out of a nasty copyright
fight. I'd imagine that she was unlikey to wish to get into one of those
after the "Sensual World" James Joyce Estate debacle.

   This is one of those questions that she hasn't been asked, and if
asked, is unlikely to answer. Is there a Level 42 mailing list or
newsgroups where Alan Murphy fans can be asked this?

Subject: Background voices on -eh- Lily

Hello friends,

Mandy "Pandy" Heath asked about the background voices of BSL:

&gt; Is it just me, or do I hear the background voices in Big Stripey Lie 
&gt; saying something like "No more funny cigarettes"? 

and Roy J. Smith added:
&gt;If you're talking about the voices at the 1:47 mark and again 
&gt;at the 2:39 mark, no, I don't hear "funny cigarettes" at all. 
&gt;Perhaps a Dreaming Plug(tm) would be of help here.  Anyone 
&gt;have one handy? 

Kerry White added:
&gt;I tried to make a Dreaming Plug, but once taped it won't fit. 

It's a bit tricky, yes. I think it only works with the big ones, not with
the small ones. 

&gt;However I 
&gt;have a surround-sound decoder, and OOP sounds are treated as back-channel.
&gt;I just turn the front-back knob to full back and crank up the volume. 
&gt;BSL at those times sounds to me like, "Big bad lie". There are a *lot*
&gt;of production levels going on, even 'back' there, and a solidly conclusive
&gt;determination can't be made,IMHO. "Don't smoke funny cigarettes" has too 
&gt;many syllables to be even close. 

You're right on everything.
I tried it with my Dreaming Plug(tm) and you can hear it much better than
the normal way. To me it sounds like "Beer that of" or so (Just what I
hear). What this could possibly mean? No idea. The first two I could hear
as "Big Bad" but "Lie"? It would fit perfect, but I just can't hear it good
enough. 

After many hard hours on lots of sites Mandy added:

&gt;Oops!!! When I said I heard funny background voices on Big Striey Lie, I 
&gt;actually meant to say Lily!! 

Hmmm, but I've already filed you under: "People who have absolutely not
the slightest idea what they are talking about."  :-) 
(But nevertheless a good opportunity to listen again carefully to "Big
Stripey Lie"!)

Okay, "Lily" then: I think you mean 2:59 and the following? Just after the
"Rrrrrh" sound? It's first: "This is my space!" What then follows: ????
It's either:
1. "Exactly. Exactly." or
2. "This is my place. This is my place." or
3. "This is left side. This is right side." or
4. "Whose at right?"(right speaker) "Whose at left?" (left speaker)
or something else... (even maybe "funny cigarettes").
I personally believe none of the above is correct. 
The other background vocal I can make out is at 3:25-3:27: some throttle
sounds then "...ex".

With the Dreaming Plug "Lily" is a trip! Really!!

Subject: A warning

I just heard something from a friend... 
and I would like to recommend:
No more rude jokes about KaTe please!

Otherwise:
Your life's not worth a rush anymore.
The knights of KaTe are gathering in the forest at dusk...
Whispers ("The power of KaTe is with us always to the end of the age."),
torches, droning sounds, weapons of all kinds (one labeled ExpIV), you can
see IED in his 100 kW 18-wheeler and the half speed master of TNW, they
are also equipped with VaGFLO's (Variable Gravitational Fields of Local
Operation), known to the public as 'GAFFA' (GrAvitational Forces Field
Attenuator). Their newest weapon is a "Dimension-Folder" aka "George the
Wipe". (In case you're interested: It operates using isolated super-high
energy Superstrings of n+1 dimension. Coming in contact with the target
they collapse back into n dimensions and you're just - gone. Well not
completely gone, but turned into an elementary particle of less then 
1 E-39 m length, which is not very much.)

Once set out, even KaTe can't stop them anymore. 
And: They will win.

A messenger came:
"The Kateians are coming!
 I've seen their cross in the west!"
...
They started the battle at dawn, taking the city by storm,
With horsemen and bowman and engines of war,
They broke through the city walls,
The Heathens were flying and screaming and dying,
And the Kateian swords were strong,
...
and when they saw East Wickham Farm,
they fell to their knees 
and I heard their victory song:
W E   A R E   I N V I N C I B L E .   K A T E   I S   G O D !
W E   A R E   I N V I N C I B L E .   A N D   W E   W I L L   W I N !

(from 'Crusader', btw. produced by Andrew Powell, 1979!)

As I said, this is only a warning...

&gt;&gt;The second syllable would be the latter half of a poetic pronunciation of
the
&gt;&gt;word "marche" (as "marche-euh", so to speak) -- a stylistic nicety that Kate
&gt;&gt;Bush made sporadic use of in "Un Baiser d'enfant" and "Ne t'enfuis pas". 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It's been eight or nine years since my last class in French Literature,
&gt;but as I recall, the poetic pronunciation of 'marche' only applies when
&gt;the following word begins with a consonant or an aspirate h.  For example,
&gt;the phrase 'marche vite' (walks quickly) would be pronounced 'mar=che vite'.
&gt;However, 'marche avec' (walks with), ought to be pronounced 'marche a-vec',
&gt;since 'avec' begins with a vowel.
&gt; 
&gt;I hate to be nitpicky about this (as if no one were EVER nitpicky on
&gt;r.m.g.  ;) ;) ;), but surely Kate is more careful with her French 
&gt;pronunciation than this.  

   Ever since "Ne t'enfuis pas" and "Un Baiser d'enfant" first appeared
various French speaking Kate fans have been picking apart Kate's
pronunciation. As she's never lived in a French-speaking area (except
for the time at Superbear Studios recording Lionheart) we have no
idea how often she's able to use her French. I don't recall her ever
being interviewed in the language on any of the French TV shows.

   I don't know how much French she had in school. I'll have to assume
that it was no more than the average amount a typical English student
would get in a convent school.

   The only French-speaking Love-Hound who thinks differently is IED.
He is of the opinion that Kate's pronunciation is perfect and it's the
*French* who have it wrong, and need to change.
