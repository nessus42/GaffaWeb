 WHO'S TO KNOW THE POWER BEHIND OUR MOODS? (Sphinx questions)

   The followings is just a series of theories that may or not
have some relation with Kate song "Strange Phenomena". It is up
to you to decide if the coincidence among these theories and the
lyrics of such song is due only to chance or ther'is something
more.

                           THEORIES:

  -   The tibetan word PADME [Om mani PADME hum] is derived from
padma, meaning in a literal sense LOTUS. In a symbolical sense,
it has the same meaning of CHAKRA, a sanskrit word that describes
the Energy Centres existing in the human beings, Centres
producing among other functions, what we know as FEELINGS and
THOUGHTS. Each chakra is in tune whit certain stellar bodies
(planets, constellations, etc), receiving from them its energy,
as a radio [A day of coincidence with the radio] receives some
sound wavelenghts or a jewel [mani = jewel] receives some light
wavelenghts.

   -  Among the ckakras there are "passages" connecting them that
some times are more open and some times more closed. Most of
times the "passages" among the 2 most perfect chakras and the
rest of the chakras are closed to a great extent.   

   -  The moon, through certain chakra, exerts a powerfull,
punctual, cyclical influence upon the human moods [Every girl
knows about the punctual blues], that varies according its
phases. It is strongest at full moon, weakest at new moon. At new
moon there tends to increse the opening of the "passages" among
the aforementioned chakras and the remaining ones. That allows
for the manifestation of certain Universal Law that, in turn,
tends to get in tune people holding certain affinities [ ... the
phase of the moon when people tune in; soul birds of a feather
flocks together] or, in a more technical language, sharing the
same archetypes. All of this depending on the grade of
"sensitivity" (please, note the quotation marks) of such persons
and only into a limited space and for a limited time. Here,
"sensitivity" means the capacity to receive, or to be
"impressioned" by, such archetypes. That brings about strange
coincidences that can't be explained just resorting to chance.

   Confusing?. Well, don't worry. After all, this is just a
series of theories.

   ..... Or not?.
