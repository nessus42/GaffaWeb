&gt;Further to Vickie's note on the dangers of telling fake Kate-affair stories 
:),
&gt;
&gt;I was struck by the part of this note that said Vickie once spent some time 
&gt;on a chat channel arguing with some guy who thought Kate had a relationship 
&gt;with some punk rocker. Could this by any chance be Hugh Cornwell of the 
&gt;Stranglers?

  Actually, this was "in real life". The guy was insisting that it was John
Lydon (*way* unlikely - Johnny smells *terrible*. Kate smells very nice.
I don't believe Kate could have an affair with a man famed for never washing
his hair.) I've heard the Hugh Cornwall rumor before. IMO, this guy confused
the Cornwall rumor with the Vernoral article contrasting the the Catholicism
of Kate and Lydon.

&gt;(this part is true, not made up) I recall some stories about the time of the
&gt;first album that said Kate was indeed going out with M. Cornwell, but the
&gt;relationship broke up about the time Hugh spent a few months as the guest of
&gt;Her Majesty (i.e. in prison) for possessing some naughty substances.

    As far as we know, Kate and Del have been an "item" since the days of
the KT Bush band. So, unless they have broken up several times or she
is non-monogamous (unlikely IMO) any rumors of Kate relationships with
other men are simply BS. 

   Kate has vigorously defended her privacy. For years she kept her 
relationship with Del a public secret. In one interview she wouldn't
answer a question about "...who's yer boyfriend, then?" except to
claim that "...he's not a musician" in an appempt to misdirect the
speculation.

&gt;Reference to this rumour is made in the "Great Pop Things" cartoon (series 
&gt;that runs in the New Musical Express) that satirizes Kate's career.

    Where do you thnk the cartoonist gets his/her information? From sources
far less reliable than Love-Hounds. I answered a question in the Todd Rundgren
newsgroup about Will Powers/Lynn Goldsmith. I just typed in some stuff off
the top of my head and posted it. The poster responded that the information 
was exactly what he was looking for, and thanks. I wrote back offering more
complete information when I got back home with my copy of the record and 
the videotapes. He replied that he had to go with what he had as this was
for a column in Record Mirror and the deadline was the imminent.

   So, what I typed in was considered correct and published in the Record
Mirror. I was correct, but what if I hadn't been? What if I had typed some 
complete nonsense in an confident manner? Would I have received the
same response? Would the nonsense have become more believable
from it's appearance in Record Mirror?

&gt;Can anyone confirm/deny?

   Denying a rumor gives it more substance than simply ignoring it. Most
of the rumors of Kate-affairs are simply DJs and music writers refusing
to believe that someone as beautiful as Kate could be involved in the pop 
music business and not be playing the usual games (Mariah Carry's
marrage to the president of her label is a good example or Madonna
early relationships with club DJ's who could get her play). Kate's mother
and father were married till death did they part. IMO that tends to make
one seek the same sort of long-time relationship.

   The idea that Kate could stay with the same guy for years instead of
moving from boyfriend to boyfriend in furtherance of her carreer is
rather depressing to the average music biz hack. If she wasn't with
the same guy, they'd at least have a shot, y'know?
