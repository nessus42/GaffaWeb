Bryan, I think, we have reached a deadlock now. Unfortunately no one else
is able or willing to help us out here. 
I believe, this is because most love-hounds are not able to stand the
true, unveiled word of God. It IS a hot flame and it will make everyone
burn with shame, who is not coming with a clean, pure and humble heart. I
hope, I did everything possible on my part. 

Okay, now: 

1. I was also very happy to find the 'piece of past'!

2. 
With a menacing whisper of 
Magic offer a-charming me 
Good, yes, but as I said: deadlock. 

3. weirdo &lt;-&gt; weird little
what can I say against a Northern-Kent accent specialist!  :-) 

4. 
I close my eyes to the cello solo and ache, 
The music will never let me blow away you-oo. 

This is VERY good, because it resembles/fits to the line: 
Don't even know you, but I need you to love me, too. 
Both times 'you' (that is me, the listener, I presume). 

5.
The Craft of Life: Sobers/Silvers, who knows, again deadlock. (With "it
sobers" I  didn't mean that I hear "it", but I was thinking about who
"sobers": He/She/It  sobers.. this fits not good to "our dark hair", so I
think "Silvers" makes more sense. )

6.
The walls too steep...??
deadlock

So, I think we should come to an end for the present. I will prepare a 
** "Preliminary, Final" Anotated LH-Demo-Lyrics File ** over the weekend.
Then I will send this to you Bryan and you can make corrections. After
that I will annoy you all by sending it in small portions to the list. 

Hopefully we then have a generally accepted basis for further discussion. 
Everybody should save these files! All old files should be deleted! 
I will place it with severalother things in the archive in the near future. 
Maybe "Love-Hounds - The Next Generation" will be able to figure out the 
backing vocals on "Scares Me Silly"?

Let me close with a word from our all master (who has 0DXM status):

***********************************************
6th June 1989:
IED would like only one favor in return for his services, and that is that
all Love-Hounds please take a moment to sit down in a quiet corner of a
room at some point and contemplate the privilege that we have all been
given to hear these recordings. Try to make an image in your minds of
little Cathy Bush sitting alone--perhaps in the old barn out back with a
few lazy rats milling around nearby--and writing the lines: 

"Somebody I couldn't see 
Tied me up and put me away 
Here on the rocks..." 

Then preserve that image deep in your souls for all eternity. 

***********************************************

Amen.

S R I
