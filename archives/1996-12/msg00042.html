Hi Wieland and everyone else who obviously don't want to tell
everyone else what their idea of what they hear, just as Violet did
and solved many problems we'd all had, a case of not seeing the
wood for the trees I think. Really we don't bite! I'd like some
fresh thoughts, even if they are just what you thought you'd heard.
Like my "piece of mars" - very funny, but how close, if only my
brain had been a little more in gear.

&gt; 2. 
&gt; With a menacing whisper of 
&gt; Magic offer a-charming me 
&gt; Good, yes, but as I said: deadlock. 

I just scanned all the lyrics and Kate had not used the word "enchant"
anywhere else, but has used the word "charm" in a few places. Not any
form of proof, I know, doesn't sound like enchant either.
Is "encharming" a word?

Currently in my online lyrics I have:
	It's calling me.
	With a menacing whisper of,
	Magic offer a-charming me./Magical world enchanting me.
Let the listener choose.

&gt; 3. weirdo &lt;-&gt; weird little
&gt; what can I say against a Northern-Kent accent specialist!  :-) 

I could be either, I just hear "little", but as I've said my PIG
CD of this is NOT the best quality, I'm sure you have better.

&gt; 4. 
&gt; I close my eyes to the cello solo and ache, 
&gt; The music will never let me blow away you-oo. 
&gt; 
&gt; This is VERY good, because it resembles/fits to the line: 
&gt; Don't even know you, but I need you to love me, too. 
&gt; Both times 'you' (that is me, the listener, I presume). 

Again of case of looking too hard, and fresh eyes (my colleague)
gave what appears to be a proper viewpoint (thanks Bob - who does
not read this - oh well).

&gt; 6.
&gt; The walls too steep...??
&gt; deadlock

More of a case of not being able to hear past all that echoic sound.
I have:
	Your face seemed radiant,
	The walls to steam/The wall too steep
	With the crack in a moment
	As I held you.
again let the listener choose, as neither makes much sense to me!

&gt; So, I think we should come to an end for the present. I will prepare a 
&gt; ** "Preliminary, Final" Anotated LH-Demo-Lyrics File ** over the weekend.
&gt; Then I will send this to you Bryan and you can make corrections. After
&gt; that I will annoy you all by sending it in small portions to the list. 

I've been doing this already (as the messages comes through), expect
in your mailbox what I have got for lyrics. If you've seen something I've
missed or been silly about, please mail me back. I can also process the
full listing to give me whatever tracks I chose in what order I want,
I'll admit to being a little adept with UNIX scripting.

&gt; Hopefully we then have a generally accepted basis for further discussion. 
&gt; Everybody should save these files! All old files should be deleted! 

Correct. Actually, I understand Emmy is working hard on her web page
to have such a good reference point. Perhaps she has been updating what
she has based on the discussions going on (Emmy, have you?).

&gt; I will place it with severalother things in the archive in the near future. 
&gt; Maybe "Love-Hounds - The Next Generation" will be able to figure out the 
&gt; backing vocals on "Scares Me Silly"?

Ouch!

			Bryan Dongray
