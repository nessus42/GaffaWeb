Hi,

     (interesting node btw...)
 
&gt; While reading through today's (7/27) digest, I was thinking about
&gt; something that had been posted a couple of days ago to the
&gt; Love-Hounds list which sort of ties in with something going on on
&gt; the RDT (Tori Amos) list. Someone had asked about Kate covers by
&gt; other bands--it interested me because I regularly perform
&gt; "Running Up That Hill" (a popular choice, apparently!) during my
&gt; sets. The reason RDT came to mind was because an enterprising
&gt; subscriber (my apologies, I can't remember his name although I'm
&gt; very sure he subscribes to this list as well) is putting together
&gt; a compilation of Tori covers performed by members of RDT.
 
Hi ! Well, obviously, that was me. I am setting up the "Tori Covers
Tape project" on rdt. If there's anyone wanting to record a
ToriCover here, (s)he's welcome! Just e-mail me...
 
&gt; I would imagine there must be more than a fair number of
&gt; musicians out there in Love-Hounds land: has anyone thought about
&gt; putting together a "homemade" tape of Kate covers as performed by
&gt; various Love-Hounds? Just curious...I thought it was a great way
&gt; to fuel the devotional fires as well as spark some creativity.
 
It is and I can truly recommend this. Obviously, I am too busy
handling the ToriCovers business right now, but I _do_ hope someone
will be able to set something similar up for lovehounds/gaffa.
 
As for the legal side of things, I believe Drewcifer brought that
one up, I think those problems only come up when one is trying to
profit from someone else's work. This project is not profitable. I
have set things up so clumsily :-} that I even lose money in the
process... But then again, I think it's worth it.
 
If someone has more information about this legal side of things,
please contact _me_, as I am planning on sending a copy to Tori by
Xmas. I wouldn't want the following reaction:
 
"Hi, I'm Tori's manager/record company/music publisher/whatever,
and I want $_______ because you lot stole Tori's work"....
 
I'd rather get the following:
 
"Hi, I'm Tori and you did fine work... &lt;kisskiss&gt;." Oh well... A
man is entitled to his dreams ain't he?
 
Please please please, some KaTeFan, come forward and lead us into
temptation!
