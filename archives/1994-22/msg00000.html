I don't think so...anybody can say what they want...as long as it doesn't
bring someone else down...Some may view the 'crap' crack as putting Kate
down...I'm sure that wasn't Drewcifer's intent...I also think that Drewcifer
must like ALOT more songs than he hates...

It seems that people are not allowed to dislike or even hate a Kate tune
without being carved to pieces in this newsgroup...

There are many Kates song that I either dislike or downright hate too...
YWA would fall into this category, so would Violin, Eat The Music,
Wuthering Heights, Fullhouse, Sat In Your Lap, Mother (stands For comfort)
and Rocket's Tail (notice how there one from each album).
But that's just me...everybody is allowed to his or her opinion and Drewcifer
expressed his...and now I've expressed mine...so you may carve away now...

Drewcifer was quite brave in stating his opinion...at least he admitted that
he didn't like a Kate song...so have I...how about you?....Are all of Kate's
songs perfect? (in your opinion, of course)....one thing's for sure, I will
NOT flame someone just because he or she might not like a song...everyone's
entitled to an opinion...there's no reason to bring someone down because
his or her views differs from your own...so...grow up and lighten up people!
...I think it's called free speech...

Way to go Drewcifer!!!!!  :-)

Peace

Ronald
