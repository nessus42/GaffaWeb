<PRE>
       Katemas 1994 has already begun, and best wishes for a wonderful day to 
everyone!  I'd especially like to thank the participants in the tapetree this 
year--not just Chris and Uli, Tom and Cindy, David and Tippi, Adrian, Graham, 
and all the subdubs in the USA, but most especially you couple of hundred 
leaves in whom the concept flowered, and who have been so gracious in posts 
and in email in expressing your pleasure with "The Lovehounds Collection."

       As your Loyal Announcer, fronting for the joys and sorrows of the 
operation at every stage, I am particularly grateful to Fiona McQuarrie 
&lt;fmcquarr@upei.ca&gt; for her generous comments today,

&gt; Although I am one of the sad souls affected by the Canadian slowdown :( I 
&gt; want to say THANKS to Peter, Chris, Tippi, David et al for their very 
&gt; professional handling of the situation.

especially this part:

&gt; I'm still waiting (but I'm in no hurry)

I appreciate that, and all of you who were willing to be patient despite our 
willingness to salvage our promises if you needed.

       Perhaps there is some use in noting that Katemas Observed, as distinct 
from Katemas proper, runs from today all the way through Saturday Within The 
Octave of Katemas, August 6, when Karen Newcombe's Katemas party in San 
Francisco convenes.  If the SVHS dubmasters on their way to David Zimmerly 
(by FedEx from Tom Estes Thursday afternoon) arrive Monday, we can get the 
delay in Canada down under one week.

       In all fairness I should underline again that at this point, all we 
know about the BetaCAM submasters is that they are lost in the mail.  Even if 
they are stuck in Customs, it could as easily be for suspicion of violation 
of copyright--bootlegging--as for being porn.  The tapes are clearly pro 
studio tapes.  &lt;NB Chris took particular pains in mastering the set to *cut 
out* any videos that had been part of the original broadcast--e.g. Razzmatazz 
--leaving only enough beginning and ending to maintain continuity.  *NOTHING* 
that is in release anywhere is part of The Lovehounds Collection!&gt;  But I 
must say the porn scenario remains the most likely--certainly the most fun to 
speculate about, so thanks Fiona for your comments:

&gt; Peter, you may not have been far off the mark in your speculation about 
&gt; what would happen when the customs agents see Kate writhing around in her 
&gt; flesh-coloured leotard :)

Not to mention what they suspected when they saw the nifty animated Title 
that Chris supplied, "The Lovehounds Collection"!  ...  "Harry, look at what 
they are calling this stuff!  You finding any dogs on your tapes?"

       Oh, this is too ghastly--stop it, imagination!!

       Canada:  we, the Perpetrators of the Summer 1994 Video Tapetree make 
thee this vow:  you WILL get your *unexpurgated* "Do Bears..."!!

     "I hope people will think about this,                  Peter Manchester
           because I really do think           pmanchester@ccmail.sunysb.edu
          there's a lot in vegetables"              72020.366@compuserve.com
