 &gt;&gt;The reason I'm writing:  Rocket's tail

 &gt;&gt;This piece is what I would call " a masterwork." For many reasons:

&gt;&gt;First the melding of those Bulgarian women into a venue that is truly 
Kate's and not theirown.

&gt;&gt;Secondly, for Kate's ability to use 12/8 "(irish)jig/hornpipe" phrasing 
in a song that ends up as neither.

&gt;&gt;Thirdly, David Gilmour

&gt;&gt;Forthly, for her reference to Guy Fawkes (ok history buffs, it's your 
turn here...I know, but do you?)

&gt;&gt;Fifthly, and most important, her ability to have this vision and put it 
all together, as shrill as it might be.

&gt;&gt;Sixthly, I'm a felinophile, too

&gt;&gt;eightly, I love it when Kate suprises me or make me truly think,"What's 
gotten into the lassie to do this?"


I have to agree.  ROCKET'S TAIL is a masterpiece on an album of masterpieces 
(IMHO), and Mr. Gordon is very eloquent about this. I wanted to add a couple 
more thoughts on the subject.

This is one of those songs that grabs you and keeps you on the edge of your seat
before you even have an inkling of what the song is about.  Cloudbusting is a 
good example of that, as well.  The combination of styles in the song is 
haunting and effective, adding to the song's mystery.  By mixing of styles I 
mean the earlier a capella portion and the later hard-edged section.  They 
copliment each other, but you wouldn't expect they would. This song has always 
sent chills down my back, and I'm glad to see there are other Love-Hounds who 
also perceive its merit.

Re: David Glmour - I think his playing was effective, but a little over done.  
When, oh when will Robert Fripp appear on a Kate album?

Thanks for listening,
