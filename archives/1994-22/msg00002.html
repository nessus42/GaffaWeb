&gt;I don't think so...anybody can say what they want...as long as it doesn't
&gt;bring someone else down...Some may view the 'crap' crack as putting Kate
&gt;down...I'm sure that wasn't Drewcifer's intent...I also think that Drewcifer
&gt;must like ALOT more songs than he hates...

I adore KaTe.  I worship her.  I have the cover to The Red Shoes in three
different sizes on my wall (well...the bedsheet-sized promo isn't up right
now, but that's just 'cause I can't figure out how to laminate it).  I own
all the albums, most on CD and cassette, several mixes, a book, a handful of
singles, the Hammersmith video, and even a comic book.  Nothing at all 
compared to some peoples' collections, but enough so that you know I love
Her.  :)

&gt;It seems that people are not allowed to dislike or even hate a Kate tune
&gt;without being carved to pieces in this newsgroup...

No kidding.  Although I do remember that some people are pretty hard on TSW
around here, and I usually get touchy because I love TSW...but I don't bite
people's heads off...I just note that they're entitled to their opinion, but
they should keep in mind that others are entitled to theirs.  So I need to
spank myself a little for being so vehement.

&gt;There are many Kates song that I either dislike or downright hate too...
&gt;YWA would fall into this category, so would Violin, Eat The Music,
&gt;Wuthering Heights, Fullhouse, Sat In Your Lap, Mother (stands For comfort)
&gt;and Rocket's Tail (notice how there one from each album).

I like Violin a lot...I have no problem with ETM...I love Wuthering
Heights...I can live without Fullhouse...I love SIYL...I like Mother...I
love Rocket's Tail.  So yeah, I like a lot more than I hate.  :)  My
dislikes would include Passing Through Air, Fullhouse, Be Kind To My
Mistakes (sorry, everybody!  :( ), Walk Straight Down The Middle, and a slew
of Cathy demos.  And You Want Alchemy.  But my likes are almost
complementary (or is it orthogonal?) to that list...so don't brand me as a
traitor.  :)

&gt;Drewcifer was quite brave in stating his opinion...at least he admitted that
&gt;he didn't like a Kate song...so have I...how about you?....Are all of Kate's
&gt;songs perfect? (in your opinion, of course)....one thing's for sure, I will
&gt;NOT flame someone just because he or she might not like a song...everyone's
&gt;entitled to an opinion...there's no reason to bring someone down because
&gt;his or her views differs from your own...so...grow up and lighten up people!
&gt;..I think it's called free speech...

&gt;Way to go Drewcifer!!!!!  :-)

Gee, thanks.  All I did was get bitchy...but I'm glad it's appreciated.  :) 
Ya make me feel good.

&gt;Peace
