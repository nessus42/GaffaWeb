Gulp!  I got last-minute word yesterday that Tom of C-Side Records was
about to send out his pricelist and would consider including a 2-page gaffa
digest.  So I seized the day and sent him off the following.  If anybody's
offended, I don't know if I can do anything but apologize (unless you want
to appeal to him to use that whiteout...)  If you aren't on his mailing
list you should be-- his stock is all Kate, and way cool.  Tom Richards,
C-Side Records, PO Box 8456, Clearwater Florida, 34618 (813-461-4327).

If the format and content are agreeable, I'm willing to buy a few stamps
and get it out to other zines/clubs/etc???
 
==========================================================================
Who are the Love-Hounds?
Love-Hounds is a 5-year-old open-membership fanclub focussed around the
rec.music.gaffa newsgroup on the international computer network called
Usenet, and dedicated to the sublime artistic genius of Kate Bush.   Usenet
connects some 10,000 computers worldwide, allowing each of its ~1,000,000
subscribers to distribute news within minutes or hours to each of the
others.  Gaffa usually carries some dozen messages per day, keeping
Love-Hounds as current and connected as any Katefans in the world.

For those with email (electronic mail) capabilities, all r.m.g. postings
are also distributed thru a mailing list.  To subscribe to the mailing
list, send a friendly message to the "moderator", Bill Wisner (who's
actually in Alaska), via:
love-hounds-request@eddie.mit.edu

As an experiment in Reaching Out to non-Usenet fans, we will be offering on
an experimental basis a monthly (or so) digest of Kate newsbriefs and
comments.  Ideally we want to keep this a minimalist venture, so ideally we
would like to send the digest only to clubs, etc that have their own
mailing lists it can be redistributed thru.  Other solutions are possible,
though.  To inquire, contact Jorn Barger, PO Box 81988, Chicago IL
60681-0988.

Love-Hounds celebrate Kate's birthday (Katemas) each year around July 30,
with parties all over the world.  Tentative sites for 1991 (Sat. July 27,
except where noted) include:
BOSTON: Gregory Bossert (gb10@gte.com) (617-489-5127)

The big event of 1990 was the Kate Bush Fan Clubs Convention, November 17
at London's Hammersmith Palais, celebrating the release (in the UK, Canada
and Japan) of the sadly overpriced "This Woman's Work" boxed set,
containing all her albums in conventional form, along with two CDs (or
three LPs) of B-sides and alternative mixes.  Of the 1300 convention
attendees, some 50 were Love-Hounds, many from the US and Australia,
meeting face to face for the first time.  Kate spent an hour answering
questions submitted by audience members, sang a little song!, and announced
that she hopes to have a new album finished very quickly, having begun
composing at the piano again.
	She also claimed she's planning to "play some dates" at the end of 1991,
possibly including some in the US.  Old Kate-Hounds are protecting
themselves from disappointment with a wait-and-see attitude, having heard
all this before, but hints, rumors, and premonitory dreams are building
weekly, pointing to the possibility of a genuine World Tour!

Topics of interest to Love-Hounds include other alternative female artists,
and Kate-related others like Peter Gabriel and Roy Harper.  Many new
discoveries have been brought to our attention by Vickie Mapes (of
Vickie'n'Chris), whose radio show "Suspended in Gaffa" focuses on
alternative female artists, airing Wednesdays from 7 to 8pm on WZRD in
Chicago (88.3 FM), and Saturdays from 10 to 11pm on KKFI (90.1 FM) in
Kansas City.  Vickie is especially big on Jane Siberry, the
soon-to-be-superstar Happy Rhodes, and Victoria Williams.
	Ordering info for Happy's tapes: Aural Gratification, POB 8658 Academy
Station, Albany NY 12208. Tapes are $9.95 plus $1.50 s&amp;h ($0.35 each
add'l): Vol 1, Vol 2, Rearmament, Ecto, and Warpaint.  CD of Warpaint is
$13.99 and $2 shipping. UK: #8/tape, #11/CD, incl. s&amp;h.

Love-Hound Richard Caldwell has started a computer bulletin board service
that offers Kate-pix and current r.m.g postings.  The Big Sky BBS can be
reached by modem 24 hours a day at 614-864-1198 (1200 or 2400 baud).

Newsbriefs from Love-Hounds #1 (edited by Jorn Barger: no copyright but
please give credit to Love-Hounds!)
......................................................................
Q magazine's June edition (number 57) includes free sleevenotes for 'Hounds
Of Love'. [Andy Semple]
......................................................................
..from the April 19th issue of R &amp; R (Radio and Records, an industry
rag)...in a report dealing primarily with Prince: ".... The Purple One also
reportedly has lined up some BIG NAMES to to direct videos in support of
the disc, including actress Lisa Bonet, Columbia recording artist Kate
Bush, and noted film maker Spike Lee, who will likely call the shots for
the first single entitledWilling and Able." {Larry Hernandez-- rumor still
unconfirmed!!!]
.....................................................................
In the June 1991 edition of VOX magazine they have a reader's top 100. 
Kate appears at the following positions:
#44 Wuthering Heights, #60 The Kick Inside (album), #75 Hounds Of Love
(album), #95 The Dreaming (album)
Number 1 incidentally was Bohemian Rhapsody.

In the May 1991 edition of Record Collector (number 141) they have the
latest top 500 collectable artists.
Kate is number 11 this year down from 7 last year. Number 1 is (yes, you
guessed it!!) The Beatles.

The 'Simple Truth ' concert for the Kurds was on the tv last night.  Peter
Gabriel appeared with Sting to do 'Games Without Frontiers' and Sinead
O'Connor joined later to do 'Don't Give Up'.  To be perfectly honest, she
murdered the song,  I don't think it suits her voice. I was disappointed,
as I like her music. [Andy Semple 5-13-91]
.......................................................................
I just picked up the May 1991 new release brochure from Pioneer Artists. 
Kate Bush: The Whole Story is to be released soon on laserdisc here in the
USA!!!  For the very first time!  It codes the estimated release as "6/M",
which I think means the middle of June, but I'm not sure.  It will list at
$24.95 (MUCH less than the Japanese import), and will have the catalog
number PA-91-374.  The Pioneer EDP number will be 25375.  It's digital
stereo, CX , 1 sided. [Ed Suranyi 5-14-91]
........................................................................
 ...at the front of the new Music Mart section of Goldmine, there's a
classification index.  One of the ad categories, with number 5085, is "Kate
Bush".  This is interesting, because neither Goldmine's old classified
section, nor Music Mart when it was separate, used to have a special
section for Kate. [Ed Suranyi 5-17-91]
.........................................................................
I am a theater major and I used the words from NEVER BE MINE as monologue
material...AND GOT A PART!!  I remember they all kind of giggled when I
said: "I am now going to do a monological interpretation of a Kate Bush
song."  But after delivering lines such as "but looking back over my
shoulder...at you happy without me" got to them, and there was a hush in
the room after I was done.  Thank you, Kate!  You did it again! [Sean Judge
5-18-91] 
.........................................................................
In Greek 'gafa' means blunder... [Agathagelos Kyrlidis 5-21-91]
...........................................................................
1.  What is Kate saying at the end of Hello Earth?  Could someone post the
sentence in German and in English?
"Tiefer, tiefer.  Irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht."
"Deeper, deeper. Somewhere in the depths there is a light." [Richard
Caldwell 5-20, and Jenn Turney]
........................................................................
Lindsay Kemp (Kate's first dance and mime instructor) was interviewed on
BBC Radio 4 during the week of May 8th. In that interview he let slip that
he was helping Kate "with the tour". [Andy Marvick 5-22-91]
..........................................................................
Kate on "Suspended in Gaffa"
"When I wrote this track the words came at the same time, and this is one
of the few songs where the lyrics were complete at such an early stage. The
idea of the song is that of being given a glimpse of "God"--something that
we
dearly want--but being told that unless we work for it, we will never see
it  again, and even then, we might not be worthy of it. Of course,
everybody wants the reward without the toil, so people try to find a way
out of the hard work,
still hoping to claim the prize, but such is not the case. The choruses are
meant to express the feeling of entering timelessness as you become ready
for the experience, but only when you are ready."  (1982, KBC 12)  [Ron
Hill 5-13-91]
