 woj writes &amp; asks:
 
&gt;which brings me to a question: what other synKroniciTies have you en-
&gt;countered? the two others that spring to my mind are a bennigans-like
&gt;place in manhattan, kansas called "bushwackers" (i've got a photo of
&gt;the marquee) and a truck stop in northern eastern pennsylvannia called
&gt;KT's (i always forget to bring my camera when i drive up route 81 to
&gt;upstate new york).
&gt;anybody else have any others?
 
Many MANY years ago when I first became interested in computers I went
out and bought a Commodore VIC-20 computer, this guy of course had no
disk drive but instead one of those tape recorders that you would pop
a cassette in and wait 20 min for the program to load. One of the very
first cassette I purchaced was program where you could type someones
name and the computer would randomly insert the name into randomly
selected sentences (well it was a big deal at the time;-). This
program had some demo files so I ran them and it looked something like
this:
           1. The queen has very small feet.
           2. The queen likes her tea.
           3. Kate Bush is a singer from England.
           4. Kate Bush is a very mysterious person!
 
At this point in my life I thought for sure that there were only about
3 KaTe fans in the US, it just cracked me up to see her name on the
computer screen. Turns out the program was written in the UK.

               "I think quotes are very dangerous things!" KaTe Bush...
