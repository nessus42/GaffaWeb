&gt;&gt;They're in the CD booklet, unless you've got some new edition which doesn't
&gt;&gt;include the lyrics sheet...
&gt;
&gt;I had heard the song *without* owning the CD.  Difficult concept, I
&gt;know...

Listen up, you miserable weasel.  In the US, there have been several
different editions of the KT discs issued.  Some have lyrics, some don't.
I was merely curious to see if TSW had already become a cheapo lyric-less
disc.  So lighten up.

&gt;Sorry.  As I said, I was previously unaware of this group's existence.
&gt;I (apparently mistakenly) thought I could get some of my questions about
&gt;my favorite female singer answered.  I thought, since everyone here is a
&gt;fan, such a question, while probably repetetive, would not be totally
&gt;inappropriate.

Nothing personal, but EVERYBODY who wanders in here asks the same
question.  I'm allowed to be a little dismayed when it pops up again,
anticipating the flood of argument it will engender.  It's not your fault,
and I indeed took time to point that out, but you mistakenly interpreted it
as:

&gt;&lt;Wads of strange stuff (constituting roughly 10 times more verbal diarrhea
&gt;than my original posting) deleted.&gt;

Pure nonsense, dear lad.  Adjust your language parser.

&gt;I already know that.  Somebody less uptight answered.

Somebody less uptight than ME?  A biological impossibility, pal o' mine.

&gt;Don't mind Jon Drukman -- he's the group's resident curmudgeon.  If I
&gt;had seen your questions, I would have answered them more 
&gt;straightforwardly.  I daresay a lot of people would not have been
&gt;as amused, however.

I am not the resident curmudgeon; see below.

&gt;&gt;Also, imagine how it would sound on record:

&gt;&gt;	I don't know why I'm crying
&gt;&gt;	Am I suspended in duct tape?
&gt;
&gt;I just heard SiG on my walkman, and almost burst out laughing...Do you have
&gt;any other good ones? :-)

More than you could possibly imagine.  Try singing the lyrics to Wuthering
Heights over the Madonna song "Justify My Love."  Hours o' fun!

&gt;BTW In Greek 'gafa' means blunder...Could it be that THAT is what gaffa really
&gt;means?

No.  It means duct tape.  (ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION PATRICK!?!??!)

&gt;
&gt;Hey! I thought IED was the group's reigning curmudgeon. In fact to quote
&gt;Lovehounds' Quasi-monthly post: "Another welcome fixture in the group is
&gt;the numinous curmudgeon "IED""
&gt;
&gt;Obviously time for a vote :-) This group's not big enough for two curmudgeons!

Neil, you're a hip dude.  I'd welcome any suggestions of an official
title.  Certainly, I don't want to step on our favorite numinous
curmudgeon's toes.  Although actually the days of IED's _serious_
curmudgeoness appear to have passed.  I strongly urge everyone who can to
read the early love-hounds archives, back in the days of wicinski and
hoffman.  Now there was some INTENSE fun for those with the stomach.

&gt;I too liked Jon's very funny "explanation" about GAFFA.

Thank you.  That's not a tear on my cheek, by the way, it's just some
phenobarbitol-spiked herbal tea that splashed.

&gt;Perhaps we should devote a week or so of this list to the posting
&gt;of wildly inaccurate information about KaTe.  Imagine the confusion,
&gt;the laughter, the law suits!

I thought I had the monopoly on wildly inaccurate information.  But you
can certainly take a stab at it, if you like.

What's all this I've heard about Never For Ever being a carefully veiled
retelling of The Wizard Of Oz, anyway?

Follow the yellow brick road, in out, in out...
