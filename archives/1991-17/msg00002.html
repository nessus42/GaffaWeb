Here's a sample of what we could send out as a gesture of concern
for the netless.  Comments on format, etc are welcome.  Also, suggestions
of places I might (US)mail it to, where it will get redistributed
efficiently.
......................................................................
..from the April 19th issue of R &amp; R (Radio and 
Records, an industry rag).  It was included in a report dealing 
primarily with Prince.  Here's the part which mentions Kate: 

... The Purple One also reportedly has lined up some BIG NAMES to 
to direct videos in support of the disc, including actress Lisa Bonet,
Columbia recording artist Kate Bush, and noted film maker Spike Lee,
who will likely call the shots for the first single entitled "Willing
and Able." [oops, no credit]
.................................................................
In the June 1991 edition of VOX magazine they have a reader's top 100.Kate
appears at the following positions:
44 Wuthering Heights
60 The Kick Inside (album)
75 Hounds Of Love (album)
95 The Dreaming (album)
Number 1 incidentally was Bohemian Rhapsody

In the May 1991 edition of Record Collector (number 141) they have the
latest
top 500 collectable artists.
Kate is number 11 this year down from 7 last year.
Number 1 is (yes you guessed it!!) The Beatles.

The 'Simple Truth ' concert for the Kurds was on the tv last night.Peter
Gabriel
appeared with Sting to do 'Games Without Frontiers' and Sinead O'Connor
joined
later to do 'Don't Give Up'.To be perfectly honest she murdered the song, I
don't think it suits her voice.I was disappointed as I like her music.
[Andy Semple 5-13-91]
.......................................................................
I just picked up the May 1991 new release brochure from Pioneer Artists.
_Kate Bush: The Whole Story_ is to be released soon on laserdisc here
in the USA!!!  For the very first time!  It codes the estimated release
as "6/M", which I think means the middle of June, but I'm not sure.
It will list at $24.95 (MUCH less than the Japanese import), and will
have the catalog number PA-91-374.  The Pioneer EDP number (whatever
that means) will be 25375.  It's digital stereo, CX (whatever that
means), 1 sided. [Ed Suranyi 5-14-91]
........................................................................
 ...at the front of the new Music Mart section of
_Goldmine_, there's a classification index.  One of the ad categories,
with number 5085, is "Kate Bush".  This is interesting, because neither
_Goldmine_'s old classified section, nor _Music Mart_ when it was
separate, used to have a special section for Kate. [Ed Suranyi 5-17-91]
.................................................................
Sean Judge [5-18-91] says: ...I am a theater
major and I used the words from NEVER BE MINE as monologue material...AND
GOT A PART!!  I remember they all kind of giggled when I said: "I am now
going to do a monological interpretation of a Kate Bush song."  But
after delivering lines such as "but looking back over my
shoulder...at you happy without me" got to them, and there was a hush in
the room after I was done.  Thank you, Kate!  You did it again!
......................................................................
SUSPENDED IN GAFFA 
------------------
     When I wrote this track the words came at the same time, and this is
one
of the few songs where the lyrics were complete at such an early stage. The
idea of the song is that of being given a glimpse of "God"--something that
we
dearly want--but being told that unless we work for it, we will never see
it
again, and even then, we might not be worthy of it. Of course, everybody
wants
the reward without the toil, so people try to find a way out of the hard
work,
still hoping to claim the prize, but such is not the case. The choruses are
meant to express the feeling of entering timelessness as you become ready
for
the experience, but only when you are ready.  (1982, KBC 12)

     "'Gaffa" is Gaffa Tape. It is thick industrial tape, mainly used for
taping down and tidying up the millions of leads, and particularly useful
in
concert situations. Suspended in Gaffa is trying to simulate being trapped
in
a kind of web: everything is in slow motion, and the person feels like
they're
tied up. They can't move." (1984, KBC 16) [Ron Hill 5-13-91]
...........................................................................
1.  What is Kate saying at the end of Hello Earth?  Could someone post
the sentence in German and in English?

"Tiefer, tiefer.  Irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht."
"Deeper, deeper. Somewhere in the depths there is a light." [Richard
Caldwell
and Jenn Tunney 5-20-91]

==================================================================
"If a therapist doesn't dive down to meet the Wild Man or Wild Woman,
he or she will try to heal with words.  The healing energy stored
in waterfalls, trees, clay, horses, dogs, porcupines, llamas,
otters belong to the domain of the Wild People.  Therapists will
have understood this when they insist on doing therapy with a cow
in the room."  Robert Bly _Iron John_
