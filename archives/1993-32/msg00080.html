	The Unofficial Guide to Music in Greenwich Village, Sept. 1993

			compiled by Bob Gajarsky
	(gajarsky@pilot.njin.net)

	HELP!  I'm looking for people who have different
 tastes in music to make contributions to this list.  Specifically,
people who are fans of one specific artist and people who are into
either techno, rap, country, heavy metal, classical, or 50's-60's
are ENCOURAGED to submit stuff to me.  I'll include it in future
guides.  Thanks!

	The author wishes to thank several people who have 
helped put this together, either directly or indirectly: Laura LaGassa, 
Eric Porter, Michael Schuster, Andrew Russ, Stan Janet, Terre 
Thaemlitz, David Mandl, Dave Pirmann, Joseph Brennan, Jeff Spirer, 
Keith Miyake, David Bodoh and Steve Portigal.  Feel free to 
post/copy this anywhere,on any network, as long as the entire 
thing remains intact.

	If I forgot your favourite record shop, well, I'm sorry.  Maybe 
we'll include it in a future edition.  And, if the location is a little off, or 
they've suddenly closed up shop and fled the country, there's plenty 
of other stores to visit.  Most of the opinions are solely that of the 
author; some of the views are from the people who have helped 
create the list.  I have tried presenting the facts as easily as possible.
Comments are always welcome!

	If you get off the PATH train at 9th street, and walk east,
then south, then back west, you'll pretty much follow the directions
I've included in the guide.  The avenues run north/south, streets run 
east-west (West 8th street runs east/west, in other words).

	Getting into New York by the P.A.T.H. is the easiest method 
of public transportation.  It costs $1 each way, and drops you at 
Christopher St, between Hudson and Washington (far west side), 
9th St. and Ave. of Americas (6th Avenue), 14th St. and Ave. of 
Americas (6th Ave.), 23rd St. and Ave. of Americas, and 33rd St. and 
Ave. of Americas (last and final stop).  The first two are the only 
ones you'll really need for this trip.  
	
	Never mind the chain stores, here's the record buyer's guide:

	Revolver Records - on West 8th St., between Ave. of 
Americas and 5th Ave.  Particularly a must-see for Beatles fans with 
every sound, video and print item you might want.  Used discs, lots 
of books and magazines including foreign, out of print, back 
issues.  Good prices.  One of the top 4 for "rare live recordings".
Located upstairs, on the 2nd floor, at about 45 West 8th, on
the north side of the street.

	St. Marks Sounds - on St. Marks Pl. (as if it were East 8th St.) 
between 3rd Ave. and 2nd Ave.) The best place.  The widest selection 
of used CD's anywhere, at the best prices.  Sound impossible?  The 
$3 CD's have yielded some great purchases of discs that had just 
come out 2 weeks prior.  Used discs will run $5 to $9 as a rule, with 
$9 going to "in" bands like the Smiths, Depeche Mode, some imports, 
etc.  There are two stores; both have used discs in them, but the other 
(smaller) shop has new discs for $12 each.  On the south side of the 
street.  They also still have (some) vinyl.  Must-see. 16 St. Marks Pl.
**** CASH ONLY ***

	Smash Discs - somewhere betewen 2nd and 3rd Ave. on 
St. Marks Pl.  Mainly expensive.  Has lots of hard-to-find things. It's 
opposite St. Marks, and a few stores east of the next store, Venus. 
They've recently started selling some used discs in crates 
outside the store at $3 each. *** CASH ONLY ***
	
	Venus Records -	across the street from St. Marks.  Has a 
wide variety of used vinyl, and some used discs, and a decent 
supply of new stuff and imports.  Leans toward progressive rock 
(Genesis, Yes) and alternative music.  You put a definition for 
alternative.  13 St. Marks Pl. 

	Thompson's Square Bookstore: East 7th St. between 
1st Ave.  &amp; Ave. A.  The land of $4 used vinyl. All kinds of 
music (R&amp;B, soul, jazz, latin, pop, classical). Occasionally they 
have rare records in mint condition and underpriced, but it's a 
crapshoot.

	Stooz Records: East 7th St. between 1st Ave. &amp; Ave. A 
(almost directly across the street from Thompson's Square 
Bookstore). A fairly new store carrying used cd's and vinyl. 
Mostly the East Village alternative scene. Some good R&amp;B, 
obscure stuff. The $1 bin can occassionally bear gold.

	Downtown Music Gallery - East 5th, between 3rd 
and 2nd Avenues.  I had originally said " Ignore this place - 
it's out of the way, and they don't offer anything you can't 
find at Rocks in your head, Rebel Rebel, or any place like that."
Other comments were as follows, and I'd suggest you make
your own decision, since two people added these comments.
1) While they do not carry everything a place like Rebel Rebel 
does, they are a great store for obscure music that doesn't 
really fit into the pop alternative scene, but more the artsy 
crowd (ie., O Yuki Conjugate, Muslimgauze, After Dinner). 
They also have major jazz cd's. A definite haven for obscure 
vinyl. I used to hate this store when it first opened, but they 
have really been getting good things for about a year now, and 
their vinyl can really be awsome. I've found things that I never 
knew existed, and I'm a serious record store hag.
2) Any list of NYC record stores, especially "Village" record 
stores, should include this place.  For experimental music, "new 
music," weird jazz, etc., no other store in the city comes close.  
Period.  They also have FREE in-store performances by the likes 
of Marc Ribot, William Hooker, and Elliott Sharp.

	Dance Tracks:  Located on East 3rd Street, between 
2nd and 1st Avenues near the corner of 1st. Independent 
Underground Deep House vinyl, and Loft-style dance classics. 
Sometimes pricey with the collectors vinyl, but often a good 
selection. Rather small low-stock operation in the same venue 
as Vinyl Mania without the major record labels getting in the 
way. No techno (1 lonely milk crate of used stuff). Music for 
DJ's, producers and other people deep in the scene, not people 
looking for "House Music" )   Plan on going in and spending
time to listen for something you like. Friday nights are hot.

	Tower Records is on the corner of W. 4th Ave. 
and Broadway. cd singles are priced at 8.99 or lower - that's 
the best aspect of tower.  You might also want to check out 
Tower Video, Tower Books, but most importantly, the Tower 
discount room, that has cutouts galore, and "Nice Price" discs.  
According to one of the readers, "I think that you underate 
the downtown Tower store.  It is the absolute best jazz 
source in the city.  The range is incredible and the volume 
overwhelming.  For some reason, they really suck on "world" 
music."  Also, the other Tower stores are 1 block DIRECTLY
east of the main Tower store.

	Kim's Video - on Bleeker, to the west of Broadway.  
An incredibly diverse grouping of videos, and a good diverse 
selection of indie "alternative" stuff.  

	Second Coming - on Sullivan, south of West 3rd St.  
A good supply of "rare live recordings", whether on audio, 
video, or compact disc.  They also have a good supply of vinyl 
for a wide variety of groups.  The best book selection
(musically).  Used discs are average priced here, and new 
discs are overpriced. One of the top 4 on "live rare" recordings.  
235 Sullivan

	Generation Records - 210 Thompson St.  one block 
east of  Second Coming, Ooe of the top 4 for "rare live 
recordings", most of which are priced, on disc, at $20.  The 
regular disc prices and used disc prices are moderate. 
212-254-1100

	Bleecker Bob's - on West 3rd, roughly between 
MacDougal and Ave. of Americas.  Probably the best known 
store in the village; don't believe the hype.  Generally 
over-priced vinyl, for some really rare stuff. They've also 
got lots of tee-shirts here, but again, I like getting a lot for 
my money.  They don't give it to you. 118 W. 3rd St.

	Rocks in your Head - on Prince St. (an east 
west street 2 blocks south of  Bleecker) between 
MacDougal and Thompson, which are between Ave. of  
the Americas and 5th Ave. Also has another store with a 
similar title. It's got a solid selection of imports, and probably 
the best selection of import CD-singles.  Used discs are 
average priced - $8 to $9, with a decent selection.  Good 
selection of vinyl, and of groups here; geared towards 
alternative music. 157 Prince

	Record Runner - Prince St.  Top-notch selection
for import alternative (Depeche Mode, Erasure, Cure, Etc); 
live discs and CD-singles. It is a little pricey, but selection 
for specific artists is quite good.

	Subterranean Records - on Cornelia, between 
West 4th St. and Bleecker (bet 6th and 7th Avenues).  A lot of 
uh-huh and a little bit of  oh-yeah, to twist a phrase.  I wasn't
impressed by this place, and haven't been there in 2 years.  
It's got imports, it's got used stuff, if you're in the 
neighborhood, bop downstairs.  But it's not a must go to. 
5 Cornelia St.

	Discorama - on West 4th St., between Jones and 
Barrow (which are between 6th and 7th Avenues).  Used disc 
selection is moderate, with the prices ranging from $5 to $8.  
Some are $2; these are few and far between, however. A wide 
variety of compilation discs are sold here in the used piles. 
New discs will cost you $11 across the board, or 3 for 30$, with 
many discs on sale.  Bring in an ad from the Village Voice, and 
you get one new disc for $9.  Imports are incredibly high here;
$26-$30 is the going rate on most of the imports, although there
is good variety.  CD singles are generally 5.49 each here.  They 
also carry a good selection of cassettes, and a wide variety of
12" singles.  Must-see.  Plus, it's two blocks north of the Pink
Pussycat, but on the other side of the street.  Check for the sign
that says "New York's Compact Disc Headquarters".  Also, if you
have gotten the Village Voice, they often run an ad that if you 
bring it to the store, allows you to get ANY single disc 
for $8.99 + tax.

	Triton - on Bleeker, between Cornelia and Carmine 
(which are between 6th and 7th Avenues).  One block south of 
Discorama; new discs here are $10, when they have them.  Not 
the best selection, new releases often don't arrive until 2 weeks 
after their release date.  Not much used; some rare material (DJ 
mixes of stuff).  So/so store. 

	Zapp Records. 258 Bleecker at Cornelia. 212-366-4958. 
Specializes in imports and "rare live recordings."  Prices pretty 
decent, the average price for a IRLR ("imported rare live 
recording") is $20. Good selection as well-- mostly "alternative" 
some techno, pop, rock. They also have a LOT of british 
compilation discs; I noticed that the new British pop 
compilations were there, shortly after UK release.

	Vinylmania - One store, on Carmine, between Bleecker, 
Bedford, and 7th Ave.)  This used to be the best place for dance 
music, 12", etc. but ever since the consolidation, it's been much 
harder to find specific things, and the staff is  generally 
overworked trying to cater to their customer dj's. You may have 
to pay for the rare material, but this is where DJ's have been 
coming for years. A lot of import 12" singles here; an occasional 
good buy on the used discs, but not much.  41 Carmine

	Rebel Rebel - on Bleecker, between 7th Ave. and 
Christopher, I believe, on the north side of the street.  It's a 
small shop, but if it's out in England, they have it. $24 is the 
normal price on an import disc, which is steep for me (used 
disc prices are quite high - $10 is the norm), but the selection 
is unbeatable.  Plenty of hard to get stuff from overseas can 
be found here, and they're well stocked on all the magazines 
from England.  They also have a lot of American discs, as 
well.  319 Bleeker St.

OTHERS:
	Second Hand Rose's - on 6th Ave. (525), between 
11th and 12th St, I think. A grungy store, that has used discs 
at moderate prices, but I don't go up there because of the dirty 
atmosphere associated with it.

	(So-and-so's?) Vinyl Museum: Ave. A between 
St. Marks and 9th St. Pricey used records. They don't do much 
business, so they might not be around for long, but they have 
some nice collectors' items on the wall.

	Footlight Records: 113 East 12th Street  (212)533-1572  
Their specialty is shows and movie soundtracks, including lots 
of out of print stuff, and while it's not cheap the selection seemed 
impressively large.

	And in Hoboken, Pier Platters is two blocks away from 
the P.A.T.H. station, on Newark and on 1st St.'s (2 stores, back 
to back, between Hudson St. and Washington St.)  The best 
selection of U.S. and unknown bands, and the place that helps 
keep Hoboken bands alive.  On any given day, you might see 
Donna Croughn (Tiny Lights), Otis Ball, or other musicians 
behind the counter, selling records.  It's gone downhill in the 
past 2 years, but it's still better than most stores.

	Danny Fields, NYC agent (Iggy Pop, etc) has put 
together a walking tour of rock and roll sights in New York City. 
Free copies of the tour map, an eight-page guide to rock 
landmarks by  Mr. Fields are avialable by writing to: 
Tanquerary New York Rock-androll Trivia Map, PO box 511,
Gibbstown NJ 08027

	Want to go to someplace to eat?  Cucina Stagionale, 
on the corner of  Jones St. and Bleecker, offers the best Italian 
food I've ever had at incredibly cheap prices; meat lasagna,
for example, at $7.95. French waiter style service, and a nice 
internal environment. You may have to wait to get in, but it's 
well worth it.

	Joe's Pizza (corner of Bleecker, Carmine, and Ave. 
of Americas) has really good pizza, it's the best I've had in 
the city.  John's Pizza (across from Cucina) gets all the press, 
but I like Joe's a lot better.

	And Washington Square Park is a nice place to relax.  
Street performers are usually in the park, and it's got a lot of 
people.  You'll be offered drugs ("Smoke?") just like everyone 
else; don't think you're so special.

	Without sounding stuck up, New York offers the 
best selection of used music anywhere in the northeast.  
The stores that I rate as just so-so would probably be 
considered great elsewhere; I was told that Second Coming 
in New York is much better than the one in Boston, which is
"great", but I consider it (in terms of used discs) nothing 
special.  One reader says that it is well worth a trip up 
from D.C. Hope your record buying trip is a good one!
