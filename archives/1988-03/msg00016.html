Being a new subscriber to the Love-hounds mailing list I would like to
relate something that happened to my friends and I as my first
message. This happened a couple of weeks ago.

         I don't know how many of you realize that Kate was in NYC the
week of the Grammy Awards but apparently she showed up because she was
nominated for something like Best concept video for The Whole Story.
However she was also there to work on her new contract with CBS. We
heard an interview with her on local station WBCN while in the car. We
immediately got on the phone to CBS records who confirmed that she was
in the city but would not tell us if she was going to be making any
appearances. We called Tower records, where she appeared to sign
autographs when she was here in 1985. They said that they had no
knowledge of such a thing happening. So much for that.  A friend who
lives closer to NYC started calling hotels, asking for Kate Bush.
Finally he was connected to a room but the person was out. When he
called back later it turned out that Kate Bush was Katy Bush, a 40
year old American. Ed (the person calling) was of course very
distressed at this point but we convinced him to keep calling. After
about ten more hotels he was again connected to a room. Again the
person was not in and he called back later. This time it turns out
that the desk clerk misheard him and connected him to Keith Bush.
Well, that was the end of calling hotels.  As a last ditch effort he
called CBS posing as a limo driver and said that he was supposed to
pick up Kate outside a certain hotel (I can't remember which one) and
that she wasn't there and he was going to lose his job, etc...  Well,
they transfered him about six times altogether. No one has any clue
what was going on so that was pretty much the end of the affair.

        Does anyone know anything about the Kate Bush Club? I have heard
(second hand) that if you belong to this club you will get an invitation
to attend Kate's record release party when the new album comes out
(supposedly in November, I really doubt September but...). Is this true?

        Regarding the September release, well it could happen - NFE,
Dreaming, and HOL were all released then so it would be in keeping with
what usually happens.

      [	When I interviewed Kate several years back, I made the mistake
	of giving away to one person that Kate was staying in a hotel
	that was within walking distance of EMI's offices.  This led
	to her calling every hotel in a ten block radius, locating the
	correct hotel, calling up Kate, and notifying a bunch of
	lunatical fans....  Next time I should probably keep my mouth
	shut!  -- |&gt;oug ]
