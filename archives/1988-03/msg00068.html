     While admitting that Doug is probably right about the legality of
unauthorized interview CDs, IED will continue to call them bootlegs
until 1.) someone comes up with a better one-word term for such
grey-area products, and 2.) someone convinces him that there is any
_moral_ justification for the peddling of things from which Kate
receives neither a percentage of the profits nor any say-so in their
presentation. Crap like the new picture-CD interview disk are such
blatantly exploitive ripoffs that "bootleg" is too good a term for
them already. If they were to distribute them to real fans at cost, or
alternatively annouce plans to donate all profits to the SPCA, IED
would gladly applaud their industry. As it is now, though, they can
rot in hell.

	[ |&gt;oug strongly disagrees with IED's flawed reasoning.  Kate
	  participates in these interviews voluntarily.  The whole
	  reason she does the interviews is so that the interviewer
	  will sell her interview to someone who will publish it.  The
	  interviewer will make a profit by doing this.  The publisher
	  will then publish the interview (in a magazine, book, or
	  newspaper, or perhaps the interview will be broadcast on the
	  radio or TV instead).  The publisher will make a profit
	  by doing this.  Why does Kate consent to just giving away
	  all this profit?  Because it results in publicity and only
	  costs her a bit of time.  I, personally, fail to see the
	  fundamental difference between making a profit by selling
	  an interview in a magazine and making a profit by selling an
	  interview pressed in vinyl.  -- |&gt;oug ]

&gt;  2) What the heck is Organon?  I believe I saw a reference to it
&gt;  once, but I've forgotten where.  (For some reason Thomas More's
&gt;  Utopia comes to mind, but my brain is rusty and it could mean
&gt;  nothing at all).

     Could you be thinking of Francis Bacon's _Organon_?  If so, you'd
still be on a wild goose-chase (as IED was for weeks), because the
name of the home of Dr. Reich was misspelled -- probably (though not
certainly) by mistake -- in the _HoL_ liner notes and on the
twelve-inch labels. The name was "Orgonon", and came from the bluish
"life-energy" called "orgone", the location and manipulation of which
was the primary function of the original "cloudbusters".

&gt;       Organon was the New Englad home of Dr. Wilhelm Reich, the
&gt;       famous psychiatrist who went sort of bonkers after facing
&gt;       rejection by Froyd and other peers.  He was persecuted by
&gt;       the Nazis and the FDA.  The FDA eventually did him in.
&gt;       -- Doug

     Well, except that he was rejected by Freud (and a hell of a lot
of other peers) because he was already _going_ "sort of bonkers" by
that time. His major contributions to psychoanalysis are in the areas
of the therapeutic effects of sexual activity and in the theoretical
efficacy of psycho-therapy (mainly sexual counseling) for the masses
in a socialist society. In both of these fields Reich was already
venturing out onto the farthest reaches of his sanity, and the
majority of the psychoanalytic community in Europe, comprising a large
number of thoughtful, intelligent and more or less sane people,
naturally grew leery of Reich.
     In the U.S., Reich's publications rapidly acquired all the
hallmarks of advanced delusional psychosis (e.g., obsessively repeated
references to flying saucers and other UFOs, convoluted theories about
the physical and visible properties of "energy", faith in the magical
healing powers of inert metal and organic substances when molded into
an "orgone-positive" box-shape, etc. -- not to mention the relatively
mild delusion that plain metal pipes carried the ability to bring rain
when pointed at the sky!).
     On the other hand, the FDA did persecute him shamefully and for
all the wrong reasons. Kate's views about the value and credibility of
Reich's theories have always remained private. As she would have us
believe, she was simply inspired by _A_Book_of_Dreams_, the memoir of
Reich's son Peter. On the other hand, details in the song and
especially in the video show clearly that Kate did quite a bit of
research into the controversy surrounding Reich in the 1950s.

&gt;  3)  When Kate becomes a "blimpo" between albums, just how large
&gt;  are we talking about?  Industrial strength Alison Moyet?  Is this
&gt;  a major factor in keeping her from touring?

&gt;       Kate doesn't turn into Shelly Winters, but then she
&gt;       doesn't look like Twiggy, either.  On occasion she just
&gt;       gotten merely nonskinny, and on occasion she has gotten a
&gt;       little plump.  Whether this has kept her from touring, I
&gt;       cannot say.  -- Doug

     Nowhere _near_ Moyet-size, have no fear! The worst she's looked
in terms of chubbiness, in IED's opinion, was in the Canadian
"MuchMusic" interview with Laurie Brown. There the light chosen for
the interview was particularly unsympathetic, and incipient jowls were
clearly visible. Remember, though, that for a woman of Kate's
extremely diminutive stature a weight-gain of a single kilo would be
quite noticeable. She does not pig out.
     Also, a mysterious photograph of a new, lean Kate appears on the
cover of the latest Kate Bush Club _Newsletter_, so relax.

&gt;  5)  Lastly, would Mr. Marvick like to tear himself away from the
&gt;  Kate-Goddess for one moment and try to explain the significance
&gt;  of the title to Morrisey's "Suedehead"?  It has no direct ties
&gt;  to the lyrics (available upon request to all those who hate the
&gt;  guy and would never buy his records).  As a bonus, he might try
&gt;  to throw in how the video relates to all this (you know, Morrisey
&gt;  in a bathtub, on a tractor, defiling James Dean's grave, etc).

     Sorry, Peter, and no offense intended, but no, he wouldn't like
to tear himself away, at least not for Morrisey. In IED's view,
Morrisey is a tiresome and extremely limited musical talent with far
too much overt love of himself for his own good, and a twee,
self-indulgent style of delivery that palls in seconds.  So sorry, but
adoration of the Kate-Goddess will continue unabated from this
location until further notice. He was flattered that you asked,
though.

	a little heat....  -- |&gt;oug ]
