&gt;&gt; Works at the Chips Shop Down the Corner," or something like that
&gt;&gt;              *********

&gt; For shame IED, chip shop or chippy please. 8-)

&gt;&gt; (Neil Calton might be able to help out here?), and...

    IED is pink with embarassment over his breach of idiom, Neil, but
seeing that his faith in your knowledge was well founded, he has
retained the will to live. Perhaps you will take pity on the ignorance
of this American, who is still slave to that ignoble Yankee term
"french fry"...

&gt;    The latest issue of Homeground has just appeared featuring almost as
&gt; many mentions for IED as for Kate. Well done that man. Bags of good
&gt; information in this plus a mention for Love-hounds courtesy of the
&gt; aforementioned Mr Marvick.  Buy it now!

     Thanks for the mention, Neil. You make IED feel a cad for
complaining (elsewhere in Love-Hounds) about the slight inaccuracies
in transcription which _Homeground_'s editors unfortunately committed.
He should be grateful for whatever recognition his tiresome
submissions elicit from that august press. (Sorry, just finished
watching another episode of _Rumpole_, and it's catching.)

&gt;     Finally, a (controversial?) plea from a desperate man: Why, why, why
&gt; does Kate give her songs to third rate movies like "She's having a
&gt; Sprog" yet does not make this music available on singles for her fans
&gt; in GB and the world?

     Not at all controversial, IED shouldn't think. Good question,
really. The _NME_ did say a UK release (of the LP, anyway) was
imminent, but you're right. It is a tall order to expect the average
self-respecting Kate fan to pay for the drek that fills most of the
_She's Snogging a Sprog_ LP just so as to get one song.  Let's give
them a bit more time, however. _This Woman's Work_ could still
materialise as the follow-up single. Unlikely but possible, eh?
