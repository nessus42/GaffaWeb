     Glad to hear Liz feels at home in Love-Houndsland. A big welcome
is extended to Lizooshka!

&gt; Kate would probably kill me for it, but a tape I made of my remixes
&gt; was my favorite tape to load into my Walkman and listen to while
&gt; going to the grocery store--takes your mind off the price of food
&gt; these days, I tell ya! :-)

     Kate would never kill anyone! She's a sweetie.

&gt;     Well, I've rambled enough, and I'm sure this will get edited to
&gt; pieces, so I'll be off. Maybe someday I'll get back in touch and
&gt; tell y'all about the perfect master's thesis, assuming you could get
&gt; someone to approve it-- humor in Kate's music.

&gt; -- Lizooshka

     A great idea, but it sounds like a lot of work. If you don't get
it approved, Love-Hounds will still accept it.  And if you do write on
the subject, the WSI Press would probably be interested in publishing
it...

&gt;         Andy, I think your first reading [of "All The Love"] is
&gt;    really stretching it!  For one, it is incredibly awkward. The
&gt;    final conclusion, "I'll give them what they want to hear" being
&gt;    presented in the middle of the paragraph with no audible
&gt;    indicator that this is the conclusion? The conclusion at the end
&gt;    of the paragraph with the very audible "So" to indicate that it
&gt;    is a conclusion, not being the real conclusion?  You'll have to
&gt;    do better than that!  Also, I do not think that anyone would
&gt;    maintain that "telling people what they want to hear" is a good
&gt;    thing.  -- |&gt;oug

     Oh.

     Never mind.

     (You're very convincing about this one, |&gt;oug.  IED was
definitely stretching it -- but it was kind of fun for a while.)
