        Propaganda is no longer. They only had one album out but if
you're willing to pay A LOT of money you can get a CD compilation
called (I think) "Wishful Thinking" which is made up of lots of
remixes. The lead singer is now in a group called Act. I really love
Propaganda but I find Act to be rather boring. Apparently most
Propaganda fans agree. At the first show for her recent UK tour, she
filled about 200 seats of a 3000 seater.  Act does have an album out
but I don't think its been released here yet.  I can't remember the
name of it but I've been told by several sources that it contains a
Smiths cover.

        Colourbox on the other hand are still together and are doing
some very interesting things. They have one album out called
'Colourbox' but they also have a compilation CD out which includes the
Breakdown 12", Baby I Love You So 12", The Official Colourbox World
Cup Theme 12", and an early mini L.P..  I think their best work to
date is called 'Hot Doggie' and it appears on the 'Lonely Is An
Eyesore' compilation.

        Right now, members of Colourbox are at the head of the
sampling controversy that is all the rage in Britian, for they have
taken part in the MARRS collaboration - 'Pump Up The Volume'.
Apparently there will be a followup to PUTV but I don't know if
Colourbox will have anything to do with it.

        And Doug, you are right, it IS Tackhead Tape Time.
