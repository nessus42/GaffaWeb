<PRE>
I've been reading the Love-Hounds for quite awhile now, and I've been storing
up a few questions for the Kate-intelligentsia-that-be.

	1)  If Kate is so very much the perfectionist on her albums, why
	was Lionheart released so quickly?  Did others push her to follow
	up on her initial success before she might have wanted to?

	   [ Yes, the record company pressured her into a quickly
	     released album.  Kate did not yet manage to wrangle
	     control away from the record company.  *The Kick Inside*
	     was also to a large degree not controlled by Kate, but
	     this album, however, was far from rushed.  By the time of
	     *Never for Ever*, Kate got control over most things, and
	     by *The Dreaming*, she had complete control.  -- |&gt;oug ]

	2)  What the heck is Organon?  I believe I saw a reference to it
	once, but I've forgotten where.  (For some reason Thomas More's
	Utopia comes to mind, but my brain is rusty and it could mean
	nothing at all).

	   [ Organon was the New Englad home of Dr. Wilhelm Reich, the
	     famous psychiatrist who went sort of bonkers after facing
	     rejection by Froyd and other peers.  He was persecuted by
	     the Nazis and the FDA.  The FDA eventually did him in.
	     -- |&gt;oug ]

	3)  When Kate becomes a "blimpo" between albums, just how large
	are we talking about?  Industrial strength Alison Moyet?  Is this
	a major factor in keeping her from touring?

	   [ Kate doesn't turn into Shelly Winters, but then she
	     doesn't look like Twiggy, either.  On occasion she just
	     gotten merely nonskinny, and on occasion she has gotten a
	     little plump.  Whether this has kept her from touring, I
	     cannot say.  -- |&gt;oug ]

And now for a couple questions not directly related to Kate-

	4) What is the story behind WFNX in Boston?  I visited Harvard
	a couple of weeks ago, and I was immediately hooked to the
	station.  Is it actually college radio (I think not)?  It's
	the best station I've ever heard, up ahead of San Diego's 91X
	(of course, the size of this sample is small- I hate KALX, and
	KUSF and KZSU are out of the range of my receiver).

	   [ WFNX is a commercial station, but it's rotation list is
	     created by the DJ's, rather than from pop or AOR charts.
	     What the DJ's pick for their rotation lists, however,
	     seems to be very heavily influenced by College record
	     charts, such as found in Rockpool or the CMJ.  -- |&gt;oug ]

	5)  Lastly, would Mr. Marvick like to tear himself away from the
	Kate-Goddess for one moment and try to explain the significance
	of the title to Morrisey's "Suedehead"?  It has no direct ties
	to the lyrics (available upon request to all those who hate the
	guy and would never buy his records).  As a bonus, he might try
	to throw in how the video relates to all this (you know, Morrisey
	in a bathtub, on a tractor, defiling James Dean's grave, etc).

Thanks.

I sure hope this first attempt at posting works.
