<PRE>
       On the occasion of All Hallow's Eve, it is my great pleasure to 
announce that the main U.S. branch of the official Lovehounds Collection 
Tapetree returns for a two-week mop-up operation.

       From the steady arrival of posts asking about it, it is clear to Chris 
Williams, Master Compiler and Lord of Hosts, Tom Estes our esteemed Dubmaster 
extraordinaire, Cindy Loiselle at the Assignment and Dispatch desk, and 
myself your humble Announcer, that many worthy Love-Hounds/Gaffans missed the 
original Tapetree last summer not out of sloth or inattention, but because 
they were students away from their accounts, or are new to the newsgroup.

       So for you all:  Happy Halloween and LISTEN UP!:

       If you want to be a leaf in The Lovehounds Collection Mop-Up run, send 
e-mail to Cindy Loiselle

                     cindy@aai.com

no later than 4:00pm EST Friday, November 11.  Applications that miss that 
deadline cannot be accommodated.  Please note:  Cindy will *not begin 
replying* until Monday of next week, November 7.  But it would be useful for 
you to write her earlier, starting now, since that will give us a chance by 
next weekend to get some sense of the scale of the interest.  If we are not 
already swamped, I can repeat this announcement then.  &lt;Additional note:  
aai.com does not accept network FINGER inquiries; you will not be able to 
confirm that address, or be sure that your application has been received, 
until Cindy begins working on this project next week.  But have faith; we 
won't lose you!&gt;

       Cindy will e-mail you back with the address to send your blank tapes 
to, and instructions on how to proceed.  Basically, you will send two T-120 
blank tapes in a *stamped* addressed return mailer to the address you are 
given.  Plan to use Priority Mail (second day delivery) to send your tapes, 
and do so *immediately* after you have been assigned to a dub site, because 
tapes arriving later than Friday, November 18 *cannot be processed*!! 

       In all Kately affability and friendliness, I must stress that the 
deadlines here announced--Friday, November 11 for applications, and Friday, 
November 18 for your tapes to *arrive* at your dub site--are FIRM and will be 
strictly enforced.  Each of us who are undertaking this project is arguably 
dead stone crazy to be doing so.  We absolutely must confine our efforts 
within fixed dates.

       I won't take up bandwidth here to list the whole contents of The 
Lovehounds Collection.  Suffice to say that it is 4 hours of interviews and 
TV performances, both live and lipsynched, from 1979 through 1992, including 
the whole December '79 Christmas show `Kate', the videos made at De Efteling 
for Dutch TV, the Saturday Night Live performances, and the unedited 
`NightFlight' interview.  It's basically pretty simple:  if you don't have 
it, you want it.

       Reminder also:  as Chris pointed out at some length the other week, 
*none* of the material in The Lovehounds Collection is in release anywhere, 
ever has been in release, or to our knowledge is planned for release (except 
obviously for the songs themselves).  When videos that are still in release 
were part of a TV appearance by Kate, Chris edited out all but their first 
and last few frames.

       Finally, a word for Love-Hounds in Canada or in the PAL world:  none 
of us, especially not me, who undertook it last summer, have the time to make 
the inquiries and arrange to logistics to organize outside the NTSC/US postal 
service framework for this special mop-up cruise.  Nothing prevents 
volunteers from making themselves available in other countries; we are only 
in a position to volunteer ourselves, however.  There are dozens of copies of 
the set in Canada, Europe, and Australia.  Post an inquiry, and perhaps 
someone will be able to help you.  I am working on getting both PostScript 
printer file and ASCII versions of the tracklists and other printed materials 
ready for e-mail distribution, perhaps even on one of our FTP sites, before 
Thanksgiving.  I trust that with that assistance, the tapetree can continue 
to exfoliate everywhere that it has been planted--something that has our 
blessing and strong encouragement.
