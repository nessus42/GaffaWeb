Well, I'm back from the Chicago Showing of TLTCTC.

There's a lot I could say about the movie, but after reading the latest  
posts, it seems I've been beaten to the punch.  However, I would like to  
throw in a few of my own thoughts....

First off,  I didn't even know I was going to make it to Chicago until  
Thursday night.  I happen to be four hours away from Chicago, but luckily  
my brother lives in the Chicago Suburbs, so I had a second reason for  
making the trip.  

All I can say and perhaps the best praise I can give the movie is that  
despite the fact that I had to spend over ten hours of my weekend on the  
road just to spend about 45 minutes watching a movie, IT WAS WORTH IT.

Of course it didn't hurt that they did a drawing before the showing and I  
was one of maybe a dozen winners of a 12" picture disk of Rubberband Girl.

I could go on and on (and on) saying good things about the movie.  I think  
it didn't hurt that I'd heard some less than five-star reviews of the  
movie which had lowered my expectations; but even if I had been expecting  
a superb movie, I wouldn't have been disappointed.   I don't see any  
reason why anyone who liked TRS album wouldn't like the movie.  (as for  
people who don't care for TRS,  I still think a lot of them might enjoying  
watching Kate for a bit.)
 
I'm determined to keep this post short, but I still need to mention the  
fact that I did actually get to meet Chris and Vicki very briefly after  
the movie.  I'd kinda figured out who they were just from seeing Chris's  
Love-hounds shirt, but I didn't know for sure until afterwards.  It was a  
bit unfortunate that I was still dizzy from the Eat the Music segment and  
dazed from the culmination of my trip in the form of the movie to properly  
introduce myself.  Anyway, it was really nice to see some other people  
from this forum in a kate-positive atmosphere...

One more comment,  I was very surprised to see how emotional the ASIL  
segment turned out to be...I had truly expected MoP to be the one song  
that most affected me, but just seeing Kate's expressions during ASIL  
really tore at my heart.

One more comment, (ok, this is really the last one),   this was the first  
time I've ever had to sit relatively still during RG.  Probably the last  
time too.  As focused as I was on watching Kate, the song still made me  
feel the need to move.

in hopes that everyone who hasn't seen it already will enjoy TLTCTC as  
much as I have,
Steven Williams
