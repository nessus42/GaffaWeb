&gt;While waiting for pizza, we sat around chatting about various Kate-related
&gt;(and non-Kate related) things, and everyone was making fun of Chris'n'Vickie
&gt;(but I wasn't supposed to tell you, so you didn't hear that from me, OK?)

    No comment.

&gt;We then watched IED's copies of 8 of the Fruitopia ads.  If you took out
&gt;the goddamn type, they would actually be quite beautiful.  However, on most
&gt;of them, if I didn't know, I would never have guessed it was Kate doing the
&gt;music.  Karen then showed 5 of the ads (two which IED didn't have, including
&gt;the one they did for movie theatres, which, not surprisingly was the best
&gt;one).

   Um...without the words, the ads would have never been done and we
wouldn't have this music. So, as you might say, chill.

&gt;Then, our feature presentation - TLTC&amp;TC.  This is my third time seeing it,
&gt;and I caught many things I didn't see the first two times - including an
&gt;actual, coherent plot.  (I think IED will post later, and will probably do
&gt;a better job at it than I could).

   Kate "Fun things to spot." The 8mm video camera. The whale fluke.

&gt;Finally, we ended the night watching "Curse of the Demon" (AKA "Night of
&gt;the Demon"), the film where Kate got the sample "It's in the trees!  It's

   AAKA _Casting The Runes_.

&gt;coming!" as well as several visual images for the Hounds of Love video,
&gt;as well as a couple she used for TLTC&amp;TC.  Also, there was a scene in there
&gt;which was Stanley Kubrick "borrowed" for "The Shining" (which, in turn,
&gt;Kate used as partial inspiration for "Get Out of My House").  Also, I finally
&gt;now understand the line in the opening song of The Rocky Horror Picture Show,
&gt;"Dana Andrews as runes gave him the prunes/and passing them used lots of

   "...prunes gave him the runes..." 400+ times at the Rocky Horror. I
was a Riff-Raff and a Brad. My ex-wife was a Columbia.

&gt;skill."  Even the Kate Konnection aside, this is is a great film.  (Then
&gt;how come I never saw it before?)  Stev0 sez:  See it!
