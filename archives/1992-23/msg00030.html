        What Does Kate do next? 

        by Paul Donovan

        Daily Mail - April 18, 1979

        Movie men want to make a bat woman of Miss Bush

        The wailing voice and haunting looks of Kate Bush have already 
sold a million records
        So what's the next step of the 20-year-old doctor's daughter who 
this week is playing to sell-out audiences at the London Palladium?
        If the movie makers get their way, they'll turn her into a sexy 
vampire and bring shuttering frights from the girl who rose to fame with 
her number one smash hit Wuthering Heights.
        Elfin-faced Kate revealed yesterday: "I've had two script offered 
to me recently.  Both were horror films.

POWERFUL

        "But I wouldn't have though I was a vampire.  ANd I don't 
consider myself an actress, anyway."
        Kate, who dances sinuously on stage to a background of conjurer, 
smoke, and back-projected films, was asked about the other role in which 
she has been cast... a vamp.
        "I was very rebellious when the Press first gave me the label of 
a sex symbol," she said.  "I thought people would react to me as body and 
face rather than my music.
        "But it's an incredible compliment for a female to get, so long 
as it doesn't stand in the way of the music.   I"m not sure why people 
like me or why they want to see me on stage but it does inspire me that 
they do.
        Kate has no steady boyfriend and will marry only when she wants 
to start a family.
        It she hadn't been a singer, she would have like have been a 
psychiatrist.  Now there must be a script there, somewhere.




Kate Bush at The London Palladium

by Thomson Prentice

Daily Mail - April 18, 1979

        That conventional image of a girl pop star who recites her hits 
between breathless "thank yous' was hurled into deserved obsolescence in 
this unlikely setting.  
        Kate Bush lines up all the old stereotypes, mows them down and 
hammers them into their coffins with a show that is - quite literally - 
stunning.
        This quaint, cute suburban redhead turns pop upside-down by not 
merely singing but performing songs with explosive originality.
        Each number becomes a miniature play involving burlesque, ballet, 
and mime.  The cast is a troupe of dancers, musicians, and magicians who 
paint a whole kaleidoscope of images.
        Personally, I don't much for her records, her voice dominated 
with often obtuse lyrics is not a fulfilling enough mixture in itself.
        But add an endless repertoire of special effects, props, 
back-screen projections and sound effects and the voice becomes part of 
an entrancing whole.
        The relentless imagery, however, sometimes engulfs the intention 
of the performance.
        But what an ambitious adventure it is for a singer on her first 
concert tour - and how mediocre does she make most of her pop 
contemporaries seem.
