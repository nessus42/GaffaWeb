        Well, the San Diego Katemas 92 party has came and went.  It ended 
up including only 3 people, myself, Ray Russell, and a "new" woman, 
Susan, who seemed overwhelmed by all the videos and left with 
Cloudbusting, The Cathy Demos, a video, and other goodies.  Ray brought 
his must-see two foot model of the Cloudbuster that he sometimes mounts 
to the trunk of his car! :-) 

        Ray and I stayed up late, as I had rented three movies.  The 
first was the 1971 British TV version of Wuthering Heights.  This is the 
apparently the version that Kate walked into the end of as a child, which 
inspired her to read the book, which inspired the song.  I say 
"apparently" because Kate did mention that the version she saw had "a 
hand coming through a window" and I don't remember that in the film.  It 
started off a little slow for me, but by the middle it really got going.  
I haven't read the book (hey, I'm gonna get around to it, okay :-) but I 
assume this is closer to it then the older version, as it had much more 
"devious" motivations and is very different from the original.  Overall, 
it's a must-see. 
        We also watched _The_Cruel_Sea_ (which was an inspiration for 
_The_Ninth_Wave_), during which Ray fell asleep, which shows how exciting 
it is!   Actually it's the scenes that focus on the people that are 
boring, the "water" scenes are sometimes quite interesting.  There's a 
sonar sound throughout the film that's very simular to the sound in The 
Ninth Wave.
        The next day I watched _Castway_, for which 
_Be_Kind_To_My_Mistakes_ was written.  It's about a woman who answers an 
add to stay a year on an empty island with a man.  It co-stars Amanda 
Donohue, who just left L.A. Law (she was the lesbian character).  I had 
seen the beggining before Amanda joined LA Law and couldn't sit through 
it.  It was more interesting this time, though not that good.  At the end 
the male character said to the female character, "Be Kind To My 
Mistakes".


        Oops, here are some parts I forgot from my description of my 
Boston Katemas '92 trip: 

        While I was transfering planes in Kansas city, I met a guy from 
Bulgaria.  I asked him if he had heard of the Trio Bulgaria, of course, 
he had, and he couldn't believe that I had! 

        In Cambridge, Val and I saw a van that had a sign that 
proclaimed.... Wait for it!... That Stephen King murdered John Lennon!  
(Yes, the famous Stephen King).  It had documentary "evidence" (including 
photo comparisions) and on the back it said "It's no joke, folks".  :-)
