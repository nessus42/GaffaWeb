     Yes, Chad, I do have some stuff to add about the Tori show.  Imagine 
that, never would have guessed huh?  :)  There's not much I can add about 
E, except that his performance was somewhat uninspired, at least compared 
with Tori (I'll go into that in a little bit)  It was enjoyable to watch 
and listen to.  Now on to Tori.  An incredible performance.  Having a real 
piano for her music is essential, it won't work on a keyboard, so I too was 
excited to see a real one onstage.  All of the "extra" things on the album 
ie: the percussion, strings etc..  were not missed one bit.  She performed 
every song with emotion behind it.  To me, it was like she thought she had 
only one performance, so she pulled out all the stops.  This is where E 
paled in comparison.  I could see in Tori that everything truly came from 
within her, even the covers.  The bitching she did after stopping in _Happy 
Phantom_ was great, (those of us there to see her loved it) and justly 
deserved.  She said we were the worst crowd she had played for, my transla-
tion: there were more bad apples in this crowd than any of the others.  And 
the guy who yelled in the middle of _Me And A Gun_ deserved his own bitch-
ing out, he didn't get one, but I wish he had.  Something else she did that 
was great.  At the beginning of _Crucify_ the crowd started clapping on 2 
and 4.  Which I thought was real, damn annoying.  Anyway, before going into 
the refrain, she put a pause, and the expression on her face told me that 
she was trying to get them to stop, which they did.  :)  Once again, her 
performance was INCREDIBLE.  We did get to meet her!!!!!!! Which for me was 
icing on the cake, her performance made the drive worth it, meeting her 
just made it that much better.  In some ways, I'm glad that it was after 
the show, instead of at Camelot.  She's a really friendly, wonderful per-
son.  I also have an autograph (duh!) which I am contemplating framing.  
The whole trip is an experience that I doubt I will forget.
 
Chad-
     You deserve a stamp.  :)  You didn't post the address for the Tori 
Amos Fan Club.  I will do it for you.
