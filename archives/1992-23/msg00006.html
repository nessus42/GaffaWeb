UNKNOWN INTERVIEWS

        Articles reprinted in fanzines, bootlegs, or books, without the

appreciated.

in NEVER FOREVER 19.    
        Mike Nicolls interview.  Fall 1981?, trans. by IED. Reprinted in

MISSING INTERVIEWS

        Following are lists of interviews that I do not have access to.
Some of these are no doubt the same as the "unknown" interviews list 
above.   Any help in obtaining these interviews, or more information, 
would  be appreciated! 
 
 
MISSING PRINT INTERVIEWS

        THIS LIST IS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED COMPLETE, ESPECIALLY BEFORE 
1984.  Use this list if you are looking for Kate Bush articles, like in a 
library, use the "have" list if you are looking through Kate Bush 
articles.  It is based on the Medialog in Homeground (which I only have 
back to 1983) as well as the bibliography, which only goes up to 1983.
