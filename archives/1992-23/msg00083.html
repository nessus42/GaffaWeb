HIDDEN KATE BUSH SYMBOLS ON ALBUMS

        Compiled and edited by Ron Hill

        by Ron Hill, Andrew Marvick (IED), and Jorn Barger.

        All of Kate's albums have a hidden copy of the KT symbol.  This 
is an attempt to round-up where it is on the various albums, CDs, and 
cassettes.  
        
        KATE: That actual sign is an old Knight Templars sign and 'round 
the countryside you'll find it scattered on the doorways of churches and 
things and it was just very fitting because I used to be in a band called 
the KT Bush Band.  Katie, KT.  And it's just a theme that we've kept 
running.  It's a sorta motto.   (1979, Personal Call)

        It can also be seen on _Army_Dreamers_ (the patch on Kate's arm) 
and _The_Big_Sky_ (the flag) videos. 


CLUES

        THE KICK INSIDE: "Japanese style" cover only. If you can't find 
it (it's kinda whatcha might call "a bit obvious") then see an 
optometrist pronto...
        LIONHEART: On the left side of the picture.
        NEVER FOR EVER: LPs only.  Think "rose". 
        THE DREAMING:  Think "arm".
        HOUNDS OF LOVE: Back cover.
        THE WHOLE STORY: British version only.
        THE SENSUAL WORLD: Background.
        THIS WOMAN'S WORK EXTRA ALBUMS: Well, da.


ANSWERS

        THE KICK INSIDE -  In the kite on the original British "Japanese 
style" cover.  On the left wing of kite image, black circle symbol with 
white lettering.  Not on the American "Kate in a box" cover (as far as we 
know!)

        LIONHEART -  On the left side of crate on the front cover!

        NEVER FOR EVER -  Look on the gatefold, if it's a British LP; 
look on the inner sleeve, if it's an American LP.  On the right hand side 
engraved in the branch of the rose branch right in the bottom right hand 
corner (or thereabouts) (Don't think this inside picture is shown on the 
CD, though it could be somewhere inside the booklet).

        THE DREAMING - Front cover, just below (relative to picture, not 
relative to sleeve) second solid band on left sleeve of KT's jacket.
  
        HOUNDS OF LOVE.   Back cover.  Upsidedown in the cloth on her 
right arm, near the weeds, partially obscured. 

        THE WHOLE STORY - Only in the original UK vinyl edition: it's 
found only on the vinyl disk itself...  

        THE SENSUAL WORLD -     You may find it, in more or less accurate 
form, in a variety of spots, including the flower itself, Kate's hair and 
her collar-bone. But there is only _one_ spot where it _definitely_ 
appears, and where with proper lighting and preferably a maginfying glass 
the telltale signs of manual alteration of the image can be detected. 
Look in the background on the front, on the right side--and for the best 
results, use the original UK vinyl-LP cover as your source. It really 
can't be seen at all on the CD booklet, and it's not very clear even on 
the US LP cover.  

        THIS WOMAN'S WORK EXTRA DISKS - The cover photo _is_ the _new_ 
Kate Bush symbol integrating the astrological 
symbol for Venus (ie, the                 _O_ 
biological symbol for woman).              |&lt;
