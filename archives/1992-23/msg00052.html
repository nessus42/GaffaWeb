Printed books on Kate are numerous, more details about and corrections to
these books are available in the archives:

        Kate Bush - A Visual Documentary (1988).  Probably the best liked 
book overall.
        Kate Bush Complete - "Official" book containing the sheet music 
to all of Kate's songs up to 1986.  Also contains separate lyrics, a 
great chronology, many photos, and a discography.  
        Cathy (1986) - Book of photos of Kate as a child, by her brother, 
John Carter Bush.  No longer available. :-(
        The Illustrated Collector's Guide To Kate Bush (1991) - Book with 
details and pictures of all kinds of Kate Kollectables, fun even for 
non-collectors.  To order send $13.95 to C-SIDE RECORDS, PO BOX 8456
CLEARWATER, FL  34618.  Phone 1-813-461-4327.  C-SIDE is also a good 
place to get all kinds of Kate stuff, be sure to get on their mailing 
list.
        Kate Bush - The Whole Story (1988).  Despite appearances, not a 
sanctioned book, and certainly not the whole story.   Positive, but 
contains numerous factual and publishing errors.  For "The Whole Story" 
on this book, see Andrew Marvick's review in the archives.
        Kate Bush - The First Twelve Years [1992].  Homeground says: is 
another collection of newpaper and magazine cutting covering the years 
from 1978 in two volumes selling for about L12-00 in Britain and L15 
postpaid to America.  Details can be obtained via the fanzine Never For 
Ever.   [Who's address they list as 28 Millbrook St, Plasmar 1, Swansea  
SA6 8JY Wales]
        Kate Bush - With Love (1988).  Reprints of Kate-related articles, 
interviews, and reviews, some positive, some negative.  Interesting 
mainly to see how the music press has reacted to Kate over the years.
        Secret History of Kate Bush (And The Strange Art Of Pop) (1983). 
Intellectual (as opposed to intelligent) book about Kate's family 
history,
story, and fans.  Commonly available, but only recommend for the photos.
        Kate Bush: Princess of Suburbia by Fred and Judy Vermorel 
(1980?), again only recommended for the photos.  Hard to find. 
        Kate Bush: An Illustrated Biography (1980) by Paul Kerton, 
positive but error-prone book.  Interesting yet again mainly for the 
photos.  Hard to find.

        After being on love-hounds for a few months, most fans find the 
fanzines rarely have information they have not already heard.  The most 
common fanzines are the Kate Bush Club (KBC) and Homeground.   The KBC 
unfortunately only seems to come now when there is a new album out, but 
is always worth the wait as it has original articles by Kate and her 
family and lots of great photos.  KBC,  PO Box 120,  Welling Kent,  DA16 
3DS,  UK 
        Homeground comes out almost regularly and has news, great 
articles, stories, and drawings.   Homeground, PO Box 176, Orpington, 
Kent, BR5 3NA 
UK 

        Kate's session work for other artists include:_You_ for Roy 
Harper, _Sing, _Children,_Sing_ for Leslie Duncan (Kate is scarcely 
identifiable), _Flowers_ for Zaine Griff, 
_The_Man_With_the_Child_in_His_Eyes_ for Ray Shell, _The_Seer_ for Big 
Country, _The_King_is_Dead_ for Go West, _Sister_and_Brother_ for Midge 
Ure, _Do_Bears_Sh..._in_the_Woods?_ with Rowan Atkinson (from 
_The_Utterly_Utterly_Live_Comic_Relief_ album) , and _No_Self_Control_, 
_Games_Without_Frontiers_ and _Don't_Give_Up_ for Peter Gabriel; plus her 
performance of the Maurice Jarre/Paul Webster song _The_Magician_, which 
is only barely audible in the background of the Alan Arkin movie, 
_The_Magician_of_Lublin_.   Also, the never released title track for the 
movie _Brazil_ and _The_Spirit_Of_The_Forest_ benefit single. 

All past messages of rec.music.gaffa/love-hounds-digest can be ftp'd from 
the love-hounds archive at uuet.UU.NET (a California public access site 
named Spies in the Net, IP 130.43.3.3) in directory 
/love-hounds/archives.  Song lyrics, interviews, the Garden and 
Cloudbusting, etc are in /love-hounds/kb on the same host. 

        
There are innumberable GIF (picture) files available including pics from 
the 1990 Kate Bush convention, which include pics of Kate's house and a 
Love-Hounds group pic (lovename.gif).  Also, there are pics from the 
Cathy book (cathy??.gif), pics from the This Woman's Work booklet 
(TWW??.gif), pics from the 1979 Tour of Life booklet (page_??.gif), and 
uncounted more.

To view these GIFs you will need a program for your type of computer.   
Public domain picture file viewers include CSHOW and PICEM for the IBM, 
TURBOGIF and HAMGIF for the Amiga, and Giffer or QuickGif for the 
Macintosh.
 
GIF files are also available in 
/love-hounds/kb/pix/gif [and gif.new, gif_footah, gif.saintjohn, 
pix.hill, 
gif_tour_program, gif.newer, gif.fenger] 
 
If you've never used ftp, you use a program on your UNIX system called 
FTP. 
 You connect by typing: 
ftp uunet.UU.NET 
Log in as "anonymous", and use your username as your password. 
To change directories type: 
cd love-hounds 
"dir" will get you a directory, "get" and the filename will retrieve the 
file.  If you "cd" again into "archives" or "kb" you'll find the main 
goodies, with "pix" being another subdirectory within "kb", and "gif" and 
"gif.new" within "pix".  (When downloading gif's, set your transfer type 
to binary by typing 
binary 
at the "ftp&gt;" prompt.) 

Two priceless resources for Katefans have recently been made available, 
both of Thewhich are much more interesting then anything published: 
        "The Garden" is Andrew Marvick's compilation of reference 
material on Kate, [availible in love-hounds/kb/garden] including a 
detailed chronology of her life and career (much more complete then 
anything available anywhere else) [GARDEN01].  Also, a listing of all 
known Kate recordings, videography (which includes both official videos 
and the television appearances), and an extensive list of fan magazines  
[GARDEN02].  ALL of the lyrics (including background voices) to ALL of 
Kate's known songs (including unreleased songs) [GARDEN04].  All of 
John's and Paddy's [GARDEN03] interviews and articles for the Kate Bush 
Club Newsletter, as well as Kate's articles for the KBC [GARDEN05, 
GARDEN06].  Also included are about sixty interviews [GARDEN07 through 
GARDEN10].
        "Cloudbusting - Kate Bush In Her Own Words" is Ron Hill's 
compilation of almost 200 interviews, sorted by song, story, and subject 
order, forming the closest we may ever see to a full-fledged Kate 
autobiography.  It is available in regular text format, or in Wordperfect 
4.2 format, which makes use of Wordperfect's underlining, bolding, and 
italizing, ability, and contains an extensive index.  It is also 
available in MacWrite II, PostScript, and Word 4.0 versions.  (Eventually 
the unedited interviews will be added into The Garden). 
        There are also a series of Cloudbusting GIF (picture) files, 
which are located in love-hounds/kb/cloudbusting/gif.  A title page 
[CTITLE.GIF and a larger version, CTITLEB.GIF], a title page for Part II 
[CSTORY.GIF] and part III [CSUBJECT.GIF], a credits screen [CREDITS.GIF], 
and a pic of 3 inch disk label [CLABEL.GIF, and a b&amp;w version 
CLABELBW.GIF].  There are also pictures for most of the albums which show 
the picture of Kate from the album cover next to a listing of songs 
[titles begin with "O"].  There are also "alternative" pics for some of 
the albums, which show pictures SIMULAR to but not identical to the album 
covers [files begin with "A"].  There are also "full" pictures for some 
of the albums [titles begin with "F"], which are the raw, uncropped, 
pictures.
        Cloudbusting is available in /love-hounds/kb/cloudbusting.  The 
text version is in /love-hounds/kb/cloudbusting/text.   Filenames are 
cloud0.txt, cloud1a.txt, cloud1b.txt, cloud1c.txt, cloud2a.txt, 
cloud2b.txt, cloud3a.txt, cloud 3b.txt, cloud3c.txt, cloud4.txt, 
cloud5.txt, clouds.txt.  It is also available compressed with ZIP in 
/love-hounds/kb/cloudbusting/zip as filenames cloud045.zip, cloud1.zip, 
cloud2.zip, cloud3.zip. 
        For those that can't get Cloudbusting any other way, there are 
two Cloudbusting "mail chains", one Wordperfect and the other Text.  To 
get on these, simply leave a message saying you want to, and include 
which version you want.   You will then be mailed the disks, and be 
obligated to mail them to the next person who asks.  The disk package is 
on five IBM 3 inch 720k disks, and includes Cloudbusting, the 
Cloudbusting GIFS, and the non-interview Garden files.  (You may want to 
try the proccess mentioned below first). 

        A third, in-progress, book will be "Deeper Understanding - A 
collection of Kate Bush articles" which will compile the "best of" the 
Love-Hounds as well as a few articles from fan magazines and lots of 
published reviews. 




If you don't have FTP (file transfer ability) you can still get the files 
by using an FTP mail server run by DEC.  You send it a list of commands 
and then it sends you the files as regular mail messages, so anyone who 
has the ability to send and receive private mail can use this.  If a file 
is larger then 60k it will be send as more then one message.  
        If you want to GET binary files (GIF picture files, Wordperfect 
files, or anything that's not straight text)  it will send you the files 
in a special text format called UUENCODED, you will need a program called 
UUDECODE for your computer to decode these.  Note that this is not always 
the most relible way of getting files, ie you may have to do it several 
times. 
        To start off using this, send a message to 
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com, the first message should read simply HELP - don't 
bother with a subject line as these are ignored.  You will be sent back 
the basic commands and some examples, read this carefully (as much as you 
are able to understand).  Here are some specific examples for accessing 
the love-hounds archives, don't type the parts in brackets [].  Note that 
when typing in file names, upper and
lower case are important!

out, Richard Caldwell's Big Sky BBS offers the GIFs and many of the other 
files too.

"She really IS!  No, really, she IS!"

What the world or Kate doesn't need is any more "casual Kate Bush
fans."  What the world and Kate need is more FUCKING KATE BUSH MANIACS.
