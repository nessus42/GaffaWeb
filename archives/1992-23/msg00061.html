&gt;Together, the mailing list and r.m.g. form an informal fan club called
&gt;"Love-Hounds."  You can mail submissions, without fear of censorship, to:
&gt;An entirely separate group called WarmRoom has been formed, as both

     I've heard that there's a Kate Bush Echo on Fidonet, too, though
     none of the BBSes in my area access it.  :(  If anyone else does,
     then how "good" (accurate, devoted, friendly-vs.-flaming) is it?

&gt;Topics of interest to Love-Hounds include other alternative female
&gt;artists, and Kate-related others like Peter Gabriel and Roy Harper, and,
&gt;for that matter, anything sproingy, or not-so-sproingy.  Many new

     Peter Gabriel - my all-time favourite performer!  (Male performer,
     that is.)  A recent message on rec.music.progressive says that
     Gabriel will be releasing a new album called "Us" on September
     22.

     I've heard that there's a Gabriel mailing list in existence as
     well.  I tried Emailing for access to this list about a week
     ago, but I have yet to see any replies.  If anyone else wants to
     give it a try, or if they don't know about it already, the address is:

     gabriel-request@casbah.acns.nwu.edu
     Mngr: germuska@casbah.acns.nwu.edu : Joe Germuska
     More emphasis on Peter Gabriel. FTP archives available. Digest form
     available.

&gt;Kate's earliest band was called the KT Bush Band, (KT being readable as
&gt;Katie), and all her albums have had a KT emblem hidden somewhere on the
&gt;cover.  It can also be seen in the _Army_Dreamers_ and _The_Big_Sky_

     This question doesn't seem to be part of the FAQ, so I'll ask:

     Where on the various album covers is the KT symbol located?  I've
     only been able to find it on the cover to "Lionheart."  Then again,
     I never was that good at word searches.  (And don't even ask me about
     "Where's Waldo?")

&gt;Albums:
&gt;   Almost all B-sides, dance-mixes, and other incidentals are
&gt;collected on the extra disks, but not all.  Major songs missing are:
&gt;Dreamtime (The Dreaming instrumental/remix), Running Up That Hill
&gt;(instrumental), The Sensual World (instrumental), Be Kind to My Mistakes
&gt;(original soundtrack album version, much longer than and very different
&gt;from the single re-mix, most like it better), The Confrontation
&gt;(instrumental from the Comic Strip film, GLC)

     I'm surprised you haven't mentioned the CD-single "Aspects Of The
     Sensual World".  It's still available at US music stores at a
     reasonable price ($5 at the Harvard Coop, for instance), and it
     contains: The Sensual World (LP version), Be Kind To My Mistakes
     (3:03 long, dunno if this is the "longer" version mentioned above),
     I'm Still Waiting, Ken (also from the Comic Strip film, G.L.C.)
     and the instrumental of The Sensual World (also mentioned above).
