        THE DIE HARD KATEFAN QUIZ

        By Ronald Hill and Andrew Marvick

        Note that some of these are trick questions!

        1--Difficult.) A panther stalked through the jungle. Who or what 
was the panther?
     2--Intermediate.) What was Kate's source for the rhythm in 
_Jig_of_Life_?
        3--Difficult.) How long did the fall of Jericho take--be as 
precise as possible.
        4- Difficult): Name at least thirteen images of flight associated 
with Kate.
        5- Intermediate) Name any five songs off of The Early Years 
album. 
        6 - Intermediate) Who is Nicholas Wade?
        7 - Intermediate) True or false, Lionheart was first released in 
America in 1983?  Give details.
        8 - Intermediate) Where is Glaze Hill and what does it have to do 
with Kate? 
        9 - Intermediate) Name the Kate songs that include non-physical 
beings.
        10 - Intermediate) Name the foods that are mentioned in Kate's 
songs, and the songs they are mentioned in.


        1.) In 1982 Kate, in an article written for the Kate Bush Club 
Newsletter, described how she instructed her musicians to play their 
parts--generally not with traditional musical terms, but via visual 
imagery. In the case of Eberhard Weber's bass part for 
_Pull_Out_the_Pin_, for example, Kate saw "a panther, stalking through 
the jungle." She used a similar image later, when describing work on the 
_Hounds_of_Love_ sessions. IED assumes that the bassline, if associable 
with a specific character in the song, represents the Viet Cong guerrilla 
fighter, not the clumsy, disheartened U.S. G.I.
        2.) The rhythm track on _Jig_of_Life_ was suggested to Kate by 
her brother Paddy, who heard something like it in a recording he himself 
had made of what he identified as a Greek (or Northern Italian) "fire 
dance".
        3.) The "fall of Jericho" was a bit of a trick question. The name 
Jericho should immediately suggest the video of _Experiment_IV_ to all 
Kate Bush fans, since that film features a Dr. Jerry Coe in a lead role. 
When Dr. Coe arrives at the secret laboratories at the beginning of the 
video the time on the clock reads twelve o'clock noon. Toward the end of 
the disastrous fourth experiment, the time can be made out on a 
wristwatch--about 5:30 p.m. So, the answer to the question is "about five 
and a half or six hours.
        4) (birdsong in _Deeper_Understanding_ and 
_And_Dream_of_Sheep..._, _Ne_T'enfuis_pas_ ;_Night_of_the_Swallow_; 
_Kite_; Harry the Dragonfly; Kate's dove earrings; Kate as bat (back of 
_Never_For_Ever_); Kate as swan (_Delius_ video); references to "rolling 
over on the great big cloud" and to Superman, the Wright brothers, and 
astronauts in _The_Big_Sky_ (song and video); space travel in 
_Hello_Earth_ and _Keeping_Me_Waiting_; rocket-flight in _Rocket's_Tail_ 
and _Rocket_Man_; etc.)      
        5) Something Like a Song,  Need Your Loving, Davey, You Were the 
Star, Gay Farewell, Cussi Cussi, Atlantis, Sunsi, Disbelieving Angel,  Go 
Now While You Can. 
        6) Apparently, Kate herself.  This was the name given for the 
Editor of the first few issues of The Kate Bush Club Newsletter as well 
as the author of Leaving My Tracks, which was Kate's aborted 
autobiography.
        7) False.  Although there a quotes from Kate saying that her 
second and third album weren't released in the US until the Eighties, 
that isn't quite true.  Some copies of the album were released in 1979, 
and there is a picture of one in the Illustrated Collector's Guide to 
Kate Bush.
        8) It's in _The_Stone_Book_, one of Kate's favorite childhood 
books.
        9) Blow Away, Carmilla, Disbelieving Angel, Experiment IV, Get 
Out Of My House, Hammer Horror, Hello Earth, Houdini, Running Up That 
Hill, Suspended In Gaffa, Under Ice, Waking The Witch, Watching You 
Without Me.
        10) Wine, coffee, bitter almonds, and tea in Coffee Homeground.  
Seedcake in The Sensual World.  Cheap wine in Frightened Eyes.  Captain's 
biscuit in The Handsome Cabin Boy (there was a line with "tot of rum" 
that wasn't included in Kate's version). Marshmellows in In The Warm 
Room.  Cornfields in Never Be Mine.  Cold red beef, Game pie and colder 
beer in Organic Acid.  Drink in Ran Tan Waltz.  Hot butter in You're 
Soft.
