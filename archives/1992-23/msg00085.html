Ron Hill _shouldn't_ have written anything without a warning of spoilers

So now I'll go ahead and do it...

Spoilers ahead.  If you want to look for the symbols on your own, read
no further.  I'll admit to a serious amount of self-satisfaction for finding
the TD and TSW symbols without any clues... ;-)




&gt;ANSWERS
&gt;
&gt;        THE KICK INSIDE -  In the kite on the original British "Japanese 
&gt;style" cover.  On the left wing of kite image, black circle symbol with 
&gt;white lettering.  Not on the American "Kate in a box" cover (as far as we 
&gt;know!)

You are apparently on drugs, at least where the CD is concerned.

My original EMI-Manhattan CD had the Kate-in-a-Crate cover, but had the
"UK back" with the forest, kite, and KT symbol.

My import TKI, included in my box set, has the Japanese-style cover, but does
_not_ include the original back cover art.  There is no KT symbol on my UK
CD of TKI.



&gt;        NEVER FOR EVER -  Look on the gatefold, if it's a British LP; 
&gt;look on the inner sleeve, if it's an American LP.

I've always been annoyed that not all of the artwork appears in the CD.

&gt;        HOUNDS OF LOVE.   Back cover.  Upsidedown in the cloth on her 
&gt;right arm, near the weeds, partially obscured. 

This was quite visible on my EMI-America CD (and I think my EMI-Manhattan),
but is invisible on my import.


&gt;        THE SENSUAL WORLD -     
&gt;Look in the background on the front, on the right side--and for the best 
&gt;results, use the original UK vinyl-LP cover as your source. It really 
&gt;can't be seen at all on the CD booklet, and it's not very clear even on 
&gt;the US LP cover.  

Again, you're a bit off here.  The KT symbol (for which you do _not_ need
a magnifying glass to be able to tell it's air-brushed in!) was _exceedingly_
visible on my Columbia CD.  It is virtually invisible on my import CD.

Here's a question though--why is it that on my import HoL, the Ninth Wave
photo on the back of the CD is a miserable reproduction as compared to
the photo on the back of the liner notes?  As I recally, both of my US
versions had the same quality in both spots.  (for those wonder if I'm
really _that_ weird, no, one of the CDs technically belonged to my father)

On the other hand, the NFE and TD covers are much better looking than on
my original US CDs (my only complaint about the TD cover is that it's
on thin paper and you can read the print on the other side of the paper
through the picture).

Anyone have any comments are notice similar things?

Jeff
