Hey Folks,

Great news. Spurred by the AOL mail problem (which I'm hoping we have
already subverted with the new, smaller digest size trigger...), Julie
Meloni and Tom Neff put their heads together and figured out a way to get
the daily folk_music digests into an archive which now resides at Hidden
Water. I've wanted to do this for a long time, but Nysernet was unable to
allocate the additional resources for the WWW site (no disrespect intended,
I'm most appreciative of their long time support of folk_music which has
been copious.)

Anyhow, I had been reluctant to ask anyone else to commit resources to this
for no pay and Hidden Water was most gracious to offer those resources
unsolicited. I also hadn't grappled with the technical aspects of keeping
the archive up to date and Julie and Tom did ALL the work there. It looks
great!

The Folk Music Digest Home page also sports our current FAQ file and links
to Folkbook and Musi-Cal. The URL is <A  HREF="http://www.hidwater.com/fmd/">http://www.hidwater.com/fmd/</A>

Please feel free to spread the word and link liberally to this from your
own pages. Anything you folks can do to help people find out about all of
these resources is much appreciated.

I know that a couple of you have been saving the old digests. I haven't had
the space or the energy to do so. I'm not sure if they could easily fold
the old ones into the archive or not, but you may want to drop Julie a line
at &lt;dmon@hidwater.com&gt; if you have those old copies, just in case.

My thanks again to all involved and to all of you for you continued support
of this list and the music we love. This is another step forward and I'm
VERY psyched about it.

Thanks,
Alan

P.S. I'm continually asked the date that folk_music began and I'm actually
a little unclear on that. (In case you haven't noticed, I'm very
"future-oriented") Were any of you "charter" subscribers when I first
launched? The original address was folk_music@lpl.org, and that goes
wayyyyyy back. If you think you know the answer to this, please drop me a
line. I'd like to get this settled once and for all.
