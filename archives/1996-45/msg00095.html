I haven't posted the REALLY Frequently Asked Questions in awhile,
and it shows.

Here it is again:

     Q: What does "Gaffa" mean?
     A: Duct tape. 

     Q: When will Kate tour again?
     A: Never. Ever. Really.

     Q: What is Kate saying at the end of "Leave it Open"?
     A: "We let the weirdness in".

     Q: What are the words of that spoken word part in "Jig of Life"?
     A: You don't want to know. Trust me. 

     Q: What is the best album in the entire history of Creation?
     A: The Dreaming. Anyone who disagrees is an asshole.

     Q: Should I post binaries to rec.music.gaffa?
     A: NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

     Q: When is Kate's next album coming out?
     A: Your guess is as good as mine. 

     Q: What are the URLs to some Kate Web pages.
     A: <A  HREF="http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/">http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/</A>

     Q: Hey! The episode of "Saturday Night Live", hosted
     by Eric Idle, in which Kate was the musical guest,
     doesn't have Kate on the tape I got! Was I ripped off?
     A: Yes.

     Q: Which is better, the British, Japanese, or Canadian Boxed Set?
     A: You'll just have to get all of them and decide for yourself. 

     Q: What to do about spam postings?
     A: A few things. (See the REAL FAQ for this).

     Q: Has Kate ever posed nude?
     A:  HA!  You wish!

     Q: No, really!  The cousin of a neighbor of a co-worker of mine said
     he saw nude photos of Kate years before Photoshop was around!
     A: That was from a late-70's British edition of Penthouse with someone
     who's first name was coincidently also Kate who was a (supposed)
     Kate look-a-like.  Now grow up.

     Q: Is it OK to talk about other artists on Lovehounds?
     A: Yes. It is encouraged. 

     Q: Even at length?
     A: Yes. Well, don't go TOO far - posting multi-megabyte discographies is
     frowned on (and yes, people have done that). Use your judgement.

     Q: Can I even talk about Tori Amos?
     A: Yes, you can even talk about Tori Amos. 

     Q: What about Happy Rhodes?
     A: Er, that will be all for today...
