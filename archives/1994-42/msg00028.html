IED is happy to endorse Chris's comparison.  

In fact, he thought the musical reference Kate was making to Steely Dan in
"Why Should I Love You" was extremely clear, as are several other deliberate
references she makes to pop music past on side two of The Red Shoes ("A
Whiter Shade of Pale" in "You're the Only One", "Tomorrow Never Knows" --
particularly the rhythm pattern and the McCartneyesque bass-playing by John
Giblin -- in parts of "Top of the City", and Captain Beefheart in "Big
Stripey Lie"). He hadn't thought to mention these links until now, because it
had not occurred to him that Love-Hounds were not already aware of them.
Since Chris's suggestion has now been unwisely challenged, however, IED must
join the discussion.   

Anyone doubting the Steely Dan connection should listen in rapid succession
to the male chorus section of "WSILY" and to the first couple of tracks on
Steely Dan's post-"Aja" album "Gaucho".  The likeness between the rhythmic
sounds and chord progressions is unmistakable -- and makes very clear,
incidentally, just how silly are some tin-eared critics' assertions that this
track is largely the work of Prince. (Kate has already explained the limited
extent of Prince's presence on the final track, anyway; his primary surviving
contribution is the characteristic guitar solo.)

Also, Kate has herself at least twice named "Gaucho" among her favorite
albums -- she even played one of the most relevant tracks from that album
during her stint as a guest dj on a 1980 radio program. The link is therefore
as well confirmed as any reasonable student of Kate Bushology could hope.
