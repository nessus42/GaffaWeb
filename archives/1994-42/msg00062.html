Archive-name: music/kate-bush-faq-diffs
Last-modified: 1994/12/31
Version: 1.2.a minus 1.1.m

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ, excluding cosmetical changes.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action.  The full version is posted to
rec.music.gaffa only.  You can get a full copy of the FAQ by requesting it from
me (uli@zoodle.robin.de).  If you subscribe to the list (done by sending
email to love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net) Bill Wisner will also provide you
with the full FAQ.  If you can't receive more than 64KB in one piece I can
split the FAQ for you.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.  Cosmetical changes aren't listed.

-------------------8&lt;-------------------
1.1. What is rec.music.gaffa?

     On August 16, 1985 |&gt;oug /\lan thought it was time to create a
     discussion round about Kate Bush and her absolute artistic genius.

[changed '9 years ago' into the actual date]

1.2. What is Love-Hounds?

     You can also subscribe by using other networks: America Online,
     Compuserve, MCI-Mail, FidoNet, SprintMail, GENIE, Peacenet, Prodigy,
     Bix, Envoy-100, Connect, and others. You might have to find out how
     to reach the Internet. On Compuserve this works by adding "&gt;INTERNET:"
     in front of the addresses. Delphi and America Online also provide
     direct access to the usenet newsgroups, so rec.music.gaffa should be
     available directly.

[added some networks &amp; connectivities]

1.5. T-Shirts?

     There now is a second edition of The Official Lovehounds-T-Shirt
     originally designed by Steve Berlin [SB] who wrote the following lines.

     Intergalactic Garage (IGG) is selling them; they're both the exact same
     thing.  Mary-Helen's shirts are all gone now, so IGG is the only left
     source unless someone else is willing to do a third print.

     The IGG price is $15.00 + $4.00 p&amp;h (U.S. - ask them for non-U.S.
     postage), IGG takes Mastercard &amp; Visa.

     IGG has the shirts in M, L, XL, and XXL.

[removed ordering information via Mary-Helen, her shirts are gone now]

***************
*** 319,356 ****
2.2. Who is Tori Amos?

[rdt...]

     The purpose of the list is to discuss and disseminate information about
     Tori Amos and her music, and anything else that seems relevant.  Due
     to the heavy load of discussion and members after the release of Tori's
     new album, Under The Pink, Anthony was forced to make the list digest-
     only, that is there is no bounce mail.  A massive world tour has ended
     right now.  Watch out for limited editions of Tori's singles, since they
     ARE limited and the first UtP one, Cornflake Girl, was quite fast sold
     out completely.

[more up-to-date, tour is over now]

     There now also is the second Big-7 newsgroup for a female artist, called
     rec.music.tori-amos, though it's (unlike love-hounds and r.m.gaffa)
     not connected with the mailing list.

[previously gave the impression of rdt &amp; lh being connected, which is untrue]

2.3. Other mailing lists that might be of interest

[I completely reformatted this paragraph, and put an introductionary section
at the beginning which holds for almost all mailing lists on the net]

     Generally, mailing lists have a 'subscribe' and a 'post' address.  Use
     the first address to subscribe, the second to send messages to all people
     on the list.  Some mailing lists are automated, they require a specific
     format for the subscription, in most cases either a 'body' or a 'subject'
     line.  Body lines are single lines in the main part of the email message,
     while subject lines are, well, subject lines.  The subscription address
     is also used for UNsubscribing, those messages shouldn't go to the
     post:-addresses.  'Body:' means that the following text has to be send
     as a body line, 'Subject:' means it's the subject line. 'Your Name' means
     your real name, not your email address, 'your@address' means your email
     address.  Sometimes several lines for several services are given.
     Sometimes alternate (often shorter) addresses are available too.
     If a list is maintained manually it's noted as 'Manually'.  You should
     be more friendly then, and expect some reaction time (like nights,
     weekends, holidays) where noone is available.

3.2. Flamewars &amp; abbreviations

     Abbreviations commonly used on Love-Hounds include common Usenet
     conventions such as IMHO (In My Humble Opinion), ROFL (Rolling on the
     floor laughing), as well as sideways faces, known as "smilies" such
     as :-).  Also used here are the initials of Kate's songs, such as RUTH
     for Running Up That Hill (sometimes known as DwG for Deal with God ;^).

[wording changed, you could think we've been the only ones using IMHO &amp; ;-)]

     A new one commonly seen is /+) or |X( or any combination, such
     as |+).  This is, of course, Kate's film "The Line, the Cross, and
     The Curve" (Sometimes abbreviated to the less cryptic-looking TLTCTC).

[How long did you need to figure out what [-/|\][xX+][(Uu)] means? ;-) ]

[What is [-/|\][xX+][(Uu)]??? Answer: abbreviation for any of the following:]

-x(  -xU  -xu  -x)  -X(  -XU  -Xu  -X)  -+(  -+U  -+u  -+)
/x(  /xU  /xu  /x)  /X(  /XU  /Xu  /X)  /+(  /+U  /+u  /+)
|x(  |xU  |xu  |x)  |X(  |XU  |Xu  |X)  |+(  |+U  |+u  |+)
\x(  \xU  \xu  \x)  \X(  \XU  \Xu  \X)  \+(  \+U  \+u  \+)

4.1. Kate Bush - her career and Kate as a human being

     Yes, she appeared on Saturday Night Live on December 9, 1978 (With
     host Eric Idle of Monty Python fame), but the tape you can purchase of
     that show has her edited out!  Yes, that's Donald Sutherland in the
     Cloudbusting video.  No, we don't have her home address!

[Included Eric Idle reference]

     No, it was not Kate Bush but rather Kate Simmons who appeared nude in
     Penthouse several years ago. (These pictures were also used on the
     bootleg Dreamtime.)

[Creeps up at least twice a year, hence it IS a FAQ]

4.2. Tours

     Kate's only Tour (the "Tour of Life") happened in 1979, and fans old
     enough to experience this first hand are the lucky ones.  Kate never
     said she won't ever tour again, but don't expect anything.

[removed Steve's list of reasons why there haven't been anymore tours]

4.4. Basic Discography/Videography

     Early in November the next and last set of singles for The Red Shoes
     appeared, again in the UK only: And So Is Love.  Two CD singles (regular
     and with 3 video-prints), a Cassingle and a 7" picture single in a poster
     bag (giant 40"x60" poster) have appeared.

[adjusted to what really happened]

     The Line, The Cross, and The Curve finally appeared on video and should
     be available in good shops around the world.

[anyone found it in Japan??]

     The Cathy Demos (30 early songs, ca. 1975-77???, a MUST for every fan)
        Five of these are demos of songs that later appeared on albums.
        They are available on various bootlegs.  (Anybody have an early 80's
        album called THE EARLY YEARS?).
        Tracks (compiled from various boots - none contains all.  The names
        are not officially known, so there are some songs with more than one
        name.  Some names are from a radio broadcast in Arizona [KLN], the
        matching was done by [AR]): The Kick Inside (Brother) [note subtitle],
        Hammer Horror, It Hurts Me (A Rose Growing Old, Feeling Like A Waltz),
        Keep(ing) Me Waiting (Stranded at the Moonbase), Davy (While Davy
        Dozed), Disbelieving Angel, Don't Push Your Foot On The
        Heartbrake, Kite, L'Amour Looks Something Like You, Strange
        Phenomena, Scares Me Silly (Really Gets Me Going), Moving, Babooshka
        (2 versions), Kashka From Baghdad, Surrender Into the Roses (Coming Up,
        Carmilla), Oh To Be In Love, Rinfi the Gypsy (Playing Canasta (in cold
        rooms)), On Fire Inside a Snowball (Snow, Hot in the Ice), Dali (Ferry
        Me Over), Where are the Lionhearts (Lionhearts, On the Rocks) [NOT Oh
        England My Lionheart], Violin, The Craft Of Love, The Gay Farewell
        (Queen Eddie), Something Like a Song (In My Garden), Frightened Eyes,
        Never The Less (You'll Do), Come Closer To Me Babe (Goodnight Baby),
        So Soft, Rare Flower (I Don't See Why I Shouldn't (Pick the Rare
        Flower), Organic Acid

[Included Karen L. Newcombe's and Andrew Russ' (re)discoveries]

     Lionheart (LH, November 13, 1978):
        Quick follow-up to TKI, but still true Kate, i.e. great stuff.
        This album now is available in a special $80 "Lioness At Heart"
        edition, which includes a T-shirt, an album sized photo book, a
        poster and a postcard.  It's out of print now, and you might have to
        search a bit.  Caveat Emptor:  This boxed set, while not really a
        bootleg in the traditional sense, in not in any way authorized by
        Kate or EMI.
        Tracks: Symphony In Blue, In Search Of Peter Pan, Wow, Don't Push
        Your Foot On The Heartbrake, Oh England My Lionheart, Fullhouse, In
        The Warm Room, Kashka From Baghdad, Coffee Homeground, Hammer Horror
     Never For Ever (NfE, September 8, 1980):
        Shows the beginning of Kate's career as a producer and a general
        change of style away from the girlish high pitched voice from the
        first two albums.
        This album is also available in a special edition similar to the
        "A Lioness At Heart" box.  Also out of print it additionally includes
        a numbered certificate.  Again, this is not an official re-packaging.
        Tracks: Babooshka, Delius (Song Of Summer), Blow Away (For Bill), All
        We Ever Look For, Egypt, The Wedding List, Violin, The Infant Kiss,
        Night Scented Stock, Army Dreamers, Breathing

[Included info about the boxed sets not being official repackagings]

*** 709,756 ****

     This Woman's Work Boxed Set (TWW, 1990).
        The LP and Cassette version of this box have 9 LPs/CCs, but the same
        track listing.

[inserted, anyone have the 9CC box to confirm this?]

     The Line, The Cross, and The Curve (1994):
        The new 50 minutes film around 6 songs from the album The Red Shoes.
        TLTC&amp;TC is the first "full length" film Kate directed (even though it
        is only 43 minutes long, "full length" is used to distinguish it from
        the music videos Kate directed).  The plot is basically an extended
        telling of the lyrics of the the title cut to "The Red Shoes".  The
        film stars not only Kate, but Miranda Richardson (from "The Crying
        Game"), Lindsay Kemp (Kate's mime tutor and mentor), and Lily (of whom
        the song Lily was written for).
        Tracks:  Rubberband Girl, And So is Love, The Red Shoes, Lily, Moments
        of Pleasure, Eat the Music

4.9. Kate Bush World Wide Web (WWW) pages

     Experiment IV, the Kate Bush Home Page:
        hhtp://www.jrc.flinders.edu.au/ExpIV/

        Thanks for Richard Frost &lt;rfrost@jrc.flinders.edu.au&gt; for setting
        this up, this is the definitive Kate Bush Web Page.  It's still
        under construction, but it is a one-stop center for all your
        Kate information needs.

        (This page might be down at the moment.)

     The Kate Bush Musical Extraveganza:
        <A  HREF="http://actor.cs.vt.edu/~wentz/index.html">http://actor.cs.vt.edu/~wentz/index.html</A>

        This is done by Brian Wentz &lt;wentz@vt.edu&gt;, and mostly features
        digitized songs by Kate (two from each album), and a digitized
        interview(!) - which, at 10 Meg, is not for those with less-than
        robust computers.

        The Sensual World.

        This page links to all the above URL's and several other Kate-related
        recources on the Internet (including rec.music.gaffa).

     To use these services you need a direct internet connection and a WWW
     client, for example Mosaic.  WWW is a worldwide multimedia hypertext
     document system where you basically can use your mouse to navigate
     through myriads of documents all somehow linked to each other.

[Changed name of section, X4 isn't the only WWW home page about Kate anymore,
thanks to Steve Berlin for writing &amp; researching this!]

5.6. Hounds of Love

     Hello Earth:
        At the end of "Hello, Earth" the German words are: "Tiefer, tiefer,
        irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht" This means: "deeper, deeper,
        somewhere in the depth there is a light." They are not spoken by
        Kate, but by Gabi Zangerl, a friend of Kate.
        The choir part of this song was inspired by Werner Herzog's film
        Nosferatu that features a very similar chant.  Recently it became known
        that the chant originates from Georgia, it's a traditional lyrical song
        from Kakheti-Kartli, the easternmost region of the (former Soviet)
        Republic of Georgia, the area around Tbilisi, the capital. The song is
        actually best transliterated as "tsintsqaro" (At the Spring, By the
        Source or At the Well), a boy meets girl love song. You might find this
        song, also spelled as Tshintsharo or Zinzgaro, on some CDs with
        traditional Georgian music (eg "The Marvels of Polyphony in
        Sakartvelo", CD Ethnic Sound Series #17, Victor, Japan 1987). [W, CHB]

[It's not unknown anylonger where those chants originate from!]

5.8. The Red Shoes

     Moments of Pleasure
        This song is Kate's tribute of several of her friends who've
        passed away.  Murph is Alan Murphy, her guitarist who died in
        1993(?) of AIDS.  Bill is Bill Duffy, the lighting technician
        for The Tour of Life, who died in an accident while setting up
        for the tour.  No one (except Kate, as far as I know - [SB])
        knows who anyone else is in this song, especially "George the
        Wipe".  The verse about the "balcony in New York" refers to her
        meeting of Michael Powell, director of the film "The Red Shoes".

5.9. Miscellaneous

     Fruitopia Commercials
        Kate did the music for nine commericials only seen on American TV
        for Fruitopia, a line of fruit drinks produced by Minute Maid (which
        is a subsidiary of the Coca-Cola company).  There was also a longer
        advertisement seen in movie theatres which Kate also did the music
        for.

6.   The Archives

[I changed most of the addresses in the archive section to URL format.
Since this involves lots of paragraphs without lots of new information, I
skipped it here.]

7.   Credits

     The history of this FAQ starts with Jorn Barger writing a first FAQ for
     rec.music.gaffa/Love-Hounds.  Later Ron Hill continued maintaining it.
     After Ron stopped to post I (i.e. Uli Grepel) continued this with a
     halfway rewrite.  Even if I've written a lot of the stuff above it's not
     all my knowledge, it's yours, since I've pulled most of it from
     rec.music.gaffa itself.  To list the contributors in finest detail would
     be impossible, since there are so many, especially of those who 'just
     pointed out some errors' to me.  Steve Berlin, who spell checked it,
     and wrote small (very small - [SB]) parts of this FAQ.

     Some contributors that I somehow do remember (feel free to suggest more,
     I'll verify it...):

     AR:    Andrew Russ &lt;endwar@phys.psu.edu&gt;
     CHB    "Charles H. Baum" &lt;au766@freenet.carleton.ca&gt;
     JAC:   James Alexander Chokey &lt;jchokey@leland.Stanford.EDU&gt;
     KLN:   "Karen L. Newcombe" &lt;kln@crl.com&gt;
     SB:    Steve Berlin &lt;steve.b@TQS.COM&gt;
     TC:    The Crow &lt;thecrow@eskimo.com&gt;
     TC2:   Tippi Chai &lt;aj796@freenet.carleton.ca&gt;
     W:     Willtre &lt;willtre@aol.com&gt;
     YS:    Yamamoto Sozo

[AR, CHB, KLN and W are new entries, Steve Berlin worked a lot on it too]

Bye,

Uli
