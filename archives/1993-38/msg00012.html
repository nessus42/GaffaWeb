Just nonsense about Kate's appearance in the TWW lip-synchs (there are
two, very similar to each other, and both very similar to the MoP
lip-synch).  Kate looks absolutely fabulous in all three, and her hair
looks great swept up like that.

Admittedly, this is a silly subject for us to be getting ourselves
involved in, but IED's heard this kind of nonsense before, and it's
about time someone identified it as such. 

-- Andrew Marvick (IED)
   P.S.:  Did anyone mention that a photo accompanying the Q Magazine
review of TRS is new? It shows Kate sitting in a long pale-colored
dress (b&amp;w photo), on which is a print (possibly hand-painted?) of the
kind of fruits (sliced-open pomegranates and mangos, etc.) mentioned
in ETM and photographed on the ETM single cover. For the record, Andy
Gill's review is typically patronizing and ignorant, despite being
more or less positive.
  P.P.S.:  IED saw (but was not allowed to keep, alas!) an updated
version of the retailers' info-sheet about TRS.  It was a tinted paper
pamphlet which repeated virtually the entire original text verbatim,
including the list of magazines with "commitments" to cover the album.
The most significant changes were:  on the front, the new release date
is listed as "Nov. 2/9, 1993"; and inside, there is no longer any
mention of Kate's visiting the U.S. for promotional purposes (let
alone her visiting in September!).
  P.P.P.S.:  The advertisement for the album in Q has a much sharper
print of the album cover than has been seen heretofore.  As Karen
Newcombe suggested to IED earlier, it looks as though the KT sign
appears _twice_ on the cover...
  P.P.P.P.S.:  She is.
