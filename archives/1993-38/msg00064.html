I just received the programme booklet for the 37th London Film Festival.
Kate's new film "The Line, The Cross and The Curve" will be shown at
the Odeon West End 2 on Saturday 13th November at 17.15. The film is written
and directed by Kate and stars Miranda Richardson, Lindsay Kemp and Kate.
The film is 52 minutes long. This may explain the delay in the album and Kate's
concern to finish the film as she may be very keen to ensure that the film
is ready for the festival.

I have attended several films at the London Film Festival in the past and
it is very common for the director of a film to make a personal appearance
at the theatre and introduce the film and sometimes to answer questions
afterwards. I would think there is a good chance Kate may turn up.


Here is the synopsis of the film from the programme booklet.

We are delighted to welcome acclaimed singer-songwriter Kate Bush to the
world of images with this, her directorial debut. Although the inspirational
source is the music contained in her new album, her visual energy, flair and
use of colours is simply great. The story revolves  around two dancers
(Bush and Stewart Arnold) rehearsing for a show in a hot, humid room during a
storm. When lightening strikes and cuts the power, Kate is left alone when
suddenly a mysterious woman (Miranda Richardson) with bandaged hands and red
ballet shoes enters through the mirror. She tricks Kate into drawing three symbols,
a line, a cross and a curve, and handing over her soul in return for the red
shoes, which take her through the doorway in the mirror. A guide appears
(Lindsay Kemp), explaining that the only way break the spell is to sing back the
symbols.


The film will be showing with a "claymation" UK film "The Wrong Trousers" directed
by Nick Park.


Ticket prices are 6-95 (pounds). Annual members of the British Film Institute
