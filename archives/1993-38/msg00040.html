For those who missed the original Aspel videotape tapetree, I have volunteered
to help distribute copies to newcomers and latecomers.

Some background on the Aspel videotape culled from multiple postings by 
original tapetree root Peter Manchester --

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; FROM:  PMANCHESTER
&gt; 
&gt;      If you are only now deciding to participate in the tapetree, here's how 
&gt; it works.  [...] The general procedure is this:  you send your 
&gt; blank tape along with a self-addressed, stamped return mailer (use _stamps_, 
&gt; not metered postage, which is only valid on the date of issue) to the node 
&gt; person you have contacted.  This makes it easy for him or her to give you a 
&gt; quick turnaround--no trips to the post office, no sending money, etc.
&gt;
&gt; TRACK LIST
&gt; 
&gt; A.  "Moments of Pleasure," lip-synch of the album track for "The Red Shoes," 
&gt;     at the piano, on Aspel &amp; Company TV show, June 20, 1993.
&gt; B.  "Rocketman," b&amp;w video for The Awards, &lt;?date&gt;, 1993
&gt; C.  "Die Efteling" Tapes (AKA The Dutch TV videos): Six videos taped in the  
&gt;   Efteling Gardens (a gothic theme-park), Amsterdam, April 1978. 
&gt;        1. Moving
&gt;        2. Wuthering Heights
&gt;        3. Them Heavy People
&gt;        4. The Man With the Child in His Eyes
&gt;        5. Strange Phenomena
&gt;        6. The Kick Inside
&gt; D.  "Kate": The "Christmas" TV special, U.K. TV, aired December 28, 1979.
&gt;        1. Intro music
&gt;        2. Violin.
&gt; 		&lt;All of what follows, within the &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;s (descriptions here 
&gt; 		clipped from The Garden), did not make it through the 
&gt; 		conversion made for this master; there was no time to redo it; 
&gt; 		see technical notes below&gt;
&gt;        &lt;&lt; 3. Satie's Gymnopedie No. 1, played by the KT Bush Band as
&gt;        &lt;&lt; background for the two giant violins (Paddy and his friend Andrew
&gt;        &lt;&lt; Bryant), who mime an introduction for the next song:
&gt;        &lt;&lt; 4. Symphony in Blue. Sung live with the KT Bush Band.   Kate
&gt;        &lt;&lt; sings and accompanies herself at the piano.
&gt;        &lt;&lt; 5. Them Heavy People. Lip-synched to a live recording.&gt;&gt;
&gt;        6.  A cappella introduction for Peter Gabriel (Peter the Angel
&gt;	 	Gabriel). Here Comes the Flood, Peter Gabriel
&gt;        7. Ran Tan Waltz
&gt;        8. December Will Be Magic Again &lt;video drop-out at start&gt;
&gt;        9. The Wedding List
&gt;       10. Another Day (Roy Harper), duet with Peter Gabriel
&gt;       11. Egypt
&gt;       12. The Man With the Child in His Eyes
&gt;       13. Don't Push Your Foot on the Heart Brake
&gt; E.  "Rocketman," Wogan TV, color &lt;?date&gt;
&gt; F.  "The Infant Kiss," video made by Chris Williams in 1984 with clips from  
&gt;   "The Innocents" (produced and directed by Jack Clayton in 1961, with     
&gt; Deborah Kerr, script by Truman Capote from  The Turn of the Screw  by     
&gt; Henry James).  Kate has often said that her song was influenced by having 
&gt; seen this film, and she liked this video enough (in version 1.0) to call 
&gt; Chris personally to thank him.  This is ver. 2.0, with CD audio.
&gt; 
&gt; TECHNICAL NOTES
&gt; 
&gt;        Two general points.  First, for this application, mastering to S-VHS 
&gt; works; the sub-masters are indistinguishable on screen from the master.  
&gt; Second, time pressure is always an enemy.  By the time Chris could get the 
&gt; standards-conversions made and all the equipment together in one room, it was 
&gt; 6pm Monday night, and the last dispatch that could get the tape to me today 
&gt; was 8:15.  There was no going back on anything.  I take responsibility for 
&gt; enforcing the calendar that had Katemas as  terminus ad quem , and I thank 
&gt; Chris for keeping me posted and for his amazing composure as things converged 
&gt; toward DEADLINE.  He flew out of the studio with the tape at 8:06, and made 
&gt; it by 8:15.  Allow me also--this once--to thank the U.S. Postal Service for 
&gt; delivering on the service I paid for.
&gt; 
&gt;        The good news:  the new stuff comes through great!  Aspel/MoP on 
&gt; Jorn's tape is a second-generation PAL dub, and some graininess on that 
&gt; account is inevitable.  But it remains sharp, the conversion is excellent, 
&gt; and the stereo audio is excellent.  The b&amp;w RM is plain perfect, as are the 
&gt; Wogan color RM and Chris's TIK at the end of the set.  The Dutch videos are 
&gt; in state-of-preservation, which is to say, they are from an NTSC conversion 
&gt; done years ago that it doesn't seem we are ever going to be able to get 
&gt; behind.  The audio has been through a lot of AGC that didn't do it any good, 
&gt; and the video is a little smeared--though I was able to boost the sharpness a 
&gt; bit with video DNR keeping it from getting funky.
&gt; 
&gt;        The material as shipped runs 1hr 13min, but when Chris and I talked 
&gt; over the weekend, it looked like we were going to be up against the limit of 
&gt; a T-120 at SP, and we well might have been if the Christmas Show had come 
&gt; through intact.  I encouraged him to cut the nearly five minutes of vapid 
&gt; 'interview' that followed MoP on Aspel, and at the moment of destiny, that 
&gt; was Chris's call, and I completely support it.  As I watch the tape, I have 
&gt; utterly  zero  appetite to see Kate sit around and schmooze after MoP.  It 
&gt; goes direct to b&amp;w RM.  There is  no  blather in this set; plenty of that is 
&gt; in circulation already.
&gt; 
&gt;        The bad news:  the Christmas Show conversion is a botch.  It had to be 
&gt; sub-contracted for reasons of time, and when Chris started running it to the 
&gt; tapetree master, his heart must have died within him.  The transfer is almost 
&gt; too egregious to describe.  Mistracking is so gross that mistracking noise 
&gt; and artifacts are over the picture continuously.  At least because they are 
&gt; continuous, it is possible to tune them out.  But the chroma signal is weak 
&gt; at best, and in-and-out:  out, mostly.  Meaning, b&amp;w with occasional seques 
&gt; to a vague sepia.  And then head clogs blotted out three whole songs, the 
&gt; "Peter the Angel Gabriel" choral intro, and the video for the first bars of 
&gt; DWBMA.  A couple of redeeming aspects:  the picture itself is far sharper 
&gt; than the garbage version of the show that I already have, and the audio--once 
&gt; I discovered that the video-head track was misaligned so that I had to 
&gt; manually move the tracking over for this segment in order to read it--is a 
&gt; million times better than I have ever heard for this show.  Many of you who 
&gt; will be seeing this tape already have the Christmas Show; for those who have 
&gt; never seen it, this is a kind of viable preview.  But Chris and I are 
&gt; determined to get a Christmas Show transfer right; some of what it needs 
&gt; calls for frame-by-frame hand-painting of dropouts and morphing of missing 
&gt; fields.  Stay tuned.  And apologies from both of us for any disappointment 
&gt; this time, but louder ones from me.  I was Enforcer for the DEADLINE.

&gt; Subject: Over and Out
&gt; 
&gt; 	Hi everybody:
&gt; 
&gt; 	While some of you may still be at the mop-up stage, I am assuming that 
&gt; the great Aspel Tapetree adventure is behind us, so I am writing to bid adieu, 
&gt; and to pass along some excellent information.
&gt; 
&gt; 	On Friday Katemas itself, I got e-mail from one Tom Estes 
&gt; (sztestes@othello.ucdavis.edu), a katefan who had _just_ that day found gaffa 
&gt; and learned about the tapetree from my post that previous Tuesday about it 
&gt; closing as of 7/30.  He wondered whether he could still get in, and happened 
&gt; to mention that he had professional video dubbing equipment including a pro 
&gt; S-VHS deck, distribution amplifier, and 4 pro hifi stereo VHS slave decks.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Needless to say, I took this to be an omen!  With Chris Williams' 
&gt; blessing (now that he is back from travel) and Tom's agreement, I today sent 
&gt; the S-VHS Aspel master to him, and he will be available for any additional 
&gt; requests that may come to any of us.  For the time being he will serve in that 
&gt; role only, and will lurk on gaffa in order to contact anyone who happens to 
&gt; post asking about the tapetree.  But when school starts, he may post directly 
&gt; to bring the tape to the attention of people who may have missed it this 
&gt; summer.
&gt;
