Any midwest L-H'er who's ever paused to wonder when hearing about those cheap
stay-over-a-Saturday one way air fares around the country, should consider
jumping a plane to L.A. next week:

	New Music L.A. '87 presents
	American Premiere performance

	CURRENT .93.
	with Randy Greif (of Swinging Axe Productions)

	Friday, March 13th
	Charley's Obsession
	501 S. Spring St.
	Downtown Los Angeles, CA
	$12.50

I have also heard rumours of an `all-star jam band' with members of CURRENT
.93., COIL, and DEATH IN JUNE participating (also as part of NMLA87), but
this is currently unconfirmed.

In Other News:

My loft-mates FACTORY have gotten the opening slot for a Goldenvoice
SKINNY PUPPY show next month ... SP wishes to play two small shows here
(4/15 &amp; 4/16, see my Tour Dates) yet Goldenvoice only wants to put on one
larger venue show.  Visions of Promotorship dance in my head ...  :-)

Record news:
- New industrial comp. `Dry Lungs II' is out.  Put out by Paul Lemos of
CONTROLLED BLEEDING (as was `Dry Lungs', natch.).  Familiar names on DL II
include JEFF GREINKE, RANDY GREIF, CONTROLLED BLEEDING, and SEVERED HEADS ...
- CURRENT .93. goes mersh?  New single (Laylah LAY 18) has guest star 
appearance by Rose McDowall of STRAWBERRY SWITCHBLADE ...
- All right, John, I'm trusting you - new FUZZTONES LP `Live In Europe'; comes
with a free 7" flexi ... [better be good!]
- New XMAL DEUTSCHLAND LP `Viva' and 12" `Sickle Moon' ...
- Just saw new SCRATCH ACID LP `Beserker', anyone have it?  Review?
SA playing at the Whiskey next Wednesday 3/11 ...
- Charades time, Berkeley denizens!  Name the band from Frisco with a one
word name, begins with `T', sounds like a Japanese word; I saw it today
but have already spaced out the band name (real good, Greg - can't even 
remember a fucking one word name.  DUH ...).  How's the record?

Rock read brain food news:
- RE/Search Industrial Culture Handbook (Issue #6/7).  FINALLY found this
sucker (looked for ages, but it has to come to me, too lazy to mail order).
All you ever wanted to know about TG, Mark Pauline/SRL, Cab Vol, Non, Monte
Cazazza, Sordide Sentimentale, SPK, Z'ev, Johanna Went (? whoa, what's she
doing in this company?), and Rhythm &amp; Noise ... as they were, circa '83ish.
Good shit, this ...
- One Two Three Four, A Rock `n' Roll Quarterly (HAH!), Issue #2.  Supposed
to be a `quarterly', but this is only the 2nd ish ever in two years' time.
Put out by John Talley-Jones (&amp; wife Kathy) of Urinals/100 Flowers/Radwaste
&amp; Happy Squid records fame (along with Kevin Barrett and Brenda Johnson-Grau,
the other editors), this is a serious little book wherein the editors and
selected others pontificate on Rock and What It Means To Us today.  Sample
columns this time out:
	Review - the Editors
	Popular Culture, Popular Knowledge - Iain Chambers
	Sexism &amp; Racism &amp; Rock and Roll - Alix Dobkin
	Reward Systems in Popular Music - Arnold S. Wolfe
	Frankie says BUY ME - Simon Frith
	Prince and the Sound of Time Experienced - Kevin Barrett
there's also a `Reference Section' that includes a Buddy Holly compendium
(1st ish had a Chuck Berry compendium), a Syllabus, and a Call for Papers.

This is about the only rag I've ever seen that says "Let's sit down and
seriously discuss alternative (&amp; mainstream) rock music vs. Popular Culture
et al., and let's assume we can do this intelligently and that our readers
are also intelligent".  Damn good stuff, this is.  Can get overly pompous
at times (depends on the author of the moment) or scholarly, but this is the
type of read to keep !gtaylor awake 'till 4 AM to finish ... :-)
In case anyone's interested, you can try to order this through the Starkman
Concern, or try this address directly (I make no promises!):
	Editors
	Strong Sounding Thought Press, Inc.
	P.O. Box 691212
	Los Angeles, CA  90069  USA
Sez here "Unsolicited manuscripts welcome.  Please address all correspondence
to (above)" and "Send two copies of all manuscripts and include return
postage.  Query letters answered promptly, we promise" (Surrrre ... :-))

Replies Dept.:
&gt;Gun Club
addendum: Patricia Morrison was/is in Fur Bible and The Sisterhood ...

&gt;Andrea `Enthal &amp; Spin
Good for her, Spin was never worth the effort anyway.  Unfortunately, she's
still an opinionated twit, and her radio show's going downhill fast
(nowadays I can listen to it for 3 hours and count the good shit on 2 hands).
She's got this obsession these days with obscure Australian and New Zealand
semi-garage pop bands.  They mostly go in one ear and out the other ...

&gt;From mimir.dmt.oz!rvh (Richard van Hoesel)
Was wondering when you'd resurface ...

&gt;Non `Blood and Flame'
Hmmm, think I just saw this today.  Sounds good ...

&gt;Coil `The Anal Staircase' 12"
&gt;	Someone mentioned the album a while back - still haven't heard it
I did - it's still not out yet (`Horse Rotorvator') as far as I can tell.
71% ?  Aw, be a nice guy, have a heart, give it a few more spins, you are
getting sleepy, you are getting sleeeepppyyy, it rates a 95 ... :-)

&gt;FACTRIX CAZZAZA [sic] / live "Babylon..." or something (around '83)
Actually it's Factrix, and Monte Cazazza, more like '81 ...

&gt;Shreikback : playing Melbourne 20 March at the Venue
Trivial tit-for-tat: you said `&gt;Severed Heads ... (yawn)', Tom Ellard says
`Melbourne ... Wankers!'.  End of Round 1, ding! ... :-)

&gt;Tesla
&gt;Can anyone tell me something about Tesla?  Their album "Mechanical Resonance"
&gt;appeared in the top 20 of the album chart in RS.
Hmmm, I have a friend who is a `go-fer' for a Rock Video production company;
they just did a Tesla video.  Are these the same people that are some mersh
metal band, originally from Sacramento, with some 28ish year old dude as
frontman, and the rest are some fresh faced teenagers (or barely post-teenage)?
That's how he described them ...

Well, 11:40, time to bail outta here.

KATSOUROS, I'LL DEAL WITH YOUR FUCKING CRAP LATER, DUDE.
