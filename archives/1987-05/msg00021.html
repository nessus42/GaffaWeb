Channing-Murray Foundation Benefit Concert, Champaign IL 3/1/87

Gawd, it's so frustrating sometimes... Channing-Murray is an incredibly
cool religious organization that lets people use their small church for
movies and (mostly hardcore) shows. So a bunch of local bands get
together to organize a benefit and less than a hundred people show up.
So where were you local music lovers/occasional lovehounders when they
needed you??? YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE! Geeeeez....

Well it was your loss. Four of the most interesting bands in the
Champaign/Urbana area played tonight. Forget the regular bar bands,
and the wimps you read about in Option etc. that are from the area.
The guys that played tonight are the future of what little local scene
we have, and they can only get better.

(Surreal opening to the evening: John, Brad, Fish and I met in this
small restaurant before the show, and the background music was
Psychic TV! YOW!)

Still Warm Stillborn, the invisible band of Chambana, opened. Very
dada-influenced performance-oriented, with very quiet sounds 
alternating with clanging metal that went over the heads of most
people there. Fun tribal audience-participation piece at the end.

Generic Error was a hardcore 4-piece with a female singer. The bad
mix contributed to the disappearance of the vocals. Some interesting
arrangements, superb guitarist. Not much thrashing, but everyone
was probably just happy sitting back and watching Chris' lead guitar
smoke during his vicious solos. Hmmmmmm....

Blood Brain Barrier, an experimental/noise/jazz-flavored/free improv
band moved an army of 7 or 8 noise mongers on stage. Their new guitarist
really adds another dimension with Belew-esque noise and wicked
little figurations. Two drummers, extra percussionist, funky bass,
occasional voice samples and synth support. Loud, brash and
fun to watch.

Tugrik Dhugugrik sounded a little tired, perhaps from their show
the night before. A post-punk 5-piece with a solid lineup, including
a vocalist who's entertaining but not obnoxious and a superb lead
guitarist (the same Chris from Generic Error). Their usual sophisticated
arrangements and zest, tho not quite up to their usual standards.

If only more people had showed up! Support your local scene etc...

Bill
