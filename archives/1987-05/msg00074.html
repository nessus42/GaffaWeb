Jonas Hellbourg is one of the best all-around bass players around today.  He
played on the Mahavishnu Orchestra's last 2 albums, but his best work is on
his solo albums.  I don't think they are available in the US (I bought mine
in Paris, but they are on sale in HMV in London)  but they are truly
fantastic.  On his second album, Elegent Punk, he played some of the best pop
bass I have heard.  I saw him do a masterclass in The Bass Centre (which is
the best bass shop anywhere - it is in opposite Wapping tube stop in London -
Has every possible bass you have seen, + many WALS and ALEMBICS - It is run
by people who are really helpful) with his new WAL doubleneck (top fretted,
bottom fretless) and my mouth was scraping on the ground as I walked out.  He
has mastered the art of harmonics, tapping, popping, and is so quick that his
fingers blur.  You may have seen him in a Guitar issue last year, and he
sponsors Rotosound strings, the only way to go.
