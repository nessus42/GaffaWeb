Actually, that should be "The same old album mix of 'Sat in Your Lap' on
'The Whole Story' rather than the different single mix."

As I mentioned at some point earlier, this "singles collection"
album is supposed to be a collection of the SINGLES original master
tapes of the single mixes. Although Kate claimed at one point that
none of the singles were mixed again for their single releases, this
is definitely not true (at her own admission) about the mix of
"Sat in your Lap" - the original single, which came out in the spring
of 1981, had drums that were virtually free of echo, which gave them
a really elastic, "thop-thop-y" sound. She was originally going to leave
the song entirely off "The Dreaming," but was convinced by friends 
(and her fans?) to put it on. So she re-mixed it, giving the drums
much more echo and moving the voice up in the mix. As a result, (I think) the
song on the album is totally different sounding than that on the single.
But the versi on "TWS" is the album version, which is sort of 
disapting, since my "SIYL" single warped like lasagna a couple
of years ago, and I was hoping for a clear version of it. Oh well.

Does anyone else notice this? Doug? Andrew?

Hugh
