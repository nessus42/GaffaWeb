&gt;&gt; As is evidenced by his rather immodest recitation of his academic
&gt;&gt; credentials, Mr. Marvick does have other things on his mind.

&gt; He knew it would seem immodest, but the posting which prompted it
&gt; (that he had never taken a course in art history) was just too
&gt; provocative.  A minor curse of Harvard graduates is that they cannot
&gt; mention their alma mater without seeming immodest. 9 out of 10
&gt; times, he must answer, "Oh, I went to school back east," and hope
&gt; people think of Boston College.

This is not a curse imparted only upon Harvard graduates. In fact,
anyone who attended a prestigious(??) school has probably felt, when
asked about their background, how do I tell him/her that I went to
_____ without making it sound like "I went to _____ and you went to
_____ (*supposedly* lesser school) and so I guess I'm just a little
bit superior (time for the superiority dance? :-) ). Of course, few
actually feel this way, but it's still easy to be self-conscious.  And
when you say "Oh, I went to school back east/up north/down under/etc."
you probably don't really want people to think of (fill in your
favorite proximate second rung school), but rather "I bet he went to
(first rate school), but doesn't want to flaunt it."

=====

To make this kosher, a musical note:

When in LA last weekend, I visited one of my favorite record stores:
Moby Disk in Canoga Park (also visited the Moby in Sherman Oaks, but
that one isn't relevant to this story...). Anyway, after waiting on
line for about 20 minutes (the cashier this day was really slow, and
for some reason the store was very busy) and paying for my stack of
finds, I quickly leafed through the used singles section. And what
should be there but a couple of singles from Kate Bush's "The Kick
Inside" (one was "Wuthering Heights", I don't recall now what the
other was). Not promo copies, but stock copies in mint condition with
picture sleaves.  $1.00 each. Unfortunately, I absolutely had to be
somewhere 5 minutes earlier, so I couldn't wait on line to buy them,
and they weren't there when I came back later. I mean, these singles
wouldn't have meant the world to me, let alone as much as, say, one of
the original Move US singles with picture sleave, but they would have
been nice to have.  C'est la vie.
