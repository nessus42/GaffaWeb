	What's going on in the L.A. world these days? This summer the
Adolescents came to Boston with Dr. Know - both bands ripped. What's with 
the Agnew bros. - are D.I. still around?  Their lp "Dog Bites, Horse
Cries" is a masterpiece of melodic thrash (popcore?).  Dr. Know were
KILLER - why don't I ever hear about them. I've seen them lumped into
the metal-core category - to me they sound like a cross between, maybe
Misfits and Motorhead. (Is it true that the lead guy was the kid who
played in "Courtship of Eddie's Father"? ) They have at least two
albums out. The early stuff is closer to the hardcore side of the fence.
	It seems like the east and west coasts aren't sewn too tightly 
together for this type of music. I have a brother who's part of the Eugene OR
scene, and tells me that bands there pretty much play in basements instead
of clubs. A lot of the kids who ended up there are runaways from LA, 
drug-crazed skate punks who draw on each other with home-made tattoo
guns.  Anyone from the west coast heard of E-13? They had some ugly
song called "yellow floaters", which is based in truth apparently, due to
excessive consumption.. part of a loose network of punks calling themselves 
Cheeseheads. I know that a few of them sold everything they owned and bought
one-way tickets to Maui this summer, but of the ones left, a couple of
'em are hopefully moving here this summer (my bro and some kid named
Animal - has LOBOTOMY tattooed on his head). We're forming a band, one
whose roots lay TWISTED somewhere in the valley of nightmares...(anyone
interested - write me).  This place could damn sure use something like
that.
