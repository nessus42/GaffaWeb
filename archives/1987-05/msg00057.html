Urge Overkill/Club Crack at Mabel's, 3/2/87

UO were making a video, so the show was free. Pretty small crowd, and they
were DEAD. Only three people danced. See if they make a video here again.
Urge Overkill gave an awesome show. The decent sound system really brought
out the band's characteristic sound: churning, oozing guitar noise, 
subterranean bass lines, overlapping vocals, snappy rhythms. Reminds me
of Mission of Burma and Swans. At the end the guitar player yelled: "Either
you sucked or we did." See these guys when they come into your area. 
(Warning: their ep does not capture the live sound very well, but is still
interesting.)

Club Crack played their best gig so far. The vocalist finally toned down
his Mick Jagger antics and things are starting to gel: tight drums and
scrap metal percussion combo, high thin guitar lines and whooshing synth
sounds. Crowd was dancing like mad, even people who don't usually dance
at shows. They have a tape out but it's inferior to the live sound. Chicago
people will get to see them soon, I think.

And it was all free. What's this about the best things in life etc...

Coming up in the next two months: Scratch Acid, Big Black (again!), Urge
Overkill, Birdsongs of the Mesozoic (when's Roger Miller's 12" coming
out???), Tom Cora, fIREHOSE. Is this a happenin' town or what?

Bill
