Letter received from Andrea 'Enthal

******************************************************************************8
Dear Friends:

The January 1987 issue (of Spin) will contain my 21st and last4 edition of the 
column,  Underground.

Spin intends to continue running a column with that name in their magazine.

At best I can determine (since Bog Guxxione Jr never saw fit to speak to me)
I was fired for demanding paychecks they owed me.  If that is true, I am
proud.

Spin has been ripping off writers and photographers for two years now.  I was
paid well and relatively promptly compared to many of my collegues.  It is
for those collegues and the people on the inside of Spin who tried to help them
I feel bad.  George DuBose (the photo editor) was fired at the same time as
I for advising photographers who could not collect their money from Spin, to
take BG JR to small claims court.  As the assigning editor, Dubose could not
get his people paid.  There's something wrong with an organization when that's
true.  uit is not as if Spin didn't have the money.  That would be forgivable
but Bob Jr. gets 170,000$ a month from his Dad, every month, to run Spin.
(That's about 2 1/2 million a year) On top of that, his office space, 
electricity, phone bills and postage are free via his Dad.

Still he doesn't pay freelancers @25, @50, and $75 sums he owes.

I leave you, my readres, with regret.  My column was for you, no Spin 
magazine.  If I convinced somebody that there was something going on 
beyond AOR and MTV fodder, then my two years as Spin were successful.
There's music out there for you to find on your own.
I will continue to research music and present my findings in print, on my
Los ANGELOS radio program, and on the nation syndicated program Radio
Underground.  I will continue to be at PO Box 4904, Panorama City, CA 91412.

	Andrea 'Enthal
