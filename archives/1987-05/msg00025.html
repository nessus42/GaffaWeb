KT news:
Yet another bunch of Kate Bush posters have come on the
L.A. market. There are three, all monochrome, all rather
small as posters go, all apparently imports, probably
unofficial, but printed well on good, heavy poster paper.
The first is a simple copy of the The Whole Story cover photo.
The second is a copy of the UK promotional poster used
to advertise the "RUTH" single (large photo of Kate in
arms of male dance-partner Michel Hervieu, with small
inset of single cover). The third is a blow-up of the
photo of Kate standing, wearing dance leotards and a sash
around the waist. This photo originally appeared in the
UK sheet-music book of Lionheart, and in the poster's upper
left-hand corner Kate's name has been printed in lavender-ish script.

The Whole Story slipped another few notches in the March 7 (?)
issue of Billboard, to number 92 (?), after fourteen weeks in
the charts. Not bad for an album of (mostly) re-releases.

The twelfth issue of Australian KT fanzine "Dreamtime" arrived
in IED's post today. At first a little disorienting to read about a
"hot summer" in a "February -- April" issue, but now understood.

Gaye Godfrey, who is the main force behind "Dreamtime", has written a
detailed account of her first-ever trip to England in search of
things Kate. It is a fascinating story, illustrated with photos
of Gaye at the Bush family's East Wickham Farm in the company of
Kate's mother Hannah (is there any other superstar in Europe
more accommodating to her fans than Kate and her family? Their
poor Farm -- it's beginning to get overrun with pilgrims in
search of Mecca). Gaye gives a rundown of all the different
kinds of KT merchandise she was able to find in the UK, and
describes her meeting with Kate and with Dave Cross and Krys
and Peter Fitzgerald-Morris (of "Homeground"). Among other things
the latest issue of "Dreamtime" describes a poster in green and
pink taken from the photo of Kate on the cover of Vermorel's second
"biography". Such a poster has never been available in
the US, to IED's knowledge. Overall, Gaye's article is especially
easy for American fans to sympathize with, since the amount
of exposure of Kate in Australia is about as miserable as in
America, and Gaye's air of innocent wonder and flurry of mad consumption
of anything to do with Kate while in England will be immediately
familiar to non-UK fanaTiKs.
There is a re-print of a very recent (but brief)
interview which Kate gave to the "Courier Mail" of Brisbane, Aust.;
a very negative review of Kate's re-recording of
"Wuthering Heights"; and a false announcement that the
soundtrack to "Brazil" (which features a cover of the title
song by Kate) had "recently been released". (MCA -- the bastards --
now say that they have no plans to release a soundtrack of the film.)
A nearly perfect translation of "Ne t'Enfuis Pas" is included;
and in a review of the "The Whole Story" video there is a
description of the "new" video for "Wow": apparently it consists
of clips from the Hammersmith performance, edited precisely so
as to synch perfectly with the studio vocal track. Although
again there is no detailed description of the "X4" video, from
the little that Gaye does describe it seems more likely than ever
that the film aired by MTV was a butchered, edited version.
For female KT fans who may be curious, Gaye has discovered
where one may purchase a pair of Kate's dragon earrings (featured
on the cover of the UK "Hounds of Love" single). If anyone is
interested in details, contact IED.

Finally, IED announces the imminent appearance in Love-Hounds
of the (by-now) famous Capital Radio interview, undertaken by
Tony Myatt in November of 1985 and played to fans at the
Romford KT Convention the same month. The text is long and
will appear in installments, without -- happy day! -- any comment
from your friendly transcriber.

Now, for the mailbag.
To Hugh:
Both of yesterday's postings much appreciated this end; you're
very convincing about the tendency to prefer all things imported
over domestic product.
In response to your question, IED's UK import CD of
Never For Ever has no such problem at the beginning of
"Babooshka". Maybe yours is just a faulty pressing or
it needs a cleaning, or maybe it's the D-5 (my first
CD player, too), which seems to get more confused by CD flaws
than some newer models. Anyway, IED's copy of the CD starts
on cue at 0:00.
Question: You (or someone) has mentioned once before an interview
with Kate in which she discusses her attitude towards
digital recording techniques and "digital editing". Since
you've mentioned it again, could you identify where
this interview was published? Thanks very much.
