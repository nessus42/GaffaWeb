&gt;From: squids%UMASS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu
&gt;          (The UMass Squids Association)
&gt;
&gt;Let me take this opportunity to second Ranjit's nomination
&gt;of "SKYLARKING" by XTC... This is definitely one of the top two
&gt;albums of last year... (Don't ask me what number one is, I haven't
&gt;the faintest idea)
&gt; 
Well, at least SOMEONE doesn't feel pity and contempt.  Now, let me
second the motion that this newsgroup be renamed "mod.music.ied."
Not because of any glut of Marvicisms, but because I see most of
mod.music.gaffa quoted in his messages long before I receive the
originals.  Perhaps this is why:

]To: zen!ucbcad!ames!styx!twg-ap!amdahl!pyramid!prls!philabs!cmcl2!beta!unm-la!unmvax!hi!jedi!sundc!seismo!nbires!hao!hplabs!decwrl!decvax!wanginst!ulowell!ci-dandelion!necntc!husc6!panda!genrad!mit-eddie!EDDIE.MIT.EDU!Love-Hounds-request

I might as well say why I like "Skylarking," as that seems to be the
thing to do these days.  First, continuity of music.  This is obvious
just from listening.  Example: the join between "Summer's Cauldron" and
"Grass," or between "Ballet for a Rainy Day" and "1000 Umbrellas."  
Second, continuity of theme.  "Ballet" and "Umbrellas," "Grass" and "The
Meeting Place," "Earn Enough for Us" and "Big Day."  Third: beautiful
lyrics.  They may not be profound, they may not be screeched, but "Insect
bomber Buddhist droning/Copper chord of August's organ" is pretty neat,
and "Who's pushing the pedals on the Season Cycle" is clever.  Fourth,
good production.  I don't have the vocabulary to rave about production.
Fifth: variety of music.  Sixth: variety of theme and mood.  Seventh:
doesn't take itself too seriously (contrast with "Experiment
IV/Even trIpe mix").   Since seven is a lucky number, I'll stop here.

I earlier nominated Talking Heads' "Remain in Light" for an Andy (the
award for Sophistication, Originality, and Complexity."  I would like to
stress this, because I have discovered that this is the only album
I can listen to three times through on headphones and hear something
different and new each time.  (Bush I couldn't listen to three times
through, period.  I have to wait at least a day to recover from any
particular album.  I offer no value judgements regarding this point.)

On the sale table at Waldenbooks, an interesting tome.  "The Ultimate 
Collection," or something like that, detailing the 200 records you should
buy to get a good overview of rock.  Didn't buy it, but I flipped through
the section on the 80's.  Caught my eye: The Soft Boys, Television.

[Re Experiment IV, which, by the way, anagrams to Ever Inept Mix:]
&gt;(From squids again)
&gt;the 12" version is slightly superior to it.  Well, I finally
&gt;got hold of a copy and have listened to it extensively.  I think
&gt;the violin solo is VASTLY OVERRATED.  Sure, it's *good* and it's
	...
&gt;and Jig Of Life" -- it STILL seems like a mediocre Top 40 song!
&gt;(to me anyway, if you get off on it, more power to yoa)
&gt; 
I agree for the most part.  Now, several of you have kindly explained
to me that this was only a good single, not part of a great album.
But then, what was all the fuss about?  When E4 first appeared, it
was "the greatest thing in the universe."  I will say it's got
Complexity, but I'm not so sure about Sophistication or Originality.
I'll take "Jig of Life" for that.

I picked up "Gotta Let this Hen Out" by Hitchcock.  It's good but not
great.  Any suggestions regarding my next Hitchcock purchase?

Ditto for "Echoes in a Shallow Bay," Cocteau Twins.

Ditto for "Hammer Party," Big Black, except that this IS great.

IED: I apologize for misspelling "libretto"  (I assure you it was a
typo, as the above spelling is the way I _believe_ it should be spelled,
and the dictionary, thankfully, agrees) and for tricking you into
flaming someone else for it.  I may be a pitiful, contemptible typist,
but I know my nouns.

I will refrain from saying anything nasty about IED, although he
deserves it for not practicing what he preaches in his postings,
because everyone else is doing it.  However, I will say that I have
anagrams that definitively prove that IED is a devil-worshipping
soviet spy from Middle Earth who is mean to flying insects and busboys.

...enough...
