   Boy, oh boy, oh boy.  I step out of the group for a few weeks and all
hell breaks loose.  You can all simmer down now, I'm back. ( :-) )

   Before having to sweep my office contents into a few boxes, I read a
couple of things that I wanted to answer.  Unfortunately, it was "pack now
or forever regret leaving 3/4 of your stuff in Indy", so I packed.  Sorry
I can't quote any of these articles ... they don't have any of "that netnews
shit" here at Merrimack Valley.  I've gone to great troubles to get a few of
my favorite groups forwarded to me here.  My sincerest thanks to our group's
moderator, Doug Alan, for putting me in the daily digest mailing list for
mod.music.gaffa.

   At any rate ... hey IED!  When you issued your challenge I distinctly
remember it as going: "name an album that ...".  I _named_ three albums
that I personally felt were at least "comparable" to TD and HoL in the
various categories outlined in your challenge.  I didn't discuss any of
these categories because (a) that was not part of the challenge and (b) I
really didn't have the time.  At this point in time, I feel that it would
be really counterproductive to add any more fuel to this debate (besides,
I feel like I'm part of a song: "Life During the Interim", you know? ...
"I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no records, ain't got no CDs to play"
and probably won't until June).  A second thing I wanted to say was that
I would like to apologize to the group if my answers to the Kate trivia
questions I had posted a long, long time ago were a duplicate.  The Indy
computers were having problems with netnews for a while there and I never
saw Doug's public answers to the questions I made.  I had received mail
from Doug, but I thought this was just a private message and that the
answers had not been posted publicly.  Anyway, it probably didn't hurt
anyone to see the answers twice (though I must admit that with all the time
between questions and answers it probably would have been a good idea to
reprint the questions).

   As far as all the wild debate going on currently ... this little verse
keeps going through my mind as I read on: "I'm stretching my mouth to let
those big words come right out".  Hey folks ... why don't we get on to
something constructive like (since I've been out of touch for a while):
Can anybody tell me what the status of "The Whole Story" video is?  Will
it be released in the US or not?  Is there anyone I can bother to prod
them (EMI?) towards releasing it here?

					Nice to be back, I think
