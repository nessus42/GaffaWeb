I've put together a few reviews of good 80's garage-psych.  I'm not as
fanatical about garage grunge psych as some folks are.  I usually go for more
"trippy" or progressive psychedelic rock; so this list represents the best
grunge of what I've heard to date.

These are arranged most-essential to least essential.  If you are unfamiliar
with this kind of music and want to try something fun and different, that's
exactly what you'll get.  Check 'em out.  (Recent releases are indicated.)
--John


The Fuzztones, "Lysergic Emmenations"
  Absolutely essential psych, get it NOW!!!  Wild vocals, fine songs, fuzzed-
  out guitar, funny packaging.  Very gothic/horror edged psych, a distinctive
  subgenre of psych that doesn't seem to be done much (see also the
  Blacklight Cameleons).  Lysergic Emmenations is really more than garage
  psych, but I plug it every chance I get.

Hidden Peace, "We All Have..."  [recent release]
  Great garage psych from Greece.  Very 60's punk style vocals (nasal,
  whiney) with some great guitar work and authentic 60's tunes dashed with
  funny twists.
  On Hitch-Hyke Records.  In USA try contacting Lori Spilka C/o Music Rage
  Management, POBox 3178, North Hollywood CA 91609.  Otherwise ask me for 
  their address in Greece!

The Olympic Sideburns, self titled LP (with extra EP for a little bit more).
  [recent release]
  Some great guitar and strong, snarling/screaming vocals (yeah, they all do
  that but I think this guy stands out as snarlers go).  Their music borrows
  heavily on 60's sounds, but with diversity and strong playing.  Last cut is
  absolutely killer.
  --on New Rose (Paris, though recorded in Australia)

Magic Carpets, "Guided naffi Missle"
  Bizarre, interesting, controlled/laid back garage psych, slightly mind-
  damaged sounding.  Singer has a meak style somewhat reminiscent of Syd
  Barrett.  This album is good stuff, definitely distinctive garage psych.
  -on Probe Plus, Liverpool.

A Real Cool Time, "Distorted Sounds from the North" (compilation LP)
  [recent release]
  "Powerful Swedish garage rock compilation with great raw, rootsy rock 'n' 
   roll with snarling psychedelic, blues, rockabilly overtones and some 
   excellent guitar. -recommended-"  --The Quaker

  I agree with the above review.  The Nomads open up with an unmerciful guitar
  onslaught.  Problem is also featured on the comp as very influential 
  (starting 1977) on the current Swedish garage resurgence.  There's also some
  strong rockabilly on this LP that has changed my mind somewhat about that
  style of rock.
  --on Amigo  
  
Lyres, "On Fyre"
  Well produced, good garage psych.  But for my money, The Fuzztones cover 
  similar ground (though with a more gothic horror feel) with more 
  interesting songs, and maybe more energy.
