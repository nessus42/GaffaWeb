First off, I admit it.  I listen to some music they play on commercial
radio.  I'm sorry.  If you look down at all popular music, then skip
to the P.S. below.

Anyway, my roommate just got a CD of ``daft'' which is a compilation
of stuff Art of Noise did while they were still with ZTT.  I knew that
the band members were upset at the image that Trevor Horn was creating
for them (which is to say, none at all), but I didn't know *Trevor*
and crew were this upset!  The stuff in the little pamphlet that comes
with CD's (what the hell do you call those?)  says:

     "Two years ago Trevor Horn and Paul Morley began an 8 year work
      to be entitled The Raiding Of The 20th Century, which was to
      be an immodest, insightful assembly of musical drama, orna-
      mental documentary and cultural commentary -- the *commodity*
      as commentator....[more such stuff]...Art Of Noise were the
      unit of communication that organised affairs, and were orga-
      nized *by* affairs....Members of Art Of Noise who aided on the
      musical side of Horn and Morley's swindling, meditating
      project have now decided that they are competent enough to
      persue a conventional rock career, ...Members Jeczalik,
      Dudley and Langan...have retained the name Art Of Noise as the
      commercial success associated with it suits their brazen
      career-besotted attitude...."

Jeez.  

All I have to say is:

      The world is rough.  Man does not realise the true 
      nature of Evil, much less the true nature of Truth.  
      The Z.T.T. Year Art Of Noise were seperated... The 
      Z.T.T. Year Art Of Noise suddenly...snapped.
      As Horn and Morley stood, the happy, fed take away 
      Art Of Noise moved
      or/walked!
      And in their contempt Z.T.T. realised the shortest
      path between one point is a circle.
      "You! hypocrite lecteur! -- mon semblable, -- mon frere!"

P.S. I saw some Residents picture discs... Are they new?  Have I just
     not seen them before?  In either case, what's on 'em?  Also, has
     anybody bought the Psychic TV CD?  I've been looking at it for
     months now, but something else always wins out.  By the way, I
     think Flipper's _Gone Fishin'_ is pompous, or at least as pompous
     and arty as punk gets.  I should probably try their earlier
     stuff, though.
