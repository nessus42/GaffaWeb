<PRE>
&gt;Thanks first of all to Sue for pointing out that
&gt;a long posting of extracts from earlier IED postings,
&gt;pasted together to form meaningless non sequiturs
&gt;(other than those originally committed by IED himself)
&gt;was not actually posted by IED at all, but by a
&gt;cowardly imposter. IED was saddened to read Sue's
&gt;final comment, however.
 
It is the sheer *volume* of IED's postings that has, more than
anything else, left me staggering away from my terminal.  When
I make printouts of the digests, his domination of this forum
is even more obvious, as they run for pages and pages.  I am
confident, however, that IED's new resolution to only answer
some of the mail from his detraKTors will do its bit to restore
order and civility to love-hounds.  IED may be confident that I
greatly enjoy his tidbits of KTNews, and the interviews that he
typed in were also fascinating.  I may only remind him that
"less *is* more."
 
&gt;Still this pathetic hangup with the way IED identifies himself,
&gt;as though that had anything at all to do with the substance of
&gt;his arguments. You have a lot of catching up to do.
 
As a fan of Miss Manners, I certainly don't have this hangup
(not that IED implied that I did).  I simply see Miss Manners
as the "etiquette-obsessed" part of Judith Martin's persona, and
IED as the "Kate-obsessed" part of Andrew Marvick's persona.  As
is evidenced by his rather immodest recitation of his academic
credentials, Mr. Marvick does have other things on his mind.
