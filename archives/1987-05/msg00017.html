Re Steenburgen: |&gt;oug, how do you KNOW it isn't Kate seeing MacDowell
on the sly? She managed to keep Del a secret for a long time...

&gt;From: Sue Trowbridge  &lt;ins_aset%JHUNIX.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu&gt;
&gt;Subject:   Re: IED
&gt;It is the sheer *volume* of IED's postings that has, more than
&gt;anything else, left me staggering away from my terminal.

You think you've got it bad, just imagine how HE feels after typing
all that crap up. Of course you're right: he doesn't have to read it.

&gt;When I make printouts of the digests, his domination of this forum
&gt;is even more obvious, as they run for pages and pages.

He's trying to do something about that. (To be fair, though, a large part
of his old postings consist of reprints of other L-Hs' earlier comments.)

&gt;I am confident, however, that IED's new resolution to only answer
&gt;some of the mail from his detraKTors will do its bit to restore
&gt;order and civility to love-hounds.

He's not confident but hopeful. OK if he answers the nice mail, too --
like yours -- once in a while, though?

&gt;IED may be confident that I
&gt;greatly enjoy his tidbits of KTNews, and the interviews that he
&gt;typed in were also fascinating.  I may only remind him that
&gt;"less *is* more."

About IED, you're probably right; but the maxim itself is suspect. Keith
Jarrett has said in criticism of the (recent) Minimalist movement in
music: "The truth, of course, is that 'Less is less'.

&gt; &lt;I see&gt; IED as the "Kate-obsessed" part of Andrew Marvick's persona.

That's exaKTly right. Thank you, Sue!

&gt;As is evidenced by his rather immodest recitation of his academic
&gt;credentials, Mr. Marvick does have other things on his mind.

He knew it would seem immodest, but the posting which prompted it (that
he had never taken a course in art history) was just too provocative.
A minor curse of Harvard graduates is that they cannot mention their alma
mater without seeming immodest. 9 out of 10 times, he must answer, "Oh, I
went to school back east," and hope people think of Boston College.

&gt;&gt;&gt;... this isn't saying much, since there were NO very good LPs made in 1986.

&gt;I could not agree less.

Neil said he agreed with IED on this? Thanks, Neil, join a club of one.

That's all -- twenty slim little lines. Enjoy the dIEDt.
