: His latest `industrial' sound collage perpetuating the sound of music
: in ambience and screaming beat. Its macabre texture combined with
: its dark emotive sincerity will tear you limb from limb,
: leaving you numbed from the inside out...

********************************************************************

If you're into * S O U N D * at all; 
Even if you only buy ONE albumn this year... THIS is the one...
So if at the end of the year you're complaining about the year's
releases again... and you haven't bought this.. well/- your loss.

	More good *zound* recently aquired

NON / "Physical Evidence" (around '84/85?)
________________________

	According to many a NON fanatic / his worst albumn:
	But only because of the recording quality. As far as I'm
	concerned, this doesn't upset the albumn terribly. In fact
	on some tracks, the resonant sound enhances many of the 
	mechanical gratings on the albumn. More rythmic than e.g.
	"Blood and Flame" and more raw - which for this albumn I
	consider a +.

COIL / "The anal staircase" / 12" ('86)
________________________________

	Someone mentioned the albumn a while back /- still
	haven't heard it, but bought the 12" a while back.
	The title track :   71% : very `beat' for coil, not quite as vicious
				  as it could have been. Still. Not bad.
	First track side 2: 56% : drags on a little.
	2nd track side 2:   94% : called "RAVENOUS";
				  fantastic piece of slow looming keyboard
				  sounds with some good `eary' sound effects.

FUNKADELIC / "Uncle Jam wants You" ('7?)
__________________________________

	Yow! FUNk at its FUNst. These guys have some of the best parties
	I've heard on vinyl yet. Only second to PARLIMENT (simlar line-
	up to FUNKADELIC/ basically the same band I think) parties.


FACTRIX CAZZAZA / live "Babylon..." or something (around '83)
________________________________________________

	Forgotten just now what this was called exactly. Ze'v on
	"found percussion". Tapes. Effects. Good live hollow bass sound.
	Ambient pere ubu feel on some tracks.
	This was an incredible find at $1,- !!! (second hand / great condition).
	The guy in the shop said he didn't realize that was in there..
	His loss / My gain.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Other guf;

	- Someone waaz pushing the HOLGER HILLER albumn "Oben Im Eck"
	I heard the first track on this albumn of re-arranged sampled
	sounds at my local fascist import store / Sounded great
	- some very powerfull classical (almost Laibach!) sounds...
	so I bought it. When I got it home, however /- yik!
	About every second song on the albumn is art-fag "I've got a
	sampler" and I'm gonna play wimpy, self indulgent, shallow
	yuppie shit with it!
	I just couldn't believe how this guy could put such incredibly
	BAD tracks in between some really good tracks.
	I liked about 2-3 tracks a hell of a lot, thought about 2 were 
	o.k. and hated the others. Annoying.

	- D.A.F. ( someone asked a long while ago )
	A lot of their stuff starts to sound alike after a while.
	Punchy synth/sequencer tracks with `real' drums and a deep
	sharp vocal.(2 piece).  Their albumn "Gold und Liebe" is by 
	far my favourite..  One DAF 12" also worth getting,
	is "der Mussolini", which isn't on the said albumn.
	I think these guys were probably doing better things with
	the three piece experimental band; "DER PLAN" though.
	Some very new ways of using synthesizers back in the late 70's
	and early 80's. Some great lyrics too (german though..).
	Their live performances probably outsurrealized even the 
	Residents.

	-Local scene:
	T.I.S.M. have released a mini albumn which is NOT AT ALL
	representative of their excellent live satirical pop performances.
	Unless you want to hear nagging rock'n'roll complete with
	lead guitar breaks a la 3xy (local mainstream brainwash station) 
	formula, forget it.

	Shriekback : playing Melbourne 20 March at The Venue. ($14,- BASS)
		   : playing Adelaide ?April.
		   : playing Sydney ?
		   .
		   .
		   .
		   .
		   ...........THIS IS WHAT YOU GET.


ps. I bet mommy's gonna shuv that little toy straight down your ****in' throat.

.....Baby you're a ghost town / And I just can't stand the stench.
