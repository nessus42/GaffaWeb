I recently read that Ms. Smith attended the tenth anniverary of Arista
Records, where she remarked to Clive Davis (the president of the company
and the person responsible for signing her to the label in 1975) that she
was interested in returning to the studio.
 
Incidently, Patti is married to Fred "Sonic" Smith who was one of the 
founding members of the MC5 (i.e., the Motor City 5). The MC5 and bands
such as Iggy and the Stooges were the precursors of punk music and they
enjoyed an avid following in the Midwest during the late 1960s and
early 1970s.
 
In March of 1976, Patti Smith played in Detroit and The Sonic Rendezvous
Band opened the show; of course, the leader of this band was Fred "Sonic"
Smith and it was then that the two met. Years later they were married
and in the early 1980s the couple had a child. At present, I believe
the Smith family resides in St. Claire Shores, Michigan, a quiet suburb
northeast of Detroit.
 
The last public performance of Patti Smith was apparently in Grosse
Pointe Farms, Michigan in the Spring of 1981. The performance featured
Patti playing a clarinet concerto in a benefit for the Detroit Symphony.

A short time after that at a Sonic Rendezvous performance, a friend
of mine spoke with Patti and asked: "Patti, what is the future of the
Patti Smith Group?" Patti responded, " Very Futuristic. "
 
      ... well, that conclude this clip on Patti Smith.
