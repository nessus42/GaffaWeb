This was taken from another mailing list, similar to Love-Hounds, but 
definitely on the edge.....

	----------------------------------------------------------
	Ultracore -  (n.) (UL-tra-kor), electronic folk music
		     form characterized by a harsh, hypersonic
 stolen from                but melodious sound, practiced by a small
 a rag called               cult of ethical poet/fanatics call "Husker Du",
 The Bob                    indigenous to the Minneapolis area.
	----------------------------------------------------------

	So anyway, Flip Your Wig is out ..... and it's hot.
	
	A "Spot"-less production... Bob and Grant did the production
	chores on this one, with sorta mixed results.  I've never been
	a big "BobandGrant-as-producers" fan (listen to Otto's or Soul Asylum),
	and while I can't really say I like Spots production either I do
	like the wall of guitar sound on Zen Arcade and New Day Rising.
	
	First reaction: VOCALS... they're louder than the guitar!
	This sorta threw me at first ... I mean Bob Mould is god right?
	So why cover him up with vocals.  But after listening a coupla
	times I realized that the guitar was still there, just that
	the vocals have been turned up (still no bass though).

	Anyway - quick rundown of some of da toons:
	
	Hate Paper Doll - We have winner... Hot stuff... wonderful
			  harmonies...  great hook.  It's got a
			  good beat, you can dance to it. I give it
			  a 96. (Laurence says it sounds like the
			  	    HR Puffenstuff theme)
	
	Green Eyes - Grant at his best - simple pop melody with
		     GREAT guitar sound over the chorus.. early
		     fave for best song on the album.
	
	Divide and Conquer - At first I really didn't like this one,
			     the vocal line sounded really forced
			     and there are no changes until the very
			     end of the song .. BUT - after listening
			     for some reason I beggining to like it - 
			     the lyrics are still sorta stupid though.
	
	Find Me - Acid induced hardcore ... wow! 
	
	The Baby Song - ???? if someone figures out why this is on the
			album .. tell me.  Does make for a nice follow 
			though.
	
	Flexible Flyer - more Grant - wonderful melody.

	OTHER TUNES:  Flip Your Wig - nice guitar sound
		      Every Everything - more Grant ala Turn Up the News
		      Makes No Sense at All - da single.  
		      Games - Bob about being a success

	All in all - a good to great album at about the level of
	New Day Rising (although nothing of the caliber of
	Celebrated Summer) but not as good as Zen Arcade.

	Oh - if anyone wants info on Mpls bands etc drop me a note - 
	     I'll see what I can do...
