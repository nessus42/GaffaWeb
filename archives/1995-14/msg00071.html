Hi Folks!

I wanted to tell you all about a _HOT_ RUTH cover!

I am surprised I have not seen it mentioned here.

(And yes, StevO, I checked the FAQ, that _you_
sent me, and didn't see it there either! *smile* Then again, maybe I missed it!)
(Too, I started reading Gaffa when this song came out, so maybe I missed posts
about it! If so, mea culpa!)


The group's name is Elastic Band and this song is incredibly danceable!!!!

I first heard it one year ago while I
was at a dance club in Philadelphia. I had mentioned to the dj that I love to
dance and then mentioned my favorite artist(Guess who?). He smiled and said,
"If you like to dance and Like Kate Bush, go back out to the dance floor!"  I
did so. When it started I couldn't believe it...my head started swimming (I just
put it on in the background right now...and so spins my head)!  Then I started
flying around the dance floor...swoon!  I couldn't stop moving and smiling!

(I just turned it up..so now my neighbors are grooving, too! lol)

When the song was over I went running to the dj's booth and he showed me
the album.  I told him I was from Boston and he said I should have no
trouble finding it at a dj store.  It is an import (at least for me!).

If you like dancing to bouncy music, you gonna enjoy this.
I played it for another Love Hound and she loved it!
 (.look Kate T.  this means you! *wink*)

So here's the info:  for the cd single (which is all I have)
three songs
1. RUTH (radio mix) 3:46 (K. Bush Music, Inc. (BMI))
2. RUTH (Alex party version) 5:56 (K. Bush Music, Inc. (BMI))
3. Rolling Down That Mountain (Momentum Mix) 4:50 (Hooker/Visnadi, Blue Flower)
(3 is obviously something else they put together and it's pretty cool!)

O.K., here are all the numbers from the disc:
ZYX Music (ZYX Music GMBH) Made in Germany (this is who markets it)
ZYX 7233-8 (I believe this is for the cd)
ZYX 7233-12 (for the 12 inch, I think)
 
Other numbers: LC 6350 (GEMA, Biem Countries)
bar code: 90204 20022

I tried Tower records and Strawberries around Boston and they did not have it.
I went to Boston Beat on Boylston Street (diagonal from Tower records for you
Bostonians), which is a dj oriented store. WHen I asked if they had it the
fellow at the counter said, "Are you kidding, it's the hottest dance tune in
Boston right now!"  Because it was an import it was rather expensive for a cd
single...I didn't care. 
 
Check it out!

(BTW, got my copy of the LH tapes! Outstanding!)
