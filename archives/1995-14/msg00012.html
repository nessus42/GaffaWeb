Archive-name: music/kate-bush-faq-diffs
Last-modified: 1995/04/23
Version: 1.3.a minus 1.2.p

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action.  The full version is posted to
rec.music.gaffa only.  You can get a full copy of the FAQ by requesting it from
me (uli@zoodle.robin.de).  If you subscribe to the list (done by sending
email to love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net) Bill Wisner will also provide you
with the full FAQ.  If you can't receive more than 64KB in one piece I can
split the FAQ for you.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.  Cosmetical changes aren't listed.

-------------------8&lt;-------------------
[removed the following paragraph:]

The only person whom I grant the right to interfere with the above paragraph
is Ron Hill as the author of a lot of this.  Ron, are you around?  I want to
remove this line.

[since Ron Hill (hi again!) is back and approved the freeware-concept of the FAQ]

2.4. MUSHrooms influenced by Kate

     (MUSH is Multi-User Shared Hallucination.)  There's a heavily
     Kate-influenced MUSHroom.  To access it, you need a direct internet
     connection and telnet.  Type:

        telnet caisr2.caisr.cwru.edu 4201

     And once you're logged on, type

        @tel #68340

     at the prompt.

     Once you're inside, you're in a Happy Rhodes-inspired room, but to
     get to the Kate room, just type "Kate" (although you may want to look
     around first and also type HELP just so you can figure out what's
     happening).

     Along with a Virtual Kate Paradise (which Steve humbly called "Stev0's
     GaffaWorld), you can have real-time chat with your fellow Lovehounds! [SB]

[Steve provided this which I put here as a new section, I can't try this out
yet, but hope to be able to do so before the next FAQ posting. ISDN is already
here.]

4.2. Tours

     There's a video tape ("Live at Hammersmith Odeon") and a 4 track EP from
     the tour.  The video unfortunately only contains half of the show.  The
     recordings of the rest had some technical problems and the result wasn't
     up to par with Kate's standards.  The video (now available in PAL and
     NTSC) is also available in a video+CD double pack, so Kate finally has
     an official live album.  The only other source are vinyl bootlegs
     which all are of a very bad sound quality, since they were done from the
     audience with late 70's equipment.  There are plenty of CD pirates from
     the video tape.  Since there is now an official CD of this, please
     consider buying it, especially if you do own one of the bootleg copies.

[forgot to change this when the NTSC version of the VHS+CD double pack was
sighted first]

4.4. Basic Discography/Videography

     The following is not intended to be a complete discography.  Something
     that qualifies better for that title will be available separately soon.
     See also the section 4.5. (Chart success), all singles are listed there.

[Added the last of these lines, which I already found out to be wrong (argh),
for I added another new section between 4.4 and the new 4.5, so 4.5 should
be 4.6 here. Sorry!]

     There are also quite a lot of cover versions, most of them of Wuthering
     Heights, The Man With The Child In His Eyes or Running Up That Hill.
     See section 'Other artists using Kate's work'

[Seems like I didn't forget it this time, no section number. This one is
meant to be 4.5. indeed. At least for now.]

4.5. Other Artists using Kate's Work

     This section compiles a list of all (known) cover versions of Kate's
     songs, as well as a list of all (known) cases where Kate's music was
     sampled for use in another song.  There are some question marks in there,
     which is when I didn't know more details.  If you know the answer, don't
     hesitate!

     Don't Give Up is also listed, despite the fact that it is not really a
     Kate Bush song.  In some cases, there's no known recording of a live
     performance.  Nevertheless these cases are listed as far as they are
     known.

[this is a completely new section. I remember Marcel told me once that Tori Amos
performed a cover version of a Kate song in one of her concerts, but I didn't
find the email and I couldn't remember which one it was. Any hint, Marcel?]

4.6. Chart success

     This section is a basic listing of chart position of Kate's singles,
     albums and videos.  Listing all chart positions from all charts from
     all countries with all dates would need much too much space for the FAQ,
     but such a list is in fact available.  Send me &lt;uli@zoodle.robin.de&gt; a
     mail and you'll get the latest copy.

     Each item is only listed with the highest chart entry for each country.
     Some countries have official or semi-official charts.  For these countries
     there might be two entries, if a specialised, non-local &amp; non-radio-
     station chart shows a higher position.  Sometimes the chart publisher
     isn't known.  Some entries might even be wrong.

     The (semi-)official charts are:

     UK: BMRB/Gallup
     USA: Billboard Hot 100 (singles) / Top 200 (albums)

[Credit where credit is due. And I think I really had too much time lately.
Unfortunately this was usually at weekends or late at night, so I couldn't
go CD shopping...]

4.9. Electronic books

     "The Garden"

        A Hypertext version of The Garden is also available:

           <A  HREF="http://remus.rutgers.edu/~woj/garden/">http://remus.rutgers.edu/~woj/garden/</A>

[added woj's htmlified version, also changed some of the URLs (not shown) to
conform to URL standards ('/' at the end of directories)]

4.11.Kate Bush World Wide Web (WWW) pages

     The Garden
        <A  HREF="http://remus.rutgers.edu/~woj/garden/">http://remus.rutgers.edu/~woj/garden/</A>

        This is Andy Marvick's The Garden, re-formatted to HTML by woj.

[another entry for the same thing...]

5.9. Miscellaneous

     Fruitopia Commercials
        Kate did the music for nine commericials only seen on American TV
        for Fruitopia, a line of fruit drinks produced by Minute Maid (which
        is a subsidiary of the Coca-Cola company).  There was also a longer
        advertisement seen in movie theatres which Kate also did the music
        for.  Another series of Fruitopia Commercials just started, the
        first one being spotted during a commercial break of the '95 Academy
        Awards show.

[anyone willing to send me a tape (audio is enough) of the new one? ;-) ]

7.   Credits

     The history of this FAQ starts with Jorn Barger writing a first FAQ for
     rec.music.gaffa/Love-Hounds.  Later Ron Hill continued writing it.
     After Ron stopped to post I (i.e. Uli Grepel) continued this with a
     halfway rewrite.

     DR2:   David Reff &lt;dsearch@aol.com&gt;
     RH:    Ron Hill &lt;76375.3340@compuserve.com&gt;
     RMC:   Robb McCaffree &lt;nsrjm@nursepo.medctr.ucla.edu&gt;

[Ron Hill's work properly credited, and a couple of new entries]

Sigh, sometimes the diff's are longer than some other FAQs that get posted...
Since by now the FAQ is seriously close to the 100 KB mark. (What? 100 Kate-Bushs?
Are you dreaming??! ;-) ) - what is the general opinion on splitting it into
a multi-part FAQ? It'll mean more work to me, a long wait for approval by the
overloaded *.answers moderation team, and I generally don't like 'small' postings
(which a 100KB posting still can be seen for me and the software I use) to be
split.

Bye,

Uli
