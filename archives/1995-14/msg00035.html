"UnderToad emerges from the shadows of lurking..."

It seems semi-traditional to begin with an AA greeting;  I'll keep it
short with:

I have been a fan since Kate's '78 SNL appearance.  I
thought _Them Heavy People_ was "cute", but _The Man With the Child In
His Eyes_ blew me away.

Register the HoL album as my PERSONAL favorite.

Favs: Classic Yes, TH/Byrne, Neil Young, Indigo Girls, Pink Floyd, the Runt

There is no musical style (notice intentional avoidance of the
word "genre") that I cannot abide, with the possible exception of
whining bluegrass vocals.

I just recently got Internet access, and immediately subscribed to L-H.
Working my way through the ENTIRE archive, I am up to January '87.
(Boy, there's a lot of stuff in there!  I can't WAIT to see what
happens when _The Sensual World_ "comes out", and then _The Red Shoes_!)

THE RUB:  I just got Nanci Griffith's latest, _Flyer_, and  I am wondering
whether the CD is defective.
The chorus of the song "Nobody's Angel" has a repeated counterpoint vocal
"She's out of the country now".
About 3:30 into the track the vocal appears to *skip*, coming out
as a garbled "She's out of", but the music
seems to stay in tempo through the passage.
I have not noticed Nanci doing vocal *processing* before, but then
the track also has things like Tony Levin
playing the digeridoo (her spelling) and dogs barking. 

Do I have a bum CD, or is this intentional?
Is there anyone out there
willing to admit to listening to Nanci and can confirm that my CD isn't
corrupt?

L-H can be proud that it caused me to spend $180 on a UK pressing of
_This Woman's Work_ (I didn't know it existed)!
If I am to be flamed, toast me for never joining a fan club--my face is
a-blush.

-- UnderToad (I was going to use "Phaedrus", but Rossi just (1987-1-29)
mentioned _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_.  Rats!!)

(Weird line breaks courtesy of "Cut and Paste and Laziness".)

To paraphase the Runt:
"Love among the ugly
  is the most beautiful love of all."
