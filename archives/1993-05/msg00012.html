&gt;&gt;What, intelligent critical faculties?

&gt;Here, let me help stretch your arm so's to make patting yourself on the 
&gt;back a bit easier:  &lt;yank&gt;  &lt;snap&gt;

&gt;Oh dear, I seem to've broken your arm.  Now how will you straighten your
&gt;halo?

&gt;Once again you're confusing subjectivity and objectivity.

I don't know about "once again".  This is the first time I've done that in a
while!  :)

But seeriously, what halo?  The name is "Drewcifer"!

&gt;&gt;Well, actually, I thought this song was remarkably trite.  Guess it's harder
&gt;&gt;than we thought!

&gt;You think the lyrics are trite or the music?  You completely ignored my
&gt;comment about the music, a fact I find interesting.  Don't you agree that
&gt;a large part of the power in any such piece is the synthesis between the
&gt;music and lyrics, the sum of which is far greater than the parts?

I didn't ignore anything, actually.  I think the lyrics are painfully
trite, and I found nothing remarkable about the music.  I agree that the
synthesis is very important, but I don't think anything wonderful resulted
from it on FBP.


&gt;&gt;Wait a minute.  In order to be sincere you can't care about a wide range of
&gt;&gt;issues?

&gt;Nope, I didn't say that.  I said that Natalie Merchant spends too much of
&gt;_Blind Man's Zoo_ explaining to us just how much She Cares.

That's your perception and cynicism, which you bring to the record,
overlaying her intentions.  I agree that she does some pretentious I Am A
Saint stuff, but I really didn't get that on this album.  I thought it was
quite brilliant stuff and addressed the issues in story form and not Look
How Terrible This Is form.  The new album does have some self-indulgent
tunes on it, but I think you're putting attitudes on Natalie's lyrics from
BMZ that they just don't display.
 
&gt;&gt;I care about a lot of issues too, and I'm quite sincere about all
&gt;&gt;of them.

&gt;And yet you've managed to refrain from cataloging them here for us.

Oh, this is just wonderful!  I'm damned if I go on and on about what I
believe in, and I'm also damned if I don't.  If you *really* want me to list
a bunch of issues so that you can think up some snappy comeback, I could
easily do so.  But I doubt anyone wants to waste bandwidth on it, so if
that's what you want, I'll E-mail it to you.


&gt;&gt;I think that might not be the way you meant to express this.

&gt;Nope, I said exactly what I meant.  You took the comment out of the
&gt;context of Natalie Merchant and _Blind Man's Zoo_ and applied it globally.

Well, yes, but even in the context it's inaccurate.  As I explained above.

&gt;BTW, on a completely different subject, glad to hear you're enjoying
&gt;_Warpaint_ so much.  Come join us on Ecto, the Happy Rhodes mailing list.
&gt;Send mail to jessica, the listgoddess.  She can be reached at 
&gt;ecto-request@ns1.rutgers.edu  We've got close to 125 subscribers now, and
&gt;Ecto is available as loose mail or in digest form.

I'm still enraptured by the disc...I used to be so fond of various albums
that I'd actually carry them around with me.  Ever since I bought _Warpaint_
it hasn't left my presence!

I shall indeed join you.

&gt;Jeff
