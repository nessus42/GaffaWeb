We bought at Tower, and finally had a chance to listen to the
"Games Without Frontiers" remix on the b-side of the "Steam"
cassingle, and it's *GREAT*!!! It's *completely* different.
The best I could do to describe it would be to say.....uh...
...something like.... the "acoustic dub" mix. At first I
thought that Kate was taken out altogether, but later in
the song she comes in singing her part in a very soft,
ethereal way. I'm sure it's not new vocals by either Peter
or Kate, but I do think they are alternative recordings.
You know Peter, he'll record something fifty million ways
then choose which one to use. Oh to have free run of his
archives!

Btw, we didn't see a CD single, though I'm sure one exists.

Jane Siberry is on the Toys soundtrack too!!

&gt;&gt;Speaking of crossword puzzles...no, I guess we weren't. Anyway, my
&gt;&gt;last name once showed up in a find-a-word puzzle in a KBC newsletter.
&gt;&gt;To this day i don't know if it was intentional or some weird fluke
&gt;&gt;of fate. Speaking of my last name, which is Mapes, one of the lead
&gt;&gt;characters on last week's episode of MST3K (the title of the film
&gt;&gt;escapes me) was named Mapes too. Doesn't that ever so just make your
&gt;&gt;day to know that? Joel &amp; the Bots have mentioned Kate, so hey, it's
&gt;&gt;kinda Kate-related.

&gt;And of course, in Frank Herbert's _Dune_, (you're probably already aware of
&gt;this, Vickie) there was a minor character, the Shadout Mapes.  Your eyes aren't
&gt;blue-on-blue, are they...? 

No, I didn't know that! Thanks for letting me know. (And no, I don't
have eyes like that, but they sound interesting. My eyes are brown and
I always wanted blue eyes. Icy blue, like Kirstie Alley or Meg Foster.)

Weirdly enough, last night on the Emma Thompson show, she used the last
name "Mapes" in one of her skits. To make it even weirder, my maiden name
was Thompson! Odd happenings...
