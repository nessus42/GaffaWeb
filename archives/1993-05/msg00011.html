Just got back from seeing the new Robin Williams movie, _Toys_.  
Unfortunately, I can't say too much good about it.  The friend I saw it
with and I agree that it had some really great parts and some really
wretched parts, and that it could have been *lots* better.

So why am I posting?  The music, of course!

Like everything about _Toys_, the music had good moments and bad moments.

One good moment was the use of Enya's "Ebudae" (from _Shepherd Moons_).
Another good "moment" (so to speak) is the fact that during the ochestrated
portions of the soundtrack, one of the focal instruments is the uillean
pipe.  Quite beautiful, really.

And the most intersting (to me...) point about the soundtrack:

New music from Tori!  Well, sort of.  I suspect it may have just been
new vocals, because the song didn't sound like _anything_ I've heard from
her.  In fact, I didn't even realize who it was 'til I saw the credits
(how embarassing!)  I sat there during the entire time the song was playing
trying to figure out who it was, knowing it was somebody I really liked
but having no idea _who_.  I attribute this to the arrangement and 
type of song, which was very electronic.  Piano?  We don' need no *steenkin'*
piano!

The soundtrack album is supposed to be available from DGC.  Dunno whether
or not it's available, nor if the Tori song is on it, though I'd guess it
is.  BTW, the name of the song is "Happy Workers".  

(I was so surprised to see the name "Tori Amos" appear on the screen during
the credits that I didn't catch the songwriter, etc.)
