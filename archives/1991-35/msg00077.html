Thegood Lord in heaven has blessed the city of Chicago with a Tower
Records.  It's about time Tower started getting their act together
in the midwest.  Now, for the first time, under one roof, without
having to special order anything, we can get bucketo imports and small/
indy label stuff that, as the clerk said, are easy to get, but most
stores just don't bother.  Plus, homeground magazines (!), Kate Bush 
books (well just 2 so far), etc. etc.  

For people in other cities this may not sound like a big deal,
but I will be spending lots of time there now.

Since I have been limited in my net access recently (I've been downloading
lots and reading offline), I'll just add that I have become enamoured
of the TWW Disk One singles, in particular the 1st 5 that appear there,
and even more specifically, The Empty Bullring.  This is an amazing
song (so, ok, they all are, hey).  Could somebody post the lyrics to it?
My guess as to the story (not too deep) is that it is about an
old matador who returns to the [insert song title here] and his
wife (???) is bemoaning this nostalgia.  My favorite part (musically)
is the way the end of the main text segues into the chorus.
The piano appears to be building to a crescendo in a downward progression
of chords (in my mind it sounds like DA de de DA de de DA da) but
it stops there and she finishes it as the chorus which against expectation
is soft and delicate.  Ooooh I love that.

For those Kirsty MacColl fans out ther, she is appearing in Chicago 
as one of two openers for Squeeze.  I wish she would play in a whole
show of her own!!!  But it will be great to finally get to see her.
Question: does anyone know whether pre-Kite stuff is out on CD at all?
Why not?  Can the LPs be found anywhere convenient?

Well, that's it for now.  [BTW, I also *love* the alternative hounds
of love rendition on TWW disk 2.  IED once said that this is a 
perfect complement to the original... overlay them on a tape
to see (I have yet to do this except in my mind...)]
