Regarding Richard Caldwell's Kate/Catherine/TSW comments, I
wholeheartedly agree.  While I have not been a Katefan as long
as most of the LoveHounds, I like her very much, and have
learned alot about her by listening to her, as well as reading
LoveHounds.  However, the shoddy engineering on The Sensual
World is evident evn to a relatively engineering oblivious
person such as I.  I think it was muddy and hissy.

I agree with Richard that Heads We're Dancing si an excellent
song, and actually, did not really need the VERY obvious
reference to Hitler.  For me, it sort of makes the song a bit,
ohhh, I dunno... garish, perhaps.  As opposed to keeping it
dark, mysterious and menacing, letting our imaginations run
wild, it becomes very "earthbound" for me.  Nonetheless, I
still enjoy the song very much, I think it was well written
overall, the music captures the lyrical ideas very well.  Too
bad the audio quality of it sucks.

As for the Kate/Catherine thing, the  whole "Catherine"
supposition is darn near too presumptuous, and not to mention
sycophantic, to even believe an adult could come up with it.
It sounds like the musings of an adolescent who's idol didn't
do as well as he/she had hoped, so he/she rationalizes the
idol's performance with some ridiculous hyperbole.  I mean,
come on, at least deal in _reality_, huh?  I damn near busted
an eyesocket from rolling 'em so hard on that one!  Well,
everybody's got an opinion, and that was mine.  Party on,
and on an unrelated note, PLEASE, neuter your pets!
