Vickie here.

Melissa quotes me:

&gt;&gt; First of all, why should Robyn get away with posting such a statement
&gt;&gt; as she did? It was stated as if she had some kind of inside information,
&gt;&gt; which she doesn't. It was stated as if it were true, which it isn't.

and says:

&gt; On this point I agree with you.  When making a post such as Robyn's 
&gt; regarding the tour, it should be said whether the statements are opinions 
&gt; or fact.  If the remarks are fact, then the source of the information 
&gt; should also be included.  However, it is presumptuous for anyone to
&gt; assume that Robyn does not have access to such information.

Why is it presumptious? I wrote that *after* I had spoken to Peter David
Fitzgerald-Morris, who is one person removed from Kate herself. He said
the statement Robyn made was untrue. She has no inside information.
End of story.

&gt;&gt; covered. Aren't emotional writings part of that? I guess not. Cynthia,
&gt;&gt; Richard Caldwell, Jon Drukman, Larry Spence and others don't think so.
&gt;&gt; Why do these people feel the *need* to discourage emotion? Why can't I
&gt;&gt; complain about their lack of sensitivity? Without emotions, without

&gt; All Richard did was make a post which  differed from your opinions, and
&gt; you attack him.  

I wasn't attacking his ideas. If you had read my posts, you would have seen
that I conceeded that he may well be right on many points. My problems
had to do with the tone of his post. Very scornful and cynical. He treats
Kate (and those who may like what he doesn't) like an idiot, instead of a
human being who did something he disagreed with.  

&gt; You accuse him of being  "bitchy, cynical" and insensitive.
&gt; I am demanding an apology for these rude and unfeeling statements. 

OK. I'm sorry that Richard is bitchy, cynical and insensitive. Ooops,
I'm sorry I said it in public. 
 
&gt; I will not allow such statements about Richard to go unchallenged.  
&gt; He is perfectly capable of taking care of himself, but you need to
&gt; be aware that I will tenaciously defend him if further comments of 
&gt; this sort are made.  

Fine. Where were you when Richard called Chris "potentially dangerous"
just because Chris questioned the Little Light people's truthfulness.
 
&gt; When you start spouting crap about "emotion stompers" you'd better take a 
&gt; very good look at how insensitive you can be when responding to the posts 
&gt; of others.

You're absolutely right. Cynicism and insensitivity is catching. I'm
coming down with it myself. I'll go back to being Little Miss Sweetness
and Light, who puts a Sugar Coating on everything.
