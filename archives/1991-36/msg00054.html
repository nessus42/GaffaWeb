&gt;&gt; Reading today's Digest was like reading the transcript of a table
&gt;&gt; conversation in a junior-high cafeteria.  Someone ranking on Jorn,
&gt;&gt; Jorn ranking back, everybody ranking on Robyn, Vickie ranking and
&gt;&gt; ranking...
&gt;
&gt;First of all, why should Robyn get away with posting such a statement
&gt;as she did? It was stated as if she had some kind of inside information,
&gt; [CUT]
&gt;You want I should congratulate her?

No, you can disagree and criticize, just as she did.
&gt;
&gt;Secondly, Jessica said this in an unrelated post:


&gt;a factual error, by all means, flame away. But if it concerns *my* emotions,
&gt;what business is it of *anyone* to tell me I'm wrong? If no one wants to
&gt;hear my emotions speaking, they can skip over what I say. 

Why can't people have diagreeing emotions?

&gt;If people feel
&gt;that rec.music.gaffa is not the place to write from an emotional point-
&gt;of-view, then what's wrong with e-mail? Gaffa is supposed to be a place
&gt;where all points of views can be heard and lots of different subjects
&gt;covered. Aren't emotional writings part of that? I guess not. 

I don't think anyone said that emotional things shouldn't be posted,
since this entire subject seems quite emotional. It's just dribble that
people dislike. And what is dribble to one person, maybe the greatest
thing since Orgenon to another.
&gt;
&gt;No, I'll most likely never write another emotion-laden article for this
&gt;newsgroup, so the emotion-stompers won't have anything to tear apart. 

This sounds emotion-laden. Does it count?

&gt; Richard Caldwell
&gt;wrote a fascinating and thought-provoking article about his own reactions
&gt;to TSW. He ruined it by coming off sounding very cynical and bitchy and he
&gt;even made it a point to refer to Jorn's article. No reason for it, he'd
&gt;made his point. He just wanted to show us all what his steel-hardened
&gt;heart looked like, I guess. It was fascinating too.

Better watch out. He may vow never to post something again.

This is an interesting phenomenon (or should I say "strange"). People are
criticizing others for being critical. And then some are criticizing
those who are criticizing the critical. And so on. Mmmm, yes.
