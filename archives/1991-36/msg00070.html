&gt;&gt;You seem to be confused.  The three best in-sucession songs ever recorded
&gt;&gt;are "Infant Kiss," "Night Scented Stock" and "Army Dreamers."  However,
&gt;&gt;"Army Dreamers" remains the best of those three.

Boris answered:
&gt;What? A song about virtual child molestation? Ha! You philistine!
&gt;I'd go with TMwtCiHE, WH, and JatCG as the best in a series.

Hunh?  Where's the flow between the songs?  I'll admit that "The Man With
the Child In His Eyes", followed by WH is a wonderful combination,  But
I hardly that that JatCG fits in terribly well with the other two songs.  
It doesn't continue the same sort of flow that "my" three songs
do.  

What I like about these three songs is that they're very different and yet
they all blend together perfectly well.  "Night Scented Stock" is like a 
perfect little segue for the other two songs, while standing beautifully
on its own.  It captures the beautiful bitter-sweet magic of IK and AD
in its discordant harmonies.  

As for child molestation, I'll point out that the songs you named include
drug use, prostitution, the occult, and god knows what else (I'm too lazy
to look at Chris' PMRC sheet to find out the *real* scoop on everything
that's wrong with your three songs...;-)

Someone else asked what "JatCG" was in another message.  To whomever that
was:  in case you haven't guessed by now, the song is James and the Cold
Gun.  Boris and I have been talking about "songs in succession," ie songs
that go together very well in the order in which they appear on an album.
My favorite are from _Never For Ever_ (tracks 8-10) while Boris' are from
_The Kick Inside_ (tracks 5-7).

Jeff
