Hmmm, in e-mail I was threateneed with "exposure" wrt my December e-mail
to Sabina, which she's now using as an excuse to unsubscribe.  I find it
very strange.  If I'd wanted to keep the flame war in gaffa, I would
have posted my response then, instead of e-mailing it.  I tried to
spare gaffa, and still got roasted for past flame wars, and now for
"making" someone unsubscribe.  Very strange.

I still want to spare gaffa, but I want to counteract this "threat"
of exposure of private e-mail, so I am putting both Sabina's original
post (a *public* post, to gaffa, available in the archives) and my
e-mail to her (*MY* private e-mail, not hers) in my .plan file.  I'm
not posting her response to me, but did include the excerpt where she
makes her threat.  I don't like threats, and I don't think it's good
netiquette. 

If anyone has anything to say to me about this, *E-MAIL* me.  Keep
it out of gaffa.  I will *NOT* respond, or probably even read, anything
posted to rec.music.gaffa/Love-Hounds, so save the bandwidth.

I suggest using: finger vickie@pilot.njin.net |more

Sabina, you don't have to unsubscribe.  The "Tarot Wars" were not that
flamey, and were totally unimportant.   Flame wars have been happening in 
gaffa/LH since Day 1, and they'll always be a part of it.  Your post caught
me in a bad mood, but I won't apologise for anything in my reply, except
for the profanity.  I will not take responsibility for your unsubscribing,
nor will I back down in the face of net.blackmail.  Gaffians already know
that I can be a bitch on wheels, so it's no secret, and I am *especially*
bitchy when someone I've loved and lived with for 13 years (Chris) is being
told to unsubscribe by an oversensitive newbie.  I have nothing against
newbies (new to Kate or the newsgroup/mailing list) so no one should hold
that comment over my head.  Still, I'm not going to *not* say what I feel,
and I'm saying what I feel now.  

If someone says something controversial, they're going to get replies.
Chris knew that when he posted his anti-Tarot post.  You should have
known that when you posted your anti-Chris post.  You chose to make your
post public, while I chose to make my reply private.  Now, here you are,
saying publically that you're unsubscribing because of responses you got.
I don't know if my response was the only one, but even if it was, I'm
not going to apologise for responding to a public post.  If you don't
want replies, don't post.  If you don't want responses via e-mail, write
"no e-mail accepted wrt this post" at the bottom of your posts.  If you
get e-mail that bothers you, you don't have to unsubscribe because of it.
Deal with it.  Conflicts are part of life, you know.  I e-mailed you again
wrt your Unsubscribe post (asking what we were supposed to think about)
and you respond by threatening to post private e-mail?  Makes no sense
to me, and I'll be happy to make it public first to show you that it makes 
*no* difference to me if gaffians know that I blew up at you.  I didn't
e-mail it because I didn't want gaffians to know I was pissed off, I
e-mailed it because I didn't want to add to the flame war in public. 
*That's* why I said not to bring it into gaffa.  You did anyway.  Nice.
Sabina, I won't be e-mailing you again, so your threat was meaningless
anyway.
