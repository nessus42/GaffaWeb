Vote now!!! (Respond this poll. Give others to fill it. I need as many
responds as possible).

This is, I hope, the finite version of the poll. I may need still rephrase
some of the questions (I'm not a native english speaker - so I need your help 
doing it), but as for categories and fields, I'll make as few changes 
as possible. If you still think I forgot something which is important,
just email me.

% Usenet musical preferance poll (Ver 1.0)

% About MPP (Musical Preferance POLL):
%
% This poll, is not a short term poll, like other polls set up to answer
% questions like "What is the best alternative album of 1994" or "who is the
% best harmonica player of 1956". The goal of MPP is to gather data from as
% many people as possible.
% This poll could be used to answer question like "What is the most popular
% album among a certain population", "What is the most popular album of certain
% genre", "Who is the best keyboardist" etc. Almost infinate number of questions,
% providing I'll get enough responses for some meaningfull statistics.
% 
% The answers to such questions will be posted to the relevant newsgroups,
% and also will be kept in some music-related FTP sites. I'll also welcome
% suggestions for database queries from others. I also hope I could make the
% whole database available for the internet users.
%
% As I wrote before, The poll will succeed, and give interesting results only
% if I'll get enough responds, so help this project by passing this form to
% as many people as possible.
%
%
% Instuctions:
%
% 1. This poll is oriented towards a wide range of music listeners, from
%    rap, dance and techno to classical. No matter what kind of music you listen
%    to. If you listen to music of any kind - I need your response.
%
% 2. You don't have to answer all categories. Just fill in as many as you
%    like. Send the form even if you answered only one category.
%
% 3. You can write less then the number of entries specified in each category.
%    If you feel you must - you can also fill in 1-2 items more than specified.
%    My database  prog. can handle this. Just don't exagerate. In 10 Best albums,
%    you may respond with up to 20 albums (10 is just the recommanded number).
%
% 4. Try not to change the stracture of the form. I use an automated 
%    procedure to process the data.
%
% 5. Email your response to s2974751@techunix.technion.ac.il, with the subj.
%    line: Music preferance POLL.
%
%
% Notes:
%
% I recieved some questions about how to classify musical genres. I think it
% is up to you to decide what is a musical genre, just keep in mind that
% there could be usefull statistics about albums of certain genre only
% if there would be enough people to rank albums of this genre.
% Someone asked me whether a classical listner should devide things into
% broad periods (like baroque, midieval etc.) or ensamble types.
% The answer for this is: You can divide thing by any creteria you'd like.
% Only keep in mind what I already mentioned above, so don't come up with
% a genre like "Progressive midieval music".
