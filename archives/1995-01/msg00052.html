                             By Keith Abbott
                             Sunday@infi.net

  in the /pub/music/artists/innocence.mission directory.

Where do I email the Emailing groups moderator?

How many albums are there?
 
 - There are currently 3 albums, and one EP. The first release was an EP
   called "Tending The Rose Garden" (1986 LLIST Records). Their debut
   album was self-titled (1989 A&amp;M), their 2nd album was entitled
   "Umbrella" (1991 A&amp;M), and their soon to be released album is entitled
   "Glow" (1995 A&amp;M).
 
How can I obtain the EP "Tending The Rose Garden?"
 
 - You must look LONG and HARD. Only 5,000 copies were printed (so Don
   Peris says). If you actually *DO* find one, let us know. Be prepared
   to pay top dollar.
 
Are bootlegs obtainable? If so, how?
 
 - Yes, there are quite a few bootlegs floating around and they are
   obtainable. If you have questions as to where to get them, please
   email me at Sunday@infi.net.
   
Which bootlegs are of the best quality?
 
 - There are many excellent quality tapes. The WMMR Show in 1988',
   WBER Radio Show, 1992 Tours at 9:30 Club and Chameleon Club, Club
   Lingerie (1991), The Roxy (1990), Saturday Sequence (London) and
   The Coach House (1992).
 
Is there a fan club?
 
 - No. Karen (cannot speak for the rest of the band because I don't
   know their feelings on this matter) doesn't particularly like
   the idea. She feels the mailing list that they run suffices in
   what they are trying to accomplish. The address to send your
   letters and questions to:
 
        The Innocence Mission
        P.O. Box 837
        Lancaster, PA 17603
 
 
Where and what is Medjugorje?
 
 - Medjugorje, Yugoslavia claims to have been the site were the
   ghost of the Virgin Mary has been appearing for the past 14
   years. Karen wrote the song from the perspective of someone
   coming home from there, meshed with the devotions of her
   grandmother. The song was also dedicated to her grandmother,
   who died on the eve of the song's completion.
 
How many videos are there?
 
 - 4. "Black Sheep Wall," "I Remember Me," "Wonder of Birds," and
   "And Hiding Away." All but one recieved airplay on MTV and
   VH-1. The exception was "And Hiding Away" which was shot
   using live footage from their studio in Lancaster, PA.
 
Are there any tour dates scheduled currently?
 
 - No, but there could be a tour starting early as February/March of 1995.
 
What is IM's connection with Amy Grant?
 
 - The song "Shadows" was originally written by Karen Peris and
   recorded by The Innocence Mission (1986 Tending The Rose Garden).
   Amy Grant eventually heard the song, liked it and then wanted
   to record it. Since The Innocence Mission really had no desire
   to play it again, Karen let her re-write the lyrics to her own
   satisfaction. The song was re-released on Amy Grant's album,
   "Lead Me On."
 
Is there a reason "Mercy" has never been played live (that we know of)?
 
 - Nobody knows.
 
Are there any Newsletters for IM?
 
- Only the ones that the I have made. Currently, there are 2 newsletters.
  The first of which was a one page B&amp;W. And the 2nd was 2 paged and
  came in both B&amp;W and Color. If you wish to get copies. Send email
  to me. There is also a 3rd currently in the works.
 
When is their next album due out?
 
- Currently it's due April 4th, 1995. They recorded the new album in Houston
  and New Orleans, and completed the mixing in Seattle. A CD5 single
  for "Bright As Yellow" is currently to be released late in January with
  one other album track and two non-lp tracks. A European A&amp;M promo
  compilation entitled, "There's More Beyond Words" is due to be released
  this January or February with 2 songs. An A&amp;M promotional sampler called,
  "The Interrupted Cow" has been released in the US which also contains
  the single, "Bright As Yellow." No other information is available about
  this sampler.
 
Are Don and Karen Peris married or brother and sister?
 
- They have been married for quite awhile now. So nope, she's not
  single.
 
Is there a Web site for The Innocence Mission?
 
- Currently, no. Unfortunately, I do not have access to a color scanner. I
  also do not know where to begin on setting up a site as well. If anyone is
  interested in helping getting one started, I would love to help.
 
Was Umbrella ever released in Europe?
 
- It seems it was not released in the UK. No catalog numbers have been
  found, however a catalog number has been located for Germany.
  This is unconfirmed however.
 
Are Karen and Don Christian?
 
- Actually, the whole band grew up in Lancaster, PA. They all went to Catholic
  school there, and they are still practicing Catholics.
 
Between tours do The Innocence Mission perform locally in Lancaster?
 
- Yes, but to my knowledge only in Church. They also have a small studio
  where they practice.
 
Is it true Larry Klein is no longer producing IM's albums?
 
- Yes, Dennis Herring, a former Camper Van Beethoven producer, produced
  "Glow." Apparently, due to conflicts in schedules they were not able to
  obtain Larry.
