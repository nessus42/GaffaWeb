Subject: HG 54; FAQ correKTion?

IED cannot praise highly enough the latest issue of Homeground
(No. 54, Winter '94).  Congratulations to Peter FitzGerald-Morris, and to
Krys and Dave, for giving us a new level of excellence to appreciate and
aspire to. Not only does this issue contain several Kate Bush news bits that
have not appeared in  Love-Hounds (no mean feat that, in itself!), but there
is an always interesting (though by no means infallible!) review of The Red
Shoes album by rec.music.gaffa's founder |&gt;oug /\lan, and an absolutely
fascinating and beautifully written article from our own KLN (Karen Newcombe)
which offers inspired
insight into symbolism in "Under the Ivy".  As if that weren't enough, there
are also several photographs of Kate Bush that 
have never (to IED's knowledge) appeared anywhere before.
Thanks, Peter, for your continuing, invaluable contribution.

 &gt;No one (except Kate, as far as I know - [SB])
 &gt;knows who anyone else is in this song, especially "George the
 &gt;Wipe".

Actually, IED believes that "Teddy" has been identified
as the late John Barratt, assistant engineer at Abbey Road Studios during the
recording sessions for "Never For Ever". 
Kate once revealed his nickname to be Teddy.

Also, an excellent theory about the meaning of "George the 
Wipe" was offered in Love-Hounds several months back.  Anyone
remember, and can any UK member offer further insight into
this reference?

     Today I saw the Hammersmith video and CD package in Tower Video.  It
was $29 and some cents.  The CD is exclusive to this package.  My question
is, will there be a laserdisc version?  It seems kind of pointless to buy
this package when a disc would give a better picture AND the CD sound
playing together all at the same time &lt;G&gt;    Or would you try to sync it
up?  Just joking there.     

Will there be a laserdisc?     Rick

&gt;For me, some of her best video work is also the most recent--"The Line,
&gt;the Cross, and the Curve," which I just got on laserdisc.  "The Red Shoes"
&gt;segment is stunning.
My favorite video is "Live at Hammesmith Odeon" Its a perfect example of Kate
when she was ar her best

Did anybody see The Red Shoes - the movie recently ? Sunday night I think,
on BBC2 in the early evening. I've videod it for future viewing but the big
question is do I
1) rush home and watch
2) watch it at my leisure
3) not bother

Any comments on the film would be welcome.

I've seen the Red Shoes a couple times and bits and pieces of it more often. I 
think it is a wonderful, beautiful movie.  Here is waht influmential American 
Film critic Pauline Kael had to say about it:


The most "imaginative" and elaborate backstage musical ever filmed, and many 
have called it great. The film contains a 14-minute ballet, also called "The Red 
Shoes," based on a Hans Christian Andersen story about a wicked shoemaker who 
sells an enchanted pair of slippers to a young girl. Delighted at first with the 
slippers in which she dances joyously, she discovers that the slippers will not 
let her stop dancing—and the bewitched, exhausted girl dies. The film's story 
is, of course, the same story, spelled out in more complicated terms, with the 
shoemaker of the ballet (Léonide Massine) replaced by the megalomaniac ballet 
impresario (Anton Walbrook). The exquisite young Moira Shearer is the ballerina; 
the cast includes Marius Goring as the young composer, Robert Helpmann, Albert 
Basserman, Ludmilla Tcherina, and Esmond Knight. Blubbery and self-conscious, 
but it affects some people passionately, and it's undeniably some kind of 
classic. Written, produced, and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric 
Pressburger—master purveyors of high kitsch. Choreography by Helpmann; music by 
Brian Easdale; conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. 

"Copyright (c) 1993, Microsoft Corp." - from their excellent Cinemania CD-ROM.

Happy viewing,
