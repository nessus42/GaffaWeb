&gt;Hi!
&gt;
&gt;Chris, your e-dress is too hellacious for me to figure out how to type in my
&gt;cold-medicine-dreamstate, but I submit for everyone's approval one nice thing
&gt;to say about Rush Limbaugh, that you may manage to score copies of the Fruit-
&gt;opia ads from your friend:
&gt;
&gt;   He has the sense not to wear a toupee on the air.

I'll add another couple of nice things you can say for Flush Rimjob, err..., 
Rush Limbaugh.  

1)  He keeps a very neat desk.

2)  He has the decency to keep his body _covered_ at all times.

3)  He is probably responsible for giving millions of formerly illiterate
people the incentive to finally runout and buy Hooked on Phonics so that 
they could actually read (mouthing the words under their breath and nodding 
in agreement the whole while, no doubt...) his books.

Anything to get those ads in the next Lovehounds Collection!

Anyway, back to KT/Gaffa for a moment:

1)  Finally got to watch the Lovehounds Collection in its entirety this past
weekend:  wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!  Excellent work and a great 
big thanks to everyone involved!  Sharp work on The Infant Kiss, Chris!
Winces and "arrrggh"s galore during the Night Flight interview.  Anyone care
to specualte on just which drugs the members of Dr. Hook were on?

2)  Regarding our latest little flare-up:  Jeez, people, could we all please 
just _relax_?  I am _so_ sick of these petty little pissing contests popping 
up again and again.  Granted, I wasn't particularly thrilled with or excited 
about the whole Tarot thing, but Chris's pouncing (which was both tempermental 
and ill-informed re: tarot and mysticism) was particularly uncalled for.  Said 
so at the time, but the post seemed to get swallowed by my previously 
malfunctioning server.  

Chris and Vickie, we all know you take great pride and have a tremendous 
personal stake in gaffa, but has it occurred to either of you that there is 
quite a bit of validity to the observation that you both tend to keep landing 
feet-first in the middle of every flame-fest that pops up around here?  I've 
been alternately lurking and posting here for almost two years, now, and 
that's really the way it looks, _especially_ to newcomers.  

Actually, I'd say it is a bit more accurate to state that you've both been 
coming across as pretty stressed and snippy the last few weeks.  Holiday
stress, perhaps?  

Anyhow, I'm not saying that your _intentions_ are wrong (Chris's pounce 
regarding including /+) on the next Lovehounds Coll. was certainly correct,
and the entire KTarot idea is just plain silly, IMHO):  it's just your approaches
that seem a bit, I don't know, strident.  Very off-putting.  Certainly not very
conducive to reasonable discussions.  

Whatever.  Back to listening.  

-- Gregg!
