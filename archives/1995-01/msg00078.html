&gt;This was detailed by IED a few months back.  Although this is the first 
&gt;I've heard of university students being involved, the company in Santa 
&gt;Monica who were subconsultants to Chiat/Day were the ones who picked 
&gt;Kate.  They also did the animation of the fruit.  

   Not exactly. The actual animation was done in NYC at the very cool
post production facility, Click3X. The tabletop photography of the
various arrays of fruit was texture mapped onto 3D objects and animated
in SoftImage. The rendered images were further manipulated and blended
in "Flame", the software de jour. All this was detailed in Post
magazine.

    BTW, we should start looking for the spots again. The billboards and
subway posters have reappeard in Chicago, and I caught one of the spots
on TV this weekend. I might be able to talk a TV station friend here
into getting me copies of the ads, if they are being locally inserted.
The only problem; he may force me to say something nice about Rush
Limbaugh in exchange.

&gt;If I remember correctly, Kate was their first and only choice.  They sent 
&gt;her demos of the video sequences for her to compose from.  

   The Post article had it differently. They (exactly who I cannot
remember) tried a few different artists with the "animatics", semi-
animated sequences of shots of the storyboards with the camera panning
and zooming around the still images.

   Remember. This is *advertising people* we are talking about. When you
lie for a living it's hard to keep your story straight.
