In response to jenn's post I thought I would forward a review of one of these
shows from the 10km mailing list (yes, one fianally exsists) if you want on it
send mail to mus0eka@cabell.vcu.edu (there is alos an Innocence Mission list
run from the same address)

anyway from the review it sounds like the Maniacs have escaped their dry spell
I was really worried that they were creatively dead/dying so this is much
welcome news.

&gt;Of the new songs, I'll say that in general they're much better than
&gt;those on Blind Man's Zoo, on which I think the lyrics were often
&gt;fighting with the music, and have much more of the lyrical character

Hmm, they just sounded like a semi-forced IMT mkII...here is the review of the
show:

God...what an amazing show.  Working for security, I placed myself right in 
front of the stage, in front of Natalie's keyboard.  But more on that later.

Musically, the new stuff they played (which was about 1/3 to 1/2 of the show)
is a little more progressive than previous albums, in a Cowboy Junkies "let's 
jam a little" mode. Natalie plays the keyboard a lot more now...on all the new
songs, I think.  I wasn't able to get or copy the setlist, but the old songs
they played, from memory, were predominantly from In My Tribe.  In no 
particular order, they performed What's the Matter Here?, Kerouac, Weather,
Don't Talk (the final song of the encore--really thrashy and distorted--
surprising), Sister Rose, Campfire Song; off of Blind Man's Zoo, Trouble Me,
and Eat for Two...maybe one other...sorry, I should have written this sooner.
And yeah, I was disappointed they didn't do Verdi Cries.

Natalie sightings/meetings during the day:
o I was in the campus center, where their dressing rooms were, helping with
  security there.  Natalie was playing with a pink rubber ball...rolling it
  down the stairs...it slipped away from her, landed near me.  When I handed
  it back to her, she said "super ball...lots of fun".
o Before the show, she was hanging out in front of the stage, off to the side,
  not far from the crowd who didn't notice her because she's so damn short and
  looks like an Amherst student anyway (put some commas in there, sorry :) ). 
  I noticed here and directed some friends of mine over there...they talked to
  her for about 20 minutes.  During the show, she left the stage to go into
  the crowd to dance with them for awhile...right near where I was.
o Just before she went backstage, I told her how psyched I was to have her at
  Amherst...said something about it making me feel "all ticklish inside".  So
  she reached over and tickled me.  
o Post-show, I went back to Natalie's dressing room, where about 8 of us hung
  out with her for about two hours, drinking tea, talking and (in Natalie's 
  case) helping put on an impromptu puppet show with napkins.  She's a really
  sweet, warm person, not the bitch she's usually portrayed as...but she is
  just as innocent as she comes off on stage as being.

Ok, so I have a Natalie fetish.  Granted.  If y'all have any questions about
the show in any fashion, I'll be glad to answer...and no, I couldn't tape it.
Sorry.

&gt;It's certainly nice to have something to look forward to from this
&gt;group.  Any one else get a chance to see them?
Yes it is!!!!!

Ob Kate (thanks to those who hung in this far)

Over on the Marillion list someone mentioned a rumour that Fish (ex-Marillion)
and Kate might tour England togther sometime in the comming year.  He didn't
mention his sources, has anyone else heard anything solid on this?  Or indeed
on KT touring at all as she said she might?
