        I agree that "we let the weirdness in" is the secret message and 
that there is no backwards message.  However, I agree with Jackie that there 
is a voice going on in the background at about 3:00 to 3:15.  Whether or not 
is forwards or backwards or what it is saying I don't know.

yeah.  i think skinny puppy's vegetarianism arises out of a general sense of 
animal rights whereas kate's seems more based on just eating smart. 
 
        This is, of course, possible, but in interviews Kate tends to 
mention the health aspect only in passing, and concentrates more on the 
animal rights stuff.  The only time she's really gone into the health aspect 
is on the TV cooking show she was on, and even then she started off by 
talking about animal rights.  Example: 

*       Kate, how long have you been a vegetarian, all your life?
        No, I haven't.  It's about five years now. 
        And what made you decide in the first place? 
        Well, I think ever since I've been quite young I've always felt, not 
bad, but a bit guilty about eating meat because the fact that animals are 
killed and in a lot of cases in a very necessary way, you know, where it's a 
big exploitation of animals.  And one day I just had this feeling and tried 
to a bit of meat and this feeling - it was so raw that I just identified 
immediately with the fact that it was an animal.  That this thing was alive 
and it had been killed for me to eat it and I thought, "no, I'm not into 
this."  So I thought I'd become a vegetarian.  And I didn't have a clue, I 
had no idea what I could eat all I knew was that people didn't eat meat or 
fish.  And I used to eat a lot of chocolate, so I lived for the next week 
off chocolate and tea.  
        Well that's not very good...
        Well, no.  This is what I thought so eventually through meeting 
other friends that were vegetarians and books and things I managed to get a 
diet together.  And it's fantastic, because when I ate meat I wouldn't touch 
vegetables, I hated them.  But since I've become vegetarian I'll eat really 
only vegetables, you know.  So it's really broadened my diet.
