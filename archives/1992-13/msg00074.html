        Dick, if you could post that info on Brazil, I'd really appreciate 
it.  I haven't felt this frustated about "multiple versions" since I found 
out that The Beatle's albums had fewer songs on the American albums!  :-) 

        In _Be_Kind_To_My_Mistakes_, Kate sings: 

It is this that brings us together. 

        Does anyone have any ideas what "it" is?  Is she refering to the 
fact that they both make mistakes, or that they don't know each other, or 
what?  Like many Kate songs, I have trouble relating the "chorus" to the 
rest of the songs. 



        On Babooshka and grandmothers, Kate has this to say: 

*       "Babooshka", which was a surprisingly big hit after quite a slow 
start, it did take a little bit of time didn't?
        Yes, it did.  It was climbing up there quite slowly at the front, 
yes. 
        And the story behind "Babooshka" very quickly because everyone was 
saying it's Russian for grandmother, yes? 
        Yes, well apparently it is grandmother, it's also a headdress that 
people wear.  But when I wrote the song it was just a name that literally 
came into my mind, I've presumed I've got it from a fairy story I'd read 
when I was a child.  And after having written the song a series of 
incredible coincidences happened where I'd turned on the television and 
there was Donald Swan singing about Babooshka.  So I thought, "well, there's 
got to be someone who's actually called Babooshka."  So I was looking 
through Radio Times and there, another coincidence, there was an opera 
called Babooshka.  Apparently she was the lady that the three kings went to 
see because the star stopped over her house and they thought "Jesus is in 
there."  So they went in and he wasn't.  And they wouldn't let her come with 
them to find the baby and she spent the rest of her life looking for him and 
she never found him.  And also a friend of mine had a cat called Babooshka.  
[He laughs]  So these really extraordinary things that kept coming up when 
in fact it was just a name that came into my head at the time purely because 
it fitted.   (1980, Never For Ever Debut)
 

        I always like it somehow when she says "fitted".  :-)
