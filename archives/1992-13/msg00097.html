&gt;[me saying she is a cult figure and some people can't handle that]
&gt;
&gt;KaTe an obscure cult figure? Ha ha. KaTe is 'obscure' ONLY in the US. 

Maybe obscure is a bad word.  Let's just say that she's no Kylie. :)

&gt;In the UK she is a very popular artist, with lots of Top 10 singles,
&gt;and No 1 albums. Actually all over Europe. I remember the display of 
&gt;the tiniest record store in my neighborhood in Athens, Greece, being 
&gt;full of KaTe posters and promo stuff during the release of TKI, and 
&gt;most subsequent LPs. 

The Kick Inside was top-40 back then, fella.  Since then, her
popularity has been steadily on the wane, no matter how much we raving
Kate Bush maniacs HATE the thought.  Face it: most Americans only know
her for that utterly (IMHO) crappy Elton John song.

Keep in mind that Europe is tiny; France being the size of Texas and
all.  To say that she's "very popular" is silly; if you consider being
the object of ridicule and derision in the press as well as popular
belief that she's totally 'round the bend as "very popular" ,then OK;
she's very popular.  However, there are many MANY artists who chart
more consistently and more frequently that Kate.

I get the feeling that she's viewed there somewhat like, say, Devo is
here - been around a while, had some hits, kinda arty, a new album
shows up every once in a while and people go "oh yeah them", but
mostly they're considered totally whacko.

&gt;But even in the US. "Alternative Rock" radio stations play her songs
&gt;all the time, and she is popular and known enough to be used as a
&gt;standard for comparing other female artists to her by Rolling Stone,
&gt;and MTV.

I'm AMAZED if WFNX or WBCN or even WZBC or WMBR play her at ALL.
Occasionally WFNX will play _Running Up That Hill_. 

&gt;You want obscure cult figures, try Happy Rhodes.

No thanks, I had some last week and it gave me gas.  :)

I still have this tape of "Ecto" that managed to land with my person
when I visited Chris &amp; Vickie in Kansas City a few years ago, and to
date I have not listened to one inch of it.  I think it's my own
private protest.   (Watch me get flamed for ignoring her genius such a
blatant and horrible manner; really, how could I, for SHAME)  :)

************************************************************************
* Anyway, the point I was simply making was that people were reading a *
* LOT into the "secret message", and that I was hoping we WOULDN'T get *
* into the same flame war we've had so many times before.  Flame wars  *
* are only cool if it's new ground...                                  *
