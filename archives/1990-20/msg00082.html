Below is Loren Petrich's response to the Kate/Madonna thread.
I just sent her all the stuff that has appeared on .gaffa, as
she asked.

&gt;&gt; [on Kate Bush == Madonna???]
&gt; 
&gt; But to hear this comparison made... well... 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry, but I just can't hold it back...
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;FLAME ON&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; HOW DARE YOU SO MUCH AS MENTION MADONNA IN THE SAME *BREATH* AS 
&gt;KATE BUSH?!
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;FLAME OFF&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Whew. It feels so good to get that out of my system. Now let me 
&gt;try and be a bit more rational about the issue.

	Is it that horrible???

	Did I commit an unforgivable sin???

	I hope no Kate Bush fan is going to put a price on my head for
_this_. Or try to burn me at the stake.
 
&gt; Madonna is, first and foremost, a pop artist. Her major goals are
&gt;to become a legend in the public eye, an idol, an icon, a symbol
&gt;which evokes a universal image in the minds of anyone exposed to her.
&gt;She wants recognition. Oh yeah, and big bucks. 

	Who wouldn't want to be appreciated by the people around
oneself?

	And who wouldn't want a lot of money??? Would you like to try
living without money?

	And what's wrong with money? Are you a Communist? :-):-)

	And how is Kate Bush fundamentally different??

&gt;	[how Kate Bush's work is supposedly pure artistry and
&gt;	Madonna's work is supposedly crowd-pleasing -- how Kate Bush's
&gt;	work is an expression of herself and Madonna's isn't]

	Don't be too sure. Madonna also expresses herself in her work.

&gt; To sum up, I think Kate Bush's artistic style as opposed to 
&gt;Madonna's is analogous to a Van Gogh painting as opposed to 
&gt;the cover of "People" magazine. 

	How does that work out? I know that Madonna is sometimes
unsubtle, but...

&gt;My logic here may not be watertight, but I think you get the 
&gt;idea. It's actually a very emotional issue for me, and I think
&gt;a lot of Kate Bush fans feel the same way. If I had this sort
&gt;of reaction, I can't wait to see what some of the dyed-in-the-
&gt;wool Love-Hounds have to say when they get a hold of your 
&gt;article.

	By all means. You are certainly entitled to have it posted on
rec.music.gaffa.

	Tell me what they all think of it over there. I'd love to find
out what they think. I hope that they can come up with less flamey
responses than I have seen here.

&gt;... But please. When you 
&gt;make comparisons to Kate Bush, you're treading on sacred 
&gt;ground. Please take care to treat it with respect, or you 
&gt;may incur the wrath of those who worship there.

	So that's what it is all about. The biggest of the Kate Bush
fans is going to try to put a price on my head. Or else try to burn me
at the stake. I had hoped that I had been polite in my posting, but
when it comes down to this...

	If there is anything I would prefer, it is that you would try
to explain some of Kate Bush's artistry to all us people of
rec.music.misc -- including me.
