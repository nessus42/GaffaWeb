Well, here in the boonies, at the fringe of fm signals from Detroit,
Toledo and Lansing we are literally surrounded by top 40 "stuff."
I reconciled myself to not much of a celebration of a special someone's
32nd birthday.  Flipping the channels I hit MTV and aging hippie Martha
Quinn.  Lo and Behold, she mentioned said birthday and the "coincidence"
it's also Emily Bronte's birthday.  EB of course wrote Wuthering Heights,
Kate's first album.  Of course Mr. Gilmore played a part in that event,
just as he played some interesting licks in the video Marth chose to
play, Love &amp; Anger.  Martha tends to fall on the anger end of the spectrum,
and she did "walk on" the ending of the video, but it warmed my heart
to see it, which led  to this note.
 I read very few "recreational lists" this being one, the Greatful Dead
list is the other.  Besides fantasies of Kate signing with the Jerry Garcia
band (*Electric* folk writ large in some obscure corners of the mind) these
two lists are a study in contrast.  In one, an almost total dedication to
live concerts, touring and the like, and the current sense of loss over
the death of keyboardist Brent Mydland.  In the other, a virtual starvation
of her presence, yet a constant celebration as her creativity and work
continue to be shared with us. 
 We get the bitter and the sweet in this life.  So those who celebrated
last weekend and/or today, know how truly fortunate we are to have more to
look forward to from our sweet lady Kate.
And aside, congrats to Chris &amp; Vickie on the relocations.  It was one of
your set lists and discussions that caught my eye way back when I first
"sampled" this list.  My parents live in chicago and I hope I can meet you
two when I'm visiting.  Have you considered further syndication of your show?
I'd be glad to talk to the 5 public radio stations we have in the area...
 Best all.  Ken Latta, Merit Computer Network, NSFNET Project, klatta@merit.edu
