   Some folks told me that his guitar playing is reminiscent of Roxy
   Music -- that sound good.

Nelson's guitar work has gone through many styles, from a Blues/Rock based
sounds in his early days, through the guitar pyrotechnics of BeBop Deluxe and
experimentation with early guitar synths to being one of the masters of the
E-bow. In my opinion he's never played a bad note in his life, but I lost
touch with his output after the EP you're talking about....which is in my
record collection and I can't remember it's name!

   I have also seen an ep of his that included
   Mick Karn on bass -- a good sign.  Can anyone tell me what this ep is
   called, and which cd it would be on.

Karn only plays on one track on this ep, "Glowworld". Yukihiro Takahashi also
plays and programs drums on various tracks.

   Or, can somebody recommand another
   cd and describe it a bit.  

Well, both the EP you're talking about and the LP that preceded it (The Love
That Whirls) are substantially synth and drum-machine based, though unlike
most artists of the periob (1983-84 ish) Nelson plays the synth riffs himself
rather than using a sequencer. Your comment about Karn suggests you're into
Japan, in which case you might like these. Ambient music fans might also be
interested in "Sounding The Ritual Echo", an album of short instrumentals,
and "La Belle Et La Bete" and "Das Kabinet", which were done to accompany the
Yorkshire Actors Company's productions of "Beauty and The Beast" and "The
Cabinet of Doctor Caligari". 

And since I'm posting this on Her birthday, a reminder....she is....but we
all knew that anyway.
