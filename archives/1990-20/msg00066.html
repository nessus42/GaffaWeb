&gt; Simple.  It has nothing to do with the hypothesis.  You just haven't
&gt; listened to it enough to have been revelated yet.
&gt; Although most will agree that TD is KT's best, they will probably also agree
&gt; that it is the one that requires the most patience.  It wasn't until after
&gt; many, many listenings that I decided TD was great.  My first impression
&gt; (for many months) was exactly yours: yucko.

Mine too. It took me months to get into TD. Now I think it is the greatest
album ever. I have also been listening to TSW for months now. It still ranks
at the bottom of my list of Kate's work. It is a good piece of work, but it
just doesn't have that touch of magic I have come to associate with Kate's
work. 

&gt; If you can appreciate TD, I have found, there's a whole gamut of other
&gt; music out there (much of it mentioned in LH) that you are ready to
&gt; explore.  It really does open your mind and let the weirdness in.
&gt; Honest.  Really and truly.

I just wish Kate was producing more of the weirdness. Its not like she has lost
it completely, after all there's _Ken_.
