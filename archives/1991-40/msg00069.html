&gt;       Captain Kirk?  Captain Kirk? 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       Spock, is that you?
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       Indeed, it is Captain.  I am most pleased that I have been
&gt;able to establish contact with you. 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       Where are we, Spock?  Last thing I remember is that after
&gt;the incident on Calligar we were beaming down to a planet. 
&gt;Since then all I seem to be aware of is a series of bizarre text
&gt;messages floating through my consciousness. 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       I have been aware of these messages too, Captain, and it is
&gt;through that link that I have been able to establish contact. 
&gt;Apparently the Calligar rift left disturbances that we were not
&gt;aware of.  It appears that we have once again been sent back
&gt;through time and, rather then materializing in solid form, our
&gt;consciousness has been placed in the memory banks of a twentieth
&gt;century computer system.
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       Amazing, Spock.  Good thing McCoy isn't here.  What exactly
&gt;is this place? 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       I am not entirely sure, Captain.  We have been here for 93.2
&gt;hours and I have been using this time to examine the memory
&gt;systems of the network we are in.  It appears to be called, "The
&gt;Love Hounds Computer Network."  It appears to be dedicated to
&gt;Kate Bush, a contemporary singer and musician of some renown.  
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       This Kate Bush, she appears to be a God to these people. 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       That was my initial hypothesis, although I now believe that
&gt;most of the members of this system don't see her as a God, but
&gt;instead this appears to be a form of humour to these people,
&gt;though I am at a loss to explain it.  
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       Which you often see to be when it comes to humor, though I
&gt;must admit I can't explain it either.  This seems to be an awful
&gt;lot of reading material devoted to one singer. 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:    
&gt;       Indeed?  It never fails to amaze me how you humans often
&gt;tend to find in-depth discussion of issues related to the arts
&gt;distasteful, though I must admit that many of the issues
&gt;discussed on this network concern items of trivial interest. 
&gt;However I have found an interesting area of this system entitled
&gt;"The Love-Hounds Archives", which contains many interesting
&gt;photographs of the young woman as well as a fascinating document
&gt;entitled "Cloudbusting" which appears to be a historic
&gt;predesesor to the post-autobiographical format which became
&gt;popular in the early 21rst century.  Unfortunately Cloudbusting,
&gt;needless to say, contains only information up to the current
&gt;year, 1991, and so does not include information on Kate's 1993
&gt;album, Late Again, her 1996 album, For The Love Of Stern, or her
&gt;Tour Of Life II, which was held in 1998 and became the basis for
&gt;an entire civilization on planet Gaffan II.  Indeed, I am sure
&gt;that the inhabitants of that planet would be very interested in
&gt;the existence of this network as it may confirm their murky
&gt;historical record as to where their ancestors...[BREAK]

SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       Yes, Captain. 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       This is all very interesting but it's not going to help us
&gt;any.  Can you formulate a plan to remove us from the memory
banks of this computer system? 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       Indeed, Captain.  I have already been working on just such a
&gt;plan, of course.  I developed the idea while attempting to
&gt;formulate a link with you, and instead having been connected to
&gt;this time period's mass entertainment system, and to an 
&gt;entertainment program entitled "Quantum Leap."  
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       Are you sure it wasn't "Back To The Future II", Spock. 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       Quite certain, Captain.  Though the principle is remarkably
&gt;similar.  
&gt;       I believe that I can device a computer virus that will
&gt;travel from computer to computer, undetected, until a specific
&gt;stardate, when it will flash a message on the Enterprise's
&gt;computer screen, revealing the location of our minds inside
&gt;this computer.  The Enterprise should then be able to beam us
&gt;out, through the same time-portal that we were beamed in. 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       Are there any risks, Spock?
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       If the initial virus does not succeed, it is unlikely that
&gt;any further versions will.  In this case, the only option open
&gt;to us would be to simply wait in computer memory until after the
&gt;accident, transfering ourselves when needed, and then leave the
&gt;messages ourselves.  
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       And be trapped listening to these people for who knows how
&gt;long?  Please tell it will work, Spock.
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       I shall endeavor to do my best, Captain.  Although I enjoy
&gt;the above average intellectual level shown on this network, I
&gt;find this flagrant "flaming" most distasteful. 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;               Actually, Spock, I was going to say that I found the
&gt;insufferable intellectualism of this network "most distasteful."

SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       Indeed? 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:     
&gt;       Indeed.  Oh, no, Spock, I think I feel another wave of
messages coming across.  
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       According to these messages, this system has not been
&gt;working properly for the past several days.  Our presence here
&gt;appears to have disrupted the normal operation of this network
&gt;to a great degree.
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       Is there any danger that the management of this system will
&gt;discover the cause of the problem and attempt to delete it,
&gt;namely us? 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       Unlikely, Captain.  The management here appears to be lax to
&gt;the extreme.  In any case, I believe I have finished the
&gt;computer virus. 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       OH, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MAKE IT WORK SPOCK.  
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       Captain, we have been in stressful situations before, why
&gt;are you so emotional at this moment? 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       I just read another bunch of messages. 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       I see, Captain.   I am preparing to release the virus. 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       Will there be any record of our appearance here?  
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       There will be inactive copies of our consciousness here in
&gt;the memory banks, but at the rate these people type these should
&gt;be entirely destroyed in 89.3 days, far less if one Ron Hill
&gt;acquires any more interview material.  However, remnants of our
&gt;conversation may be left in the messaging system.  
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       I doubt we have said much that could effect the future
course of Earth.  
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       You are correct, Captain.  Also, it appears to be a custom
&gt;of these people to skip large threads of messages when they
&gt;don't know the source or understand the content.  
&gt;       While reviewing the messages of the last five years, I have
&gt;noticed a fascinating discrepancy.  The people here appear to be
&gt;aware of many things that people in the 20th century should not. 
&gt;I have seen the names "Klingons" and "Romulans" used as well as
&gt;other things from our century.  Most puzzling they appear to
&gt;possess information which, if true, refers to the century AFTER
&gt;ours. 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       Thats incredible, Spock!
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       Indeed.  I can offer no explanation, Captain.  
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       Perhaps Starfleet will authorize another mission back here,
&gt;though I would insist that we be sent in human form, rather then
&gt;as computer memory. 
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       That would be preferable.  Well the computer virus is
&gt;finished.  I will release it now.  
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Kirk) writes:
&gt;       Thank you, Mr. Spock.  We shall have to play some of this
&gt;Kate Bush's music when we're back on the Enterprise.  
 
SYSTEM&gt;????@????.com (Spock) writes:
&gt;       Indeed we shall, Captain.
