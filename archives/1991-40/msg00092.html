mjm (of the shrinking mailbox) commented that he was surprised that no one
covered EJ/BT's "Empty Garden."

I agree that this is one of their best songs; probably my second favorite
after "Rocketman".

I'm not so sure that nobody covered it for _Two Rooms_.  When I saw the
accompanying videocassette in Tower a week or two ago, I fairly clearly
remember seeing "Empty Garden" listed on it.  I have no idea who did
the cover (or if, in fact, it's just the original video for the song with
Elton John performing it).

Now, assuming that I *did* see it listed on the video compilation, and
assuming that it's a cover, I don't have the slightest idea why it's not on
the _Two Rooms_ CD.  (or, for that matter, why not all of the artists made
videos (including KaTe))

&lt;sigh&gt;  I really want to hear that song now.  It's been years and years since
I've heard it.  

obKaTe:  I _still_ haven't heard "Rocketman."  The only station in town 
that's playing it is WHFS, and I have friends who have heard it there
multiple times already.  The closest I've come was the day I got in my car,
turned on my radio, listened to the end of the song that was playing, and
then heard that DJ say, "That was such-n-such by so-n-so.  Before that, we
heard Kate Bush singing her version of Elton John's 'Rocketman.'"

I may just need to go buy the bloody CD if I'm ever going to get to hear it.

Jeff
