Vickie here.    (Entering IMHOland, please obey speed limits)

 Loren says:

&gt; vickie sez:
|I believe that she and John Switzer broke up as a couple during the
|making of this album.

&gt; Thanks for the confirmation here, John Switzer was a co-producer of the
&gt; album. This puts an interesting twist on things.

A documentary on Jane exists which was partially filmed during the
recording of TW. One scene shows Jane with John sitting right behind
her. The focus is on Jane, but if you tear your eyes away and look at
John, you can see that he's looking at her with the most loving expression
I've ever seen on anyone's face. Knowing that they broke up sometime 
shortly after this, well, I cry now everytime I see this scene.

&gt; I find people who don't/can't like her music. This frustrates me, as her
&gt; music makes me feel such intensity that I wish others to feel this way.

I know how you feel.

&gt; Apparently not all people can feel this. And that's too bad.

I agree, but things like this shouldn't be said out loud. Not here in
rec.music.gaffa anyway. Hopefully, none of the people who take offense
at this sort of thing are reading this post. We'll see, I suppose. I'll
have to dig up my post on "magic" and send it to you. 

|A couple of other quick interpretations...we believe that "Lena Is A White
|Table" is about an autistic child. There are 4 characters in the song. Two
|sisters, talking about a third (Lena), to the forth, who's never heard from.

&gt; that can work, I think. My favorite parts in this song are the
&gt; interruptions of the 2 sisters. it really takes a good reading to
&gt; understand these, but the sense of conversation is so real.

"First you go up the hill" ("Don't forget to say the church") "The church,
why?" ("In case they miss the turn") "Let me do the talking" ("You make
mistakes sometimes") "Well so do you" ("_Never_ let me talk") "Yaaa drink
your beer" ("This is no suprise")

Brilliant!

&gt; the laundry line theme is so mystical. 'nobody knows how far it goes'.

I think one of the sisters has had too many beers by this point :-)
("...probably past the edge of the earth maybe") "Oh come ON"

&gt;'Goodbye': I have to say, that I knew the feeling in this song long
&gt; before I knew the words. It's one of my favorites.

Yes, I liked what you said. The wail at the end always sends shivers
up my spine.

|"The White Tent The Raft" is (again, we believe) about Jane's grandparents.

&gt; I have to disagree here, but I also have to say that I haven't studied the
&gt; song as intently as I should. 
&gt; this is a very deep, difficult song, and many readings are in order.

Maybe no one will *ever* know what this song is really about. 

|Of course, all this is IMHO. She isn't for everyone, and it even took me
|about a year to realize her brilliance.

&gt; my *first* listen (it was 'the lobby') did it for me. What I find difficult
&gt; is that other people can't enjoy her. It reminds me of the people who shun
&gt; Kate because she sounds 'weird'. Give it some thought!, people! there's
&gt; more to listening than meets the ear.

How long have you been hanging around rec.music.gaffa? Just curious if
you were around during the "Happy Wars" Spring 1991.

|She's a very beautiful person, inside and out. I was lucky enough to see
|her in concert last year and was able to meet her after the show.

&gt; I envy you, intensely. not only for meeting 'raspberry sue-jane', (a silly 
&gt; nickname, I have given, in one of my poems), but for Peter Gabriel, as well
&gt; (with genesis, of course).

Thanks. I got into Jane in 1984, and finally saw (&amp; met) her in 1990.
PG &amp; Genesis together is an impossible dream now, but you still have
plenty of time for Jane. Chin up!

&gt;&gt;&gt; To have the ability to move other people in such an intrusive way is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; gift.

|Thank you for your post, Loren. I couldn't agree more.

&gt; thank you. maybe we should talk!

Do you know about the Jane Siberry mailing list?

Did you know that Karen and Don of The Innocence Mission are HUGE Jane
fans? Jenn pointed out that Karen even used Jane's line "flap and fly"
in...uh...my mind's a blank, one of the songs on the new IM album. I
think it's "And Hiding Away" but I'm too lazy to go look.

Glad to meet you! Say, have you heard of Happy Rhodes? :-)
