Just picking up some really old threads...

Someone, (Ron Hill?) said last week that they saw _Two_Rooms_ at Price Club.

Well, back in late December, I saw THE BOXED SET, TWW !!! At Club Price!! It
was going for 99$CAN or about 85-90$US. And that was before taxes had gone
from 9% to 15.56% (combined provincial and GST)!

Back then, I had just became interested in KaTe, owning only TWS on cassette.
When I saw the boxed set, I was interested, but I had no CD player. Within
weeks, it was gone, and I haven't seen one there since. I bought a CD player
this summer (from Club Price) and bought the boxed set for 140$ (grrrh plus
tax, slightly used) from a record store. I haven't seen any box sets in stores
since. (Well, they have it on cassettes)

It seems that _Live_at_Hammersmith_, _TSW:_The_Videos_ and TSF have all been
rereleased in Canada this year on videotape. I bought mine during the summer
and they all say 1991 on them. On _Live.._ I noticed that the video quality
was pretty bad when compared to the clips of it on TSW and TWS. They must have
used an old circa 1980 duplicating master. Sigh...

I want my HDTV!!!  :-)

The Rolling Stones have a concert film out in IMAX theatres now.
How about The Ninth Wave, on IMAX!
KaTe, 5 stories high! :)

I'm sure there were other things I wanted to comment on, but I don't have
copies of old gaffas with me. Oh well...
