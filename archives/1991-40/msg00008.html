&gt;Vickie sez:
&gt;&gt;It's very fashionable to be cynical and anti-hero nowadays I guess.

Yes, it is fashionable to be cynical.  It has been for a long time.
This is an observation, not a judgement.

&gt;While I still
&gt;have an ounce of strength in my fingers, I will fight to allow the most
&gt;unpopular and nasty messages to be posted!
&gt;The dark side is what never
&gt;gets probed (hence it being the DARK side... no light shines upon it).
&gt;
&gt;Someone has to dare to question, to criticize.
&gt;I still get plenty of email saying things like, "thanks for saying what I
&gt;didn't have the guts to."

Gosh, just like Indy Jones-- daa-d-d-DAAA, daa-d-DAA.  Or like Howard Roark.
I get the tinglies just THINKIN' about people like that.  I only wish I
could BE one, *sigh*.  I guess that's what a makes a REAL man. ;-)

&gt;to stop posting your "emotional writings."  You just have to expect that
&gt;we're going to continue to pick them apart and ridicule you for being
&gt;incapable of critical thought, led around by your heart rather than your
&gt;brain.

Yes, the rational mind is the ONLY thing that should direct what we do.  Our
system of logic is infallible and efficient, and the only thing that has
advanced humankind this far.

I think that we should make an official policy here at r.m.g to actively
ridicule ANYBODY who posts emotional writings.  Emotions of other people are
such fun to pick apart, and it would be a shame to waste the opportunity.
It's just silly to feel open, trusting, or sensitive where Kate Bush is 
concerned.  Gestalt therapy is the only real solution here.

&gt;I personally feel no need to discourage emotion.  I don't even know what you
&gt;mean by that phrase, actually, because all my favorite states of being (hate,
&gt;fear, depression, despair and misery) are classified as "emotions."  At
&gt;least, they were last time I checked.  I think you mean Sweetness And Light
&gt;emotions.

Wow, great minds think alike.  Those are MY favorite states of being, too!
Now I need to take back what I said before about emotions.  If we're talking
about these emotions, I want to raise them to the highest mountaintop, just
to prove that they exist.  Yummy.

&gt;&gt;No, I'll most likely never write another emotion-laden article for this
&gt;&gt;newsgroup, so the emotion-stompers won't have anything to tear apart. 
&gt;
&gt;Well, that would certainly solve the problem.  Or you could just post it and
&gt;say at the bottom, "this is a purely personal viewpoint.  all followups will
&gt;be cheerfully ignored."  Maybe your skin isn't thick enough.  I know better
&gt;than to take anything that anyone says about me seriously.  (Unless it is
&gt;fulsome in praise, of course).

I don't take anything people say about me seriously, either.  Safest
policy.  After all, nobody knows me as well as I do, which implies that
nobody knows anything about me I don't already know, so I can (and should)
just cheerfully ignore them.

&gt;am vindicated, because poor old Cynthia has been trounced.  Yes, she was a
&gt;bit rude and inconsiderate, but we all have our off days.

OK, for you freshman netters:  Don't Post When You Have an Off Day.
This was communicated to me more than once, when I first started reading
and posting news.  Are there ways onto the net that avoid these warnings?

&gt;I remember the
&gt;glory days of love-hounds when rudeness was the order of the day.  I
&gt;strongly urge you to go read the old archives - files 0005 through 0020, I
&gt;think, are particularly telling.  I can never hope to match the spitefulness
&gt;or pure evil tone achieved by Messrs Wicinski, Hoffman and Earle.  Even IED
&gt;was a vicious person in those days.  I often miss those heady days.  One
&gt;slip and you were dead meat.

Oh boy, sounds like a real party!  Spite and evil are things I've also
decided to further in my existence.  That decision came after long
experience in both the sweetness/light school and the spite/evil/dark cult.
And given the full experience of both, the choice is obvious, don't you
agree?

&gt;I wouldn't ask him to change the way he acts.  If you can't take his 
&gt;punishing style, put him in your kill file.

Mmm, that's my goal too, to be able to take maximum punishment!  I think
everybody should be as tough as they can be, number one priority.  It's a
tough world out there, and we need to teach all you gaffa-ites how to
survive it.  There's a war on, of ideas!

&gt;[something like...] Rec.music.gaffa's a rough-and-tumble forum for those
&gt;with the stomach to take it. [etc-- fuggin' flakey vi editor]

Right on!  We all need stronger stomachs (see last paragraph).  And all the
other body parts mentioned here, skin, hearts, whatever.
