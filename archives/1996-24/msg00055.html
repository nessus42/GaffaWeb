&gt;Hi fellow Kate fanatics! :)
&gt;I don't know if this is customary around here, but I have recently
&gt;subscribed to the list and thought I'd introduce myself. I promise I won't
&gt;write my autobiography :) even though I was born a blabber-mouth and always
&gt;will be!

&gt;So here goes:
&gt;My name is Carra (well, Carina to be honest, but noone calls me that), and
&gt;I live in Umea in the north part of Sweden. I'm 31 and I'm a research
&gt;student in comparative literature. Movies, literature, art, music, my
&gt;darling monster (as in cat) Aramis, hanging out with friends at a nice pub
&gt;(drinking too much beer and smoke too many cigarettes :) )... now these are
&gt;a few of my favourite things!

&gt;I've been a fan of Kate Bush for several years now. She's become a "sister"
&gt;to me in some sense, I feel attached to her, seek inspiration and comfort
&gt;in her music and lyrics. A very important person in my life, that I could
&gt;not do without! And yet I fail every time I try to figure out exactly
&gt;*what* intrigues me so about her. There seem to be a different Kate for
&gt;every occasion, when I reach out for her, depending on my mood... Yes, I
&gt;know, woolly... but true to me.

&gt;The first song I heard was Wuthering Heights (which made me read the book,
&gt;which I didn't like by the time being, I was only 16, but now it's one of
&gt;my favourites for many reasons!) I'm ashamed to admit that it was only
&gt;later that I became really obsessed with her (even if I liked the songs I
&gt;heard on the radio) and started to collect her albums. Maybe I needed the
&gt;time, I don't know. It's hard to pick a favourite song, but This Woman's
&gt;Work will always be very, very special to me. And so is Song of Solomon!
&gt;Ah, now I'm close to start rambling... sorry...

&gt;I was happy to find out about this list, and although I will probably not
&gt;have much to contribute with, regarding my lack of the knowledge that seem
&gt;to be the spirit here (I really don't know that much about Kate) I will
&gt;enjoy for sure to be here!

&gt;I fear that this was a horribly blurred letter... but don't say I didn't
&gt;warn you! And so I've kept you long enough! (If you made it this far)

&gt;Love, Carra

&gt;"You had a temper like my jealousy
&gt;too hot too greedy"
&gt;(Wuthering Heights, now those lines are significant for the novel IMHO! I
&gt;have never read it as a banal, conventional love story)

Talk away in my opinion talking to people you might never had is the
true benefit of this game not enough people do it,get in touch
