The problems that I have with it, however, don't have much to do with the
music.  First, Kate doesn't get anything ($$$) for this (and I believe she
doesn't like the idea of having this material out there)  Second, the sound
quality (at least on my CD) leaves something to be desired.  Basically, it
sounds like the songs have gone to the moon and back, via tape, LP, tape
again, and then CD.

Hi Ron  (hmmmmm....like writing to myself  ;-) )

   This is why I think the people who already own the Kate Demos should tape
them free
of charge to anybody asking.  This will undermind the bootlegging industry.   I
myself
have made several copies of the Kate demos and I'll continue to do so.  If
anybody wants
a the home demos,  drop me a line.    

   As far as the sound quality is concerned,  you can't expect much.  Most of
these songs
were perhaps recorded on a small portable cassette deck with 1 microphone. 
Then these
recordings were probably copied and re-copied....put onto vinyl.....put back
onto tape...
..then finally transferred onto CDs.   Of course they sound terrible.  

   Although these songs aren't the best songs Kate has ever recorded, they are
interesting
in the sense that we're able to get a glimpse at a very young Kate making her
first baby
steps at composing.  This alone makes these recordings worth the listen.
     

peace

ron
