Scott sez...
&gt;I think this one was released last year sometime (summer/autumn
&gt;maybe). I've never actually seen it yet. It's not a 3" CD, is it?
&gt;(There's and ad for a 3" interview CD in this month's Record
&gt;Collector, but it doesn't say any more about it!)

Hi Scott!

    No, it's a normal size CD. KT talks a lenght about the meaning and feelings
behind various songs on NFE. They also touch on things like the "Princess of
Suburbia" (she thought it was terrible) how much help the support of her family
has been and the pressure of the music industry.

Chris sez...
&gt;&gt;From: "S.Ward-Smith" &lt;pcxsws@unicorn.nott.ac.uk&gt;
&gt;&gt;Another point- Any other Miranda Sex Garden fans out there.
&gt;&gt;They will definitely appeal to readers of this group.
&gt;
&gt;Well, there's at least *one* Miranda Sex Garden fan out here. Any
&gt;others yet? If there are, what do you think of their different
&gt;material? I first got the _Gush_Forth_my_Tears_ CD single with the
&gt;"dance" remixes, which I really love. Then I got _Madra_, and I like
&gt;that a lot too. I don't have _Iris_ yet; can anyone tell me what it's
&gt;like?

Hi Chris!!

    Yep, I'm another Miranda Sex Garden fan. I only new them from the few
video's I ever got to see of them on light night Rage (a music video program
here in Oz). I've always loved _Gush_Forth_my_Tears_, now you say there's a CD
single that I missed! Please give me info on it so I can try and chase it up.
As for what CD's I do have. Well I seached for ages and found -nothing- until
Iris turned up. That was my sole MSG (sounds like a food additive ;-) CD I
owned for months (nice CD too, get it if you can). Then about Novemeber last
year my sister found Madra (?? I think that's its name I can't really remember
it at the moment) and bought it for me !! :-) It was lovely BUT be warned the
differences between these two CD's are GREAT. Madra is solely beautiful
harmonies in a kind of a-cappella style while Iris has those voices hidden in
back of some, at times, loud musical accompaniment.
