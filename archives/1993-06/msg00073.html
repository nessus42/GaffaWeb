        (I posted a message like this yesterday, but I don't think it 
made it out of san Diego). 

        This new Never For Ever boot sounds exciting.  By the 
descriptions posted here, it would be the only time Kate has commented 
directly on the crummy Fred V. books on her.  It's very rare that 
interview boots (or any boots) nowadays contain any new material.
        I am going to see Andrew Marvick next month and he says he has 
it so look for a transcription at the end of next month (I'll be in San 
Fransico for a week, or else I'd transcribe it before then)&gt; 
        Also, it looks like I may be getting some more interviews 
before then.  Tracy Robin (formerly of Still Breathing/Breakthough 
fanzines) has promiced to send me a bunch of stuff, including Kate's 
first ever radio interview!  Should be interesting.  This'll be the 
first time in a long time that I've been promiced something and 
actually gottin it!  (It's been a disappointing year, KT 
Interview-wise).  

        Following is a quote and an old message about Astrology (which 
I don't personally belive in myself, but to each his own. 

m8011;3


        Do you believe in astrology? 
        Um, I think there's a lot in astrology.  I think it's a very 
ancient, well mathatically planned out thing that a lot of people 
boo-hoo.  And I think it's very unfair, because there's a lot of very 
strong, scientific knowledge in there.  I think it's been 
commercialized a lot, which is why people become so cynical.  But I 
think the fact that people are born at a certain time, on a certain 
day, with stars in certain position is bound to to have some effect on 
that person because we are ruled by everything around us. 
        So, every morning when your morning paper comes you grab it and 
sorta leap through to your horoscope and see what your days going to be 
like? 
        Oh, no.  I don't believe those, I think they're rubbish.  
They're just someone who's made a generalized, commercial thing for the 
people to entertain themselves with.  I think real astrology, there is 
something in it, yeah.   (1979, Personal Call)

Chris here, 
 
    A co-worker of Vickie's handed the following to Vickie today.  
 
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
--------- 
 
    Amy DeFalco of Hoffman Estates, Illinois asks for another intriging 

British singer and provides data for her: Kate Bush, who was born on 
July 
30th, 1958, with Aries rising. We've mentioned Kate briefly in a 
previous 
column in connection with Peter Gabriel (February 13, 1950), because 
together 
they did one of the most beautiful videos I have ever seen, _Don't Give 
Up_. 
Amy asked for a chart comparison between the two. 
    Kate's chart is a fascinating mixture of tough and tender, starry 
and 
down to earth. Her Leo Sun conjunct Uranus is probably located in her 
Fifth 
House (I don't have the time of her birth, just the Ascendent). The 
Fifth 
rules loves and childern, but also show business, so she'll have an 
unusual 
(Uranus) show business (Leo) career. An elevated Aquarius Moon means 
not only 
a curious, adventurous outlook and a need for independence, but 
eventual 
American success, since our natal Moon is also in Aquarius. Setting the 
seal 
on that possibility is her Cancer Venus (love), in the sign of 
America's Sun, 
Mercury, Venus and Jupiter. She may even like it here so much that 
she'll 
live here a while or have a second home here. Mercury conjunct Pluto 
(depth) 
in serious Virgo means that her music is adult and she takes it with 
the 
utmost seriousness. But Pluto takes a long time to build, so her major 
success will not come quickly. Yet since Pluto is also permanence, she 
won't 
be a flash in the pan either. Unlike many performers she has both the 
style 
(Leo Sun-Uranus) and the substance (Virgo Mercury-Pluto). 
    She also has five fixed, stubborn planets that definitely form a 
T-square 
and, depending on the degree of the Moon, may even form a Grand Cross. 
These 
are difficult aspects indicating frustration, delays and obstacles. But 
fixed 
sign people not only do things slowly, they do them in their own way. 
When 
she hits it big she'll have done it without compromise and thus without 

regret. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 
 
    If you're into collecting Kate magazine mentions, we'd advise you 
to 
don your Heavy People hat'n'trenchcoat, dark glasses would be in order, 

and you might want to think about a fake mustache to go get the 
magazine 
"in question." 
 
   The magazine is the April issue of "ASTROLOGY - Your Daily 
Horoscope" 
available at fine supermarket check-outs from coast to coast. The above 
is 
on page 46, in the "Star Cycle for Celebrities in the News" section. 
   This must rank as one of the least likely places Kate has been 
mentioned, 
almost on a par with the very nice bit in the semi-sleezy "men's 
magazine" 
"Genesis". 
 
   Note: Neither Vickie or myself believe in astrology. We offer the 
above 
in the sprit of fun. If you believe in it, fine. We find it hilarious. 
 
BTW, we don't know Amy DeFalco. 
There's a bit more comparing Kate and Peter Gabriel.
