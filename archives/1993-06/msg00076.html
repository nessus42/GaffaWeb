Thanks to everyone with Miranda Sex Garden info, I got my questions
answered. (Although I found some new ones to ask.) Some responses:

&gt;    Yep, I'm another Miranda Sex Garden fan. I only new them from the few
&gt;video's I ever got to see of them on light night Rage (a music video program

Your TV will actually *play* good stuff like MSG? Wow... eMpTyV totally let me
down on this score, even 120 Minutes. (what *was* I thinking?)

&gt;here in Oz). I've always loved _Gush_Forth_my_Tears_, now you say there's a CD
&gt;single that I missed! Please give me info on it so I can try and chase it up.

Well, I have the US version CD single here. I don't know which #'s matter,
so I'll go overboard. On the disc it says (p) 1991 Mute Records Ltd.,
66497-2. It also says "Made in USA by WEA manufacturing" and "A Time
Warner company...". Maybe WEA does US distribution of Mute material, like
4AD and reprise.  On the case the disc # is 9 66497-2, I guess they had a
buncha spare 9's that day.  By way of comparison, the liner notes say that
_Madra_ is # 61126. Good luck.

&gt;As for what CD's I do have. Well I seached for ages and found -nothing- until
&gt;Iris turned up. That was my sole MSG (sounds like a food additive ;-) CD I
&gt;owned for months (nice CD too, get it if you can). Then about Novemeber last
&gt;year my sister found Madra (?? I think that's its name I can't really remember
&gt;it at the moment) and bought it for me !! :-) It was lovely BUT be warned the
&gt;differences between these two CD's are GREAT. Madra is solely beautiful
&gt;harmonies in a kind of a-cappella style while Iris has those voices hidden in
&gt;back of some, at times, loud musical accompaniment.


Many thanks to Graham and Shaun (comments below) for the mini-reviews and
the warnings; I do like _Madra_, but I was kind of hoping they'd add some
instruments (only a few) in there. Maybe they added too many, but I have
enough info to risk the $$$ now.

&gt;I found the Iris EP very disappointing.  The inclusion of a couple of
&gt;instruments made it sound more like a second rate Steeleye Span than
&gt;anything in the IMHO more interesting Dead Can Dance vein that they had
&gt;hitherto been exploring.

&gt;But we are all subject to mood swings.


Some further excitement:

&gt;I like the dance remix of Gush better than the album version, but then,
&gt;I can only take acapella madrigals in very small doses (note: that does

I feel likewise about madrigals. I like 'em, but too much is too much.
Which makes me wonder a bit. With other music I like, 2-4 nonstop hours is
no problem.  Why is it that only madrigals get tiresome? Any clues?

&gt;not mean I don't like Madra, it's just that I'm rarely in the mood to
&gt;listen to it for pleasure.) I have Iris, but I just haven't had a chance
&gt;to listen to it properly yet.

&gt;The video to Gush Forth my Tears is *lovely*. It's the dance remix

Actually, the way I got intro'ed to MSG was 15 seconds of the video
(that's all they played) on 120 Minutes. My ears said: (1) Get your
wallet. (2) Go to Tower Records *right now*. (3) Purchase. I complied, and
lived happily ever after.
And now I wonder, is the video available anywhere?

&gt;too, which is nice. I'm looking forward to the next album, which is
&gt;supposed to be more like the remix than Madra.

Is there another album on the way? (After _Iris_?) Would be nice...

Anyway, thanks to all for the overwhelming &amp;&amp; informative responses.

  Chris Conlon
