                                    ickie here. Everybody send their leftover fruitcake to MTV or CBS, OK?

&gt;&gt;Vickie here. I thought that some of the more irreverent among you
&gt;&gt;might get a kick out of my Christmas show. First, a word of
&gt;&gt;explanation for this show. Since "they" say that Christmas is
&gt;&gt;supposed to be a "religious" holiday, I decided to have a
&gt;&gt;"religious" show. (Yuk,yuk!)

Jon Drukman replies:
&gt;OK, good stuff...

Thanks for the compliment. Sincerely.

&gt;...but how come you didn't play "Christmas With The Devil" by
&gt;Spinal Tap?!

You're an intelligent kind of guy, read down the left side of the 
playlist and connect the dots.

    WARNING!! YET ANOTHER SUSPENDED IN GAFFA PLAYLIST COMING UP!!

This was last night's year/decade end 'god-I-hate-"Best Of"-lists' show.
"Best Of" lists only reflect two things; Sales/Popularity or
Personal Opinion of the person writing up the list. Take Rolling
Stone (please), how can anybody take seriously a list that excludes
Kate or Jane? Obviously, people who've never heard of Kate or Jane!
On tonight's show I was very honest in calling it "*My* Personal
Favorite *ARTISTS* of the 80s"(female-wise, of course.)
These are artists who are consistent. Everything they do is great (IMHO).
I would reccommend ANY album by all of these artists (of course,
some of the artists only have 1 album.) I could have played just
about any song from any of these artist's albums. The songs played
have no significance. I picked them at ramdom, something I could
only do on THIS particular show.

   This was by no means a complete list. There were many artists/groups I
just didn't have time to play.  For instance, Mary Coughlin, Caterwaul,
Danielle Dax, Enya, Beautiful Pea Green Boat (wattastupidnamegreat
bandthough), &amp; A.C. Marias, just to name a few.
   Next week I'll be playing "Brilliant Songs From Albums That Suck".


 ***For the second week in a row MTV did not have their Top 10 countdown
    I'd rather know if Kate's still at #1 than see some dumb New Year's
    Eve party.  Chris saw a new MTV promotional "Modern Music"-type ad
    which shows scenes from L&amp;A.

   Hell, might as well add all the best interviews too, edited in
