Chris'n'Vickie here. Hold off on sending those fruitcakes to Empty-vee.
This just appeared on MTV "News At Night" as the last feature at 11:55 CST. 

Female Voice: Unknown woman.
Male Voice: Tim Sommer (of Post-Modern MTV &amp; Hugo Largo)
Host: John Norris (sitting in for Kurt Loder)

********************************************************************************

Host: Long before it became trendy for big stars to take two or three years
between albums, England's mysterious Kate Bush was keeping a low profile
and laboring over her work. In fact in twelve years Bush has released only six
LPs. She went the entire nineteen-eighties without going on tour and she doesn't
have any plans to go on the road right now. But she does have a new album in
stores titled "The Sensual World", and we recently sat down with Kate for a look
inside her own rather illusive and ethereal world.

{Music: "Love and Anger"}
{Visual: Video of "Love and Anger" (Kate moving backwards into the blue light)}

Female Voice: Ah, the mysterious Kate Bush. Tell me something about her.

   {Visual: Very heavily processed tight shot of Kate's face. Solarised.}


Male Voice: Well since late nineteen-seventies she's put out a record about
once every two years, and she's just released a new album "The Sensual World".

    {Visual: shot of "The Sensual World" album cover zooms in.}

Male Voice: She's got a spectacular voice, she make really dramatic videos,
but she never tours.

  {Visual: Posterized shot of Kate looking back behind her chair. This remains
  as background...}

Kate: So that's the way I am, I guess.

   {Visual: Small box with Kate in it, floats dowm left side, during the above}

Female Voice: She toured once didn't she? 

Male Voice: Yeah, way back in ninteen-seventy-eight but she never toured again.

   {Visual: "Love and Anger" dancing with band. Crossfades to "Wuthering 
        Heights"}

Male Voice: You see she sort of exists only as this magical character you see
in videos and hear on records.

Kate: And again that's a very subjective.....opinion.

  {Visual: First full-screen, head-and-shoulders shot, of Kate. She is wearing
   a dark grey blouse and the "Love and Anger" earrings. She is wearing a very
   small necklace. Her name is keyed over at bottom of screen. She looks to her 
   upper left, searching, before saying "opinion".}

Female Voice: But you talked to her didn't you?

  {Visual: When Kate isn't talking, it is either shots from "Love and Anger"
   or processed two-tone, yellow and brown, loose footage.} 

Male Voice: Yeah, and she's very guarded.

Female Voice: Guarded?

Male Voice: Yeah. Guarded.

Kate: I wanted my work to speak. Not me as a person. Because I feel that's what
I want to give to the world..is..is the work that I do, not really me, or what I
have to say.

Female Voice: What did she say about this never touring thing?

     {Visual: "Love and Anger" video. Kate throws glitter}

Kate: After the last tour, which was a long time ago, I just felt very 
vulnerable. I'd been through tremendous public exposure, at a young age, and
um..I hadn't really stopped since it had started. And I think, really, over 
these years of being in the studio and being quite reculisve in some ways,
I've gained a lot of my strength back, that I did lose. And that's very 
important for me to keep my creative energies intact.
 {Visual: dissolve to cover edit}
And I think in many ways, retreating like I have, has helped me to be taken
more seriously as an artist, and um.., (purses her lips...lip smacking noise), 
that's good for me because that's what I've wanted, I've wanted to sort of
quietly get on with my work.

   {Visual: "Love and Anger" spins in with Kate standing there with orb and
    septre in front of ballet dancers.}
   {Music: "Love and Anger"(gets louder and then drops when Male Voice speaks}

Male Voice: She definitely wants her videos and records to be this magical
place. Can I tell you something weird? 

Female Voice: Yeah?

Male Voice: Well. During the whole interview, I was really distracted by this
yellow-green aura that was surrounding her body. I'm _completely_ serious.

    {Visual: Processed shot of Kate. Her face is in the clear but she is 
     surrounded by a reddish color. Dissolves to normal shot when she starts
     speaking.}

Kate: I think there's an awful lot of uh..sympathetic..magic almost, that goes
on in art. Where people do want to be..something other than what they are.
    {Visual: Video from "The Man With The Child In His Eyes" with audio 
     from "Wuthering Heights"}
More and more I think, this is, kind of, the special thing about music, that
it's not to do with *language*, 
    {Visual: Back to normal video}
that is connected with words, it's to do with,almost a sort of..subconsious
language, that people understand, that sounds can create feelings in other
people, um..you can actually say something to someone without words by using
shapes of sounds,.. and it seems like a totally facinating thing to me, and,
uh, I mean music is just so.....(phuhh..breath expelling noise, much like the
ships in "Astroids") It's mind boggling isn't it? Don't you think?

Host: And how Kate. Kate Bush. Her new album is "The Sensual World".

********************************************************************************

Well it's about time, isn't it? There should be more of this interview to come
on "Post-Modern MTV" and "120 Minutes" and "MTV Music News". We will, of course,
be suffering through hours of horrific, sexist, stupid videos to get these 
little pieces of Kate interviews. Pity us.

                                   Chris (who typed) 'n' Vickie (who taped)
