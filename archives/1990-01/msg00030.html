You all know that our very own Larry Deluca is a budding musical
superstar just waiting for the right break, right?  Well, he took one
giant leap forward in his bid to be the male Kate Bush of the 90's
last night at Jamaica Plain's famous Green Street Station.  (A real
gig!  At a real dive...  er, club!  With real beer!) On a stage the
size of a postage stamp, he managed to put on his very own Tour Of
Life kind of deal, with music and costume changes and slides and a
little drama and dance. 

The high point was, of course, when he came out from behind the screen
wearing a Kate style fedora and trench coat affair (like Them Heavy
People from the Tour Of Life), replete with wireless mic even, and
launched into a stunning live rendition of Hounds Of Love.  Here's
what it looked like: with the stage in total blackness, the strings
started chugging, like in the 12" mix, then the backup singers came
out, with flashlights in each hand, and shook them to the opening drum
beats.  Then Larry came out in the aforementioned costume and started
belting out them lyrics, while the backup singers crooned "dooby doo
doo, dooby doo dah" and yelped like proper little puppies.  Larry
mimed a few Kate-like moves with his fedora, like the little
side-to-side twitch that Kate gives in the promo video for Them Heavy
People (Larry even remembered that goofy little smirk too.) Since he
was doing the 12" version, there was a breakdown in the middle with
just the strings again, and the stage went back to black for a reprise
of the hand-held flashlight trick.  At the closing drawn-out string
sigh, Larry threw his fedora off to the side. 

A fine job, except that the strings didn't grind and chug enough
during the choruses.

So, you all owe it to yourselves to come to Boston and check out
Larry's show before he puts it in mothballs, never to be seen again
(except on the Keef MacMillan video, of course)...  So, Larry, when's
Tour Of Larry II?
