I tend to agree with this view when the orb and scepter are placed 
into the context of the video.  When considering them in the context
of the song, however, I just assumed they represented what I had always
understood them to represent - the king's authority (scepter) balanced by 
his his responsibility to justice (orb).   I saw these as corresponding
to the theme of the song, "Love and Anger", two forces that conflict and
balance one another.

&gt;&gt; was more than a little disappointed since I wasn't aware that a "Rock

&gt; 
&gt; We caught this and were supprised that they only showed two videos ourselves.
&gt; In the past we've found the best time to catch rare Kate videos on Empty-Vee
&gt; is during the guest VJ spots. Nick Rhodes and Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran

Thanks for the tip.  I guess I'll have to pay closer attention to these
spots!

&gt;&gt;(Hey does anyone have Kate images in something besides Sun raster format?)

&gt; plowing through hundreds of tapes). About raster files of Kate: I have a 
&gt; color scanner that produces Targa format files at 32 bits and I can convert
&gt; them to 16-bit greyscale TIFF and TGA or 24-bit TGA, if you can use those.
&gt; I'm searching the net for conversion utilities, so send me info on the
&gt; format you use.

Well, my goal here is to bring some of these presumably glorious Kate
images out of the realm of high powered workstations and into the hands
of lowly microcomputer users.   I'm sure there are a lot of Kate fans 
who are micro users out there who would like to have these images in
in GIF format in VGA or Super VGA resolution.  This would make the images
accessable to PC, Amiga, ST and  (I think) Mac users.  If you can still 
help and you are interested drop me some E-mail.  

&gt; Kylie etc. Occasionaly Madonna turns out a truly great song/video. "Live
&gt; to Tell" is perfect at the end of the film "At Close Range" and the video
&gt; for "Oh Father" is very moving. No shit, watch it with the lights out and
&gt; forget you ever heard of Madonna. 

I really enjoyed the video for "Express Yourself", although I don't think 
much of the song.  Somebody did a tremendous job of bringing the 
"Metropolis" atmosphere into full color.  Also I have to wonder how many 
of the dance moves she does in this video are meant to be taken seriously 
and how much of it is just a parody of certain other "artists".

If there is an anti-Kate it must be....Alice Cooper.  Don't believe it?
Alice did a cover of "Sun Arise" way back in 1972.  Right after "Ballad
of Dwight Frye" on "Love It To Death".
