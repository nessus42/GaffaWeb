Just to say that the quality of this new bootleg CD's sound is _not_
good. It is obviously a more or less straight copy from the _vinyl_
album _Cathy's_Album_Too_. The "hiss", etc., which woj described
hearing on the first track (_Kashka__) is in fact surface noise from
the defective vinyl pressing which served as the CD-bootleggers'
source. It's terrible. The only difference that IED could discern was
an increased boominess and muffled quality in the bass, particularly
noticeable in the piano's lower range.
   The reference on the packaging to "home demo recordings, ca. 1974"
or whatever, is of course wrong and without any foundation.
Bootleggers seem to have a kind of unwritten code of dishonour when it
comes to identifying their material--they're required to misspell and
mistitle as many of the tracks on the album as possible, to give the
collection as a whole a title which had previously been used to
identify a _different_ bootleg product (for which said title was
equally inappropriate!), and above all to misdate and mislocate the
source tape.
   Despite all these problems, it _is_ great to have even some
of the demos on CD.

   P.S.: Answers to three sample test questions:

         1.) In 1982 Kate, in an article written for the Kate Bush
Club Newsletter, described how she instructed her musicians to play
their parts--generally not with traditional musical terms, but via
visual imagery. In the case of Eberhard Weber's bass part for
_Pull_Out_the_Pin_, for example, Kate saw "a panther, stalking through
the jungle." She used a similar image later, when describing work on
the _Hounds_of_Love_ sessions. IED assumes that the bassline, if
associable with a specific character in the song, represents the Viet
Cong guerrilla fighter, not the clumsy, disheartened U.S. G.I.
         2.) The rhythm track on _Jig_of_Life_ was suggested to Kate
by her brother Paddy, who heard something like it in a recording he
himself had made of what he identified as a Greek (or Northern
Italian) "fire dance".
         3.) The "fall of Jericho" was a bit of a trick question.  The
name Jericho should immediately suggest the video of _Experiment_ _IV_
to all Kate Bush fans, since that film features a Dr. Jerry Coe in a
lead role. When Dr. Coe arrives at the secret laboratories at the
beginning of the video the time on the clock reads twelve o'clock
noon. Toward the end of the disastrous fourth experiment, the time can
be made out on a wristwatch--about 5:30 p.m. So, the answer to the
question is "about five and a half or six hours."

     P.P.S.: In the flier which came with the recent mini-Newsletter,
_Homeground_/_KBC_ convention-organizers suggested that teams of five
people should sign up as contestants in the quiz on the day of the
convention itself. IED would like to form a team with other
Love-Hounds. Since there may be a good many more than that who want to
join a team, IED suggests that at least one team should comprise only
American Love-Hounds. Any volunteers?
