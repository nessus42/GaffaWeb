{  This post is a couple of days old now;  I've annotated it where 
   appropriate... Thanks, |&gt;oug, for getting us going again!  }

Vickie says:
&gt;       [stuff about Eno]

Hmmm...  I hope to see Eno at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts this Sunday:
maybe I should shout out KaTe's name as well.  Either we'd wear him down
or make him paranoid (international KTBush conspiracies... wait a second,
I guess we *are* an international KTBush conspiracy!).  Grafitti from
a Carleton College bathroom:  "Eno is God -- He begat his only son David
Byrne to save us all" (I paraphrase -- dan, do you remember this one?).

{  Well, I saw Eno last night -- standing room only, about 800 people or so.
   He is a remarkably articulate, witty speaker; he seemed to enjoy speaking
   with the audience, even if most of the questions were kinda silly.  He
   will be giving a talk at the Museum of Modern Art in NY on ?Thursday?;
   highly recommended.  }

I saw Sonic Youth on Friday in Boston;  I thought it was an amazing show!
(I must confess I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did...)  I
was suprised at how structured and controlled the performance was: for all
of the feedback, distortion, banged instruments, and mangled vocals, SY
was really playing straight-ahead, almost folky, rock 'n' roll.  There was
a nice rapport between the group and the audience as well:  they were not
the New York art snobs I had feared.  Kim Gordon was physically and often
vocally the center of the group:  she sounded a little hoarse, and looked
very dangerous.  Definately worth the gamble if they come to your hometown.

I'm still tracking down London info;  everything I've gotten through official
sources is seriously $$$$$$$$.  If anybody has found any good deals, please
let me know.  I'm also told that Hammersmith is not the nicest place to stay:
I'm now looking for places an easy tube-ride away.  Some quotes from the
Michelin Green Guide:

"The buildings of North Hammersmith are not known for architectural merit..."
"Nothing could be more urban than Hammersmith Terrace..."
"Hammersmith Broadway is pounded by traffic going west to join the M4..."

(Though any guidebook that fails to mention the Hammersmith Odeon as a 
historic site is clearly suspicious... 8-] )

well, footah!
