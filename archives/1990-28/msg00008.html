Thi is about the Concert of the Cocteau Twins, last Tuesday in
Utrecht (Holland). Forgive me if my English is bad :)

Okay, here goes:

There were two bands playing, the band that played first was terrible :)
(Not the kind of music I like anyway :) ) and fortunately didn't
play very long. Then there was a pause in which almost all of the
stage was taken away. (i.e. the drums, keyboards etc. the first group
used.) Only four guitar amps and a microphone stand and a drum-machine
were left on stage. The tension grewm as did the suspense :) I didn't have
any idea how they would sound live. Furthermore I didn't like the
Blue Bell Knoll (if that's the right title) album. It wasn't very
Cocteau Twins like.

But the concert was __BEAUTIFUL__!!!! The sound was PERFECT and not
a single note sung was even slightly out of tune! Perfect!!!! They played
a couple of old songs and a lot of new stuff, probably from there
newest album of which I don't know the title.

It wasn't like other popconcerts, there were no people dancing, but the
public was very entousiastic. Except for the light-show (which was
beautiful and much like their record sleeves) the stage was quite
static. I mean four people playing guitars and a drum-machine and 
a singer does look static :)

But it was beautiful, and I wish it would have lasted many hours 
longer, but after two returns (or is it come-backs? I don't know
the word, the dutch word is 'toegift') the concert was over...

I didn't know the Cocteau Twins were that popular, the Utrecht
Concert Hall Vredenburg was completely full, I think the
concert was sold-out. Most people wore black clothes. (I used
to do too, a couple of years ago, but not anymore)

Anyway, I extrapolate that their newest album must be very good :)

Greetings!!!!!!!!
