&gt; My interpretation of "The Big Sky?"  What do you think it means?

No... that was another article that got lost...

Anyway... I always thought "The Big Sky" was just basically
about how this album is more commercially oriented... "They look
down at the ground, missing" I thought referred to listeners who
won't look for anything nontrivial in songs, like the people
left on the ground by the airplane in the Anderson lyrics I
quoted.  Thus "You never understood me/You never really tried"
is along the same lines... the ark, and the "if you're coming
jump", goes along with the Anderson lyrics' notion of the
listener being carried off by the song, leaving the "clearer
companions" behind on the ground.

I don't know what the "looks like ireland" means, unless it was
an allusion to some complex music (cloud&lt;-&gt;fog) that was based
on some Irish music... but that these origins weren't so
prevalent in the current album.

Of course, it could be my interpretation is all wrong... that
song doesn't particularly strike me, except being about making
trivial music to appeal to the mass market.

&gt; My question about about "two steps"?

I don't understand that either, I was going to ask what the
"throw them in the lake" was about, in fact.  I mean, foxes hide
their tracks in water when hounds are following them... but this
says "2 steps *on* the water," which has a sort of "walking on
water" image to it.  (No, I didn't get the original question,
though).
