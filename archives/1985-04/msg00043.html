Well, since it's been a couple of weeks and no one got the 100 point bonus
question, I'll give it all away.  (Henry Chai got the 10 point bonus
question!)

There's this guy named Peter Reich who wrote a book called "A Book of
Dreams".  It's about him and his father Wilhelm Reich, who was a famous
psychiatrist.  Wilhelm Reich invented this thing called the Orgone
accumulator which would accumulate Orgone Energy, which is life energy.
If you got into one of these Orgone accumulators, it would build up your
life energy.  Deserts are caused by UFOs that come and suck up Orgone
Energy from the atmosphere.  Wilhelm Reich also invented an alternate
from of the Orgone accumulator called the cloudbuster.  It would sap
Orgone energy from UFOs and put it back in the atmosphere.  This would
cause it to rain.

Now fluorescent lights and glow-in-the-dark yoyos are very very bad for
one's Orgone Energy, so Wilhelm made Peter bury his yoyo.  But every now
and then Peter would want to play with it anyway, even though he knew it
was bad for him.  So he would dig it up, play with it for a while, and
then bury it again.  One day while Peter was still a little kid, the FDA
came along and threw Wilhelm in jail where he died a few years later.
