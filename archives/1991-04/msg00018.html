I HOPE THIS DOESN'T GET SENT TWICE (BUT I KNOW IT WILL) 
I HOPE THIS DOESN'T GET SENT TWICE (BUT I KNOW IT WILL) 

        A friend of mine (non-Kate Bush fan) said that he just saw a brief
thing on Kate on the E! channel (he thinks).  It said that she was currenly in
the studio working on an album that was due to arrive in MAY and had a little
fotage of her in the studio (I don't know if it was new or old footage).  I
don't know how valid any of this info is.  
        FOR THE MODERATOR: I have a very large TEXT file that I would like to
post and was wondering what the restrictions were on sizes of messages.  When
I am done the text file would be about 170k so I was thinking of dividing it
up into 30k sections.  I remember you saying something about "hogging net
bandwidth" or something or the other but have seen HUGE messages here so I am
confused.  I would just upload it to the archives but 1) I don't have access
to the archives 2) lots of people here don't have access to the archives and
the file is something that I think everybody would really like to have.  I
won't be done with it for a couple of weeks so there is no hurry, but
currently I plan to upload it in 30k sections, one a day.  Would that cause
any problems?
        Does anyone know where I can get a poster of the older photo of Kate
in the tight blue outfit in the studio (the same one that I included in my
picture sets).  I showed it to a friend of mine and he wanted and copy and now
insists that I ask to see if I can find him a poster.  I think his interest is
non-musical, but I promised him I would ask.........
