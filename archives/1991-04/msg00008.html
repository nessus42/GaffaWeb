I've lost what little respect I still had for Sinead O'Connor.
I support her desire to stand up for what she believes in but every
time she opens her mouth she just seems to prove how clueless she
really is.

  "A world war is on because we care about material success, and here
  we are rewarding it in the music industry."

  "It's a frightening prospect that the _Wilson Phillips_ album was
  declared one of the year's best artistic works.  That wasn't decided
  on how it has healed or inspired the human race, but on how many
  copies it sold.  That just makes me puke."

You know what makes me puke?  A holier than thou attitude.  Where does
she get off maligning _Wilson Phillips_?  No, it's not particularly
sophisticated in it's concepts but are their sentiments any less
sincere than O'Conner's?  Sure, they're simple love songs but who says
a simple love song can't provide just as much "healing" for some simple
soul in pain as some sort of holier than ode to the Politically
Correct?

No, I'm not a fan of Wilson Phillips but I don't think someone who got
a free ride on a Prince tune has any right to insult other artists,
particularly those that aren't really showing any more signs of
commercialism than herself.

  "There isn't any amount of money that's worth sacrificing the truth
  for, I'd rather starve than keep quiet."

Wonderful, I wouldn't want it any other way.  People like Sinead do as
much harm to their cause as good.  She talks but nothing comes out.
Unless she decides to cover more Prince tunes look for her to fall
back into obscurity where she and her fans can wallow in Political
Correctness in peace.
