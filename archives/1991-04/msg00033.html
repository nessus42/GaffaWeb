1990 Kate Bush Convention Photos
--------------------------------
SECOND VERSION - UPDATE 02-05-91 

        What follows is my attempt to describe the photos from the convention.
 Since some people have and some people haven't read my previous descriptions
of my experience and some people were and some people were not there when
these photos were taken, I will assume that you don't know anything and try to
describe each picture as well as my *limited* memory will allow.  If anybody
has more info please send me a message and I will try to repost this file with
the updated info (does anybody have a transcript?).  Each new paragraph
describes the next photograph.  Special thanks to Ray Russel for help me sort
em out!  Thanks to Jorn Barger, Andy Semple, and Gregory Bossert for more info
on group shots.   
        
        Outside, waiting for the doors to open.
        The stage.  Many of these early photos came out slightly too dark. 
Sorry. 
     The room starts filling up
        Introductions 
        Auctioning off Kate's coat.  (I didn't win!) 
        The view from behind me. 
        The first band.  Kinda a rock-dance band if I remember. 
        Crowd shot in front of me. (Only in a few sets, I had a couple of misc
shots that I didn't want!)
        Another performer (notice I have now snuck into the middle!, I was
right behind all those rude people who stood up.) 
        Shot from behind me!  See any faces you know????? I was going to type
a rude comment about somebody, but it might be someone you know so I won't!
        Another performer, I believe this was the one that did a great version
of "Infant Kiss" (but don't quote me!). 
        Del Palmer. 
        Del auctions off a tour badge. 
        Dancers. 
        One of the Kate videos. 
        Paddy Bush. 
        Jorn Barger coming off the stage after winning a signed video.  He and
I had made an agreement that if one of us won we would take a photo of the
other one on stage.  Jorn won, using a ticket that I had gone and bought for
him!!  I was so upset that I forgot to take his picture until after he was
coming off stage!  In the background is Neil Calton accepting his award.
        Setting up the couch 
        Here she is! 
        Kate looks around. 
        Kate plops down!  Right after this is when she made her too-cute
gesture of leaning forward with her hands on her knees.  I didn't get it.
ARGH!!! 
        Kate makes a fist?? 
        Kate reading some questions. 
        Kate.
        Kate smiles.  I would like to think , but don't know, that she is
smiling in response to the audience applauding.  At one point fairly early she
was talking about how she didn't like her first two albums as much as the
later ones.  I shouted out, "Well we love them anyways!" which got everybody
cheering.  As far as I remember, that was the only time that everybody
applauded in response to something shouted out, and I THINK I got a photo
right after.  This might be it.  
        Kate 
        Kate 
        Kate 
        Kate gets help with a question 
        Awesome Kate expression. 
        Blurry Kate. 
        Blurry Kate. 
        Kate 
        Kate gestures.
        Kate shows off a drawing given by a fan, one of my favorites. 
        Kate looks at another gift. 
        Kate 
        Kate
        Kate 
        Kate 
        Kate goes "em?" 
        Kate gets a gift from the LOVE-HOUNDS.  Kate "thank you" 
        Kate drinks 
        I think at this point is when she announced the tour.  I am not sure
exactly but she got the flowers, announced the tour, sang, and then left and I
THINK that is what is happening here
        Kate smiles 
        Kate clears her throat
        BLURRY. 
        Kate applauds? 
        Kate singing (I think). 
        Kate singing 
        Kate singing
        Kate smiles as she finishes sings 
        THE CROWD GOES WILD. 
        Kate gets ready to go 
        Kate gets told that she has a surprise waiting for her. 
        Turns around sees the platinum album for the Sensual World. 
        Kate shows off her prize and thinks "I'm such a lucky goil" (this is
speculation). This is one of my favorites 
        Kate with record. 
        Kate sits. DARK
        Kate thanks record man. 
        Kate sits! 
        Gets up to go.
        Kate gathers her loot and thinks "wow, I hope I get this much great
stuff at the tour!" (this is speculation). 
        Kate blurry. 
        Kate REALLY blurry 
        Kate kisses us thinking "this is for that guy who shouted 'we love
them anyway'" (this is wishful thinking).
        Kate leaves, out of our lives until the tour. 
        
        Del Palmer came back after Kate left and signed autographs for a few
people.  I asked him "can I get a photo of you smiling since I don't have any
photos of you smiling".  This busted him up, and he posed for this shot. 
Probably my favorite picture. 
        Del signing autographs.  I asked him if the tour would be playing the
U.S. and he said they would be playing five shows.  I asked him if they would
be coming to San Diego, and he said they would only be playing the five shows.
 I gave him my "I love San Diego" T-Shirt, which has a listing of reasons to
come to San Diego, and asked him to give it to Kate.  I heard later that she
got it and liked it, but couldn't figure out what all the reasons meant!!!!! 
        A pictures of Ray Russel (fellow San Diego Kate fan).  I only included
this in a few sets. 
        Love-Hounds united and strong!  Following is Jorn's description with
updates from Gregory Bossert:

        Picture of the above photo being taken. 
        McDonalds shot (only in a few sets). 
        
        The day after the convention a few of us were lucky enough to go to
the Home of the couple that runs the Homeground fanzine.  These are a couple
of shots on the way.
        A couple of us waiting for the car to arrive! 
        Our hero! (me) 
        The car arrives.
        Together at Peter + Krys's house.  I am the one taking the photo.
Following is Jorn's description:     

and at homeground central, starting at the center and working in a clockwise
spiral around the room: 
 
vickie, ed, chris, nigel kennedy(? uncertain:^), krys, pami, paul, jorn, larry
(in infamous, reviled black-bart-don't-do-drugs sweatshirt), dave cross,
peter. 
 
dave emceed the Con (he's older than 15, though in this photo you can't tell),
and paul and pami host the yearly "wuthering hike". 
 
        KATE IN BLUE OUTFIT. AHEM.  
        A couple of more shots of Kate walls. 
        Love-sardines.  (THIS SHOULD ACTUALLY BE AFTER THE PICTURES OF KATE,
BUT I AM TO TIRED TO RE-ARRANGE ALL THE SETS!). This should be in the next
HOMEGROUND.  The last issue asked "How many Love-Hounds can you fit in a car"
and said that they would be printing the answer in the next issue.  We got
stuck at the train station cause the train took off earlier than we were told
and one of the two-cars driving us there had left!  So we all tried to leave
using just the one car!  I offered to go in the trunk, but they wouldn't let
me! (I'm experimental!!).  Anyways, three of us, me + Vickie + Chris, ended up
spending the night.  
        The next morning at the train station. 
        Waving goodbye. 


Later that day, I went to a Beatles exhibition in London, and then the next
day headed out to walk around Welling for a while.  
        2 Shots On the train to Welling 
        Shot of a park near where Kate lives.  I walked around for a couple of
hours to get the feel of British city.  I am normally not able to walk for
very long without feeling pain and then a bad limp in my left hip, yet on this
day I didn't feel any pain there at all!!  Excitement, Kate vibes, or ?????
        Another park near where Kate lives. 
        The public area behind Kate's family farm. (This is the photo with all
the green grass for those with only a few pictures) I didn't exactly know
where I was at first, then I met a nice lady who casually mentioned that Kate
Bush lived over there!  Kate's house is the white one in the middle. 
        Our hero (me again). This is a self-portrait, holding the camera out
in front of me. 

That's all the photos. I only stayed near the farm for a minute or two.  I
felt like I was imposing, even though I was on a public street, and was kinda
hoping nobody would see me.  The funny thing is as I was walking back towards
a pub on the end of the street, Kate and Del drove by!!! I only saw them for a
second, and wasn't sure it was them at first, but now I am.  They probably
didn't see me.  Anyways afterwards I went to the pub where I talked to a
female pub-keeper and she told me I was the most normal "Kate Bush gazer" that
she had ever seen!  That was a scary thought!!!  The next day I went to
Liverpool to see the Beatles sites, then to Wales to see the place where the
Prisoner was filmed, and then I came home.  A thousand bucks poorer, but
richer in many other ways, as they say. 

        I hope you all enjoy these.  I am no John Bush (either in my access to
Kate or my talent!) but I think these are not bad.  Again, I am sorry for all
the delays!!!! 

Ronald "I cannot believe I finally sent the pictures" Hill 

Apart from the photograph 
They'll get nothing from me 
Not until they let me see my solicitor
