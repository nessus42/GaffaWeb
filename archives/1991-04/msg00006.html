Someone asked again for my address so here it is: 

550 Oxford Apt 639 
Chula Vista,  CA  91911

1-619-426-8939

The new sets will be 22 dollars if sent to America and 26 dollars overseas.
They will be on a pay-your-money-first basis.  Also I still haven't got the
money for Evan Walsh.  If it doesn't come before I make the next set I will
give this set here to whomever sends the money first and give them back the 5
dollars difference.  
        Also, I have yet to receive any letters for the FREE leftovers set. 
For the price of a stamp I have about 10 sets that are the leftover from the
last run.  THese include the lovehounds group shot, the group shot at Peter +
krys's house, a shot of Kate's farm, and several other non-kate photos.  Get
em while they are wet!!! 
 
        A friend of mine let me borrow his set of Carriad Kate's and there is
a reprint of an article in issue 12 called Bush-Whack.  It has a photo of Kate
telling off the photographer with Del holding her back.  Supposidly, the
photographer bumped into her and Kate responded by giving him a swift kick. 
Does anybody know anything else about this.  This is the first time I have
ever seen evidence of Kate being mad at someone (aside from the "Pratt"
interview) and I find it very interesting.  On my friends copy, you cannot see
the photo very well, does anybody know the source and if it is reprinted
clearer somewhere???  For those of you who haven't read the article, the
"injured" photographer said " I didn't think anyone that small would be able
to kick so hard"....
