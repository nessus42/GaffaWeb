Yes, Gabriel is playing the Worcester Centrum on November 21st. BUT!

The Centrum already gave out 200 bracelets to people last Thursday. See,
the Centrum has a really neat (for which read: brain-damaged) way of selling
tickets: You go there a week before tickets go on sale and get a bracelet,
just like the kind you get in the hospital. Then, when tickets go on sale,
those who come to the box office with bracelets get served first. So, you
have two pecking orders when the box office opens: those-with-bracelets-
who-got-there-first, then those-without-bracelets-who-got-there-first. If
I were the first person at the Centrum, I'd STILL be #201. Pretty fucked,
eh? Take all the fun out of camping out.

However, the Centrum is 100% Ticketron/Teletron. So, the smart thing to do
is to get some plastic (MasterCard, Visa, American Depressed) and call the
NEW YORK TELETRON line when tickets go on sale at 10:00am. Since the Centrum
opens at 10:00am for tickets, if you call the NYC TeleTron at 10 also, you
get equally good seating. 'Course, there's a service charge, but it's worth
it.

Me? I'm camping out at my local "Good Vibrations" store, which has a Ticket-
ron in it.


CDs - I've had no luck finding any good imports in The Harvard Coop. They're
so snotty they'd probably look at me and say "Genesis? Look in the Bible 
section, 4th floor". Second Coming staff DO talk to God, or at least have a
telex line. I can never say enough good things about Second Coming Records.
Best selection anywhere, best prices, best staff. Walked in one day and they
were playing Pere Ubu REALLY LOUD. Followed that with Einsturzende Neubauten,
REALLY LOUD. People on the street thought there was construction going on...
(By the way, my German dad heard me trying to pronounce EN's name as
"EIN-stur-zen-da NOI-bow-ten", and corrected me. The official pronunciation
is "Ein-SHTUR-zendanoiboten", like it was one word) Second Coming may not
have the most new stuff, but the prices are unbeatable. There's also a Second
Coming in NYC. Newbury Comix is a great hang-out for Gnu Wave trendoids with
completely BLACK wardrobes. Record selection is intense - they have EVERYTHING.
However, you pay through the nose, ass, ear, and armpit for it. Picked up
the Julian Cope "World Shut Your Mouth" single for an ungodly $4. On the other
hand, I picked up the Shriekback "Fish Below the Ice" double-pak for the same
price. Record prices are usually $7.99 or so. Peter Murphy's new album goes for
$12 or so. NO bootlegs whatsoever, but they have enourmous buying power and if
they stocked up, they could run Second Coming Records (Boston Bootleg Heaven)
out of business for life. CD prices are on the high side, but they have enough
sales and coupons in newspapers to make it decent. Selection is inbetween the
Harvard Coop's and Boston CD's. I'd still go to Boston CD. They have EVERY CD
that you could want. NO, they don't have The Dreaming. However, they DO have
lots of rare and generally unavalible-from-Sam-Goody's CDs that we all want.
Hell, they had a Meredith Monk CD. They have lots of industrial. Prices are
wretched and outrageous. Only for the strong of will, heart, and wallet.

WHO IS DIAMANDA GALAS? I *hate* *hate* *hate* the attitude of "I'm going
to mention an artist and assume that you ALL know who I'm talking about".
Who is Current 93? WHO WHO WHO?? WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE???? Inquiring minds
want to know.

And, speaking of bootlegs... AVOID WITH A PASSION the Peter Gabriel bootleg
"Shock the Dog" (aka "Schonmanner"). It's a WOMAD Festival bootleg (the
big money-losing hoop-de-doo that Gabriel premiered his PG4 songs at) and
it stinks. One side is the sound check. Oh joy and yummies. However, DO
pick up "Mr. Mozo Risin'" and "Ain't That Peculiar?". Both feature never-
before-heard PG songs like "Down the Line", and early-and-twisted versions
of "White Shadow", "Not One of Us", and others. Also, "Mr Mozo Risin'" has
PG doing "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway", a rarity for a PG concert.

Speaking, again, of PG. I was positing a little while ago... "So" is a very
non-electronic album. PG will probably be doing a LOT off of "So". Thusly,
he won't have a lot of room on stage for electronics, what with all those
backup singers, horn sections, etc... So, my guess is that we'll get
treated to a LOT of older PG, considering he'll be more set-up to do rockish
numbers like "Modern Love", "D.I.Y.", "Slowburn", etc... which is fine by
me, 'cause I prefer that stuff...

Anyway. Class time approacheth. Oh, to Bill Hsu: I wouldn't have time
to write a huge flame, I'll be too busy shivering as I wait in line at
3am for my Gabriel tix...!

				I have no .signature and I must scream,
						Joe

Oh! by the by. There is now a LYRICS SERVER running off the Univeristy
of Massachusetts at Amherst CYBER 175 machine. For more information,
send a subject-less letter with the word "help" as the only text to:
		LYRICS%UMASS.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU
They are getting more and more albums by the day, and they DO have class:
I was requested to type in the lyrics to "The Dreaming", which I did.
They *do* need submissions.
