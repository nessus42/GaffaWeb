&gt;Someone once told which well-known band Julian Cope is an ex-member of.
&gt;Please refresh my memory.  I heard his cover of Ubu's "Non-alignment Pact"
&gt;on the radio this morning -- which album/CD is it on?

Julian Cope was a member of The Teardrop Explodes.  He has also
made two solo LP's, 'World Shut Your Mouth' and 'Fried'.
'World' is a great album!

"Non-alignment Pact" is from a new Cope EP in the stores now.
The other tunes are "World Shut Your Mouth" (left over from the
album of same name, maybe?), "Levitation", "Umpteenth Unnatural
Blues" and "Transporting" &lt;--(Bizarre un-Cope like tune).
Does this single mean there is a possible forthcoming album?
Only Cope's hairdresser knows for sure, and judging from Julian's
hair, his hairdresser is just as loopy as he is!

&gt;the domestic release of 'Strange Times', the third album by the Chameleons
&gt;has been out...  I bought the import, and I just noticed that the domestic
&gt;version comes with one of those 'limited edition free LP's'...

&gt;I am just wondering wot is ON this bonus LP...  if you know, please send
&gt;me a reply...

The EP has covers of "John, I'm Only Dancing" and an especially psychedelic
cover of "Tomorrow Never Knows", which 801 covered so well a few years back.
Also, versions of "Paradiso" and "Tears", tunes that are on the latest single,
and another tune that I can't think of now.

&gt;	the Electric Guitars were this band that toured with Peter Gabriel
&gt;during the '82/'83 tour (Security).  They played a sort of industrial pop
&gt;melange, as I recall.  Featured a lead vocalist who enjoyed beating on a large
&gt;petroleum drum with some sort of metal rod, kind of like a baseball bat.
&gt;They released one single as far as I know and were selling it at the concert.

I remember that band!  I have a single by them called "Wolfman Tap" and a
friend has a single called "Ghengis Khan" I think.  The 55 gallon "drum"
that the vocalist used was so much scrap metal by the time he was done
with it.  Industrial pop melange - I like that term.  I can hear the critics
now talking about the latest I.P.M. band.   8^)

Speaking of obscure bands, has anybody ever heard of Red Math, from Ohio?
I bought a 6 tune EP about 18 months ago because I was told they sounded
like Shriekback.  So they don't sound like Shriekback, but they do play
a fine sort of slick funk pop (S.F.P.??) in the style of Shriekback.
Recommended listening.

And speaking of Shriekback, they and Love and Rockets are playing
Metro in Boston in early November.  Yow!  To quote the great Michael
Jackson, "I'll Be There"!

Lather On,
           -Dan
