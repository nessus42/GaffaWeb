Joe Turner sez he *hates* the `attitude' inherent in talking about a band or
person and assuming everyone knows about him/her/them ...
Well the way I see it, *I* don't have an `attitude' at all about anything
like this; it's a lot easier on the fingers to just mention someone and if
there are people sufficiently intrigued that don't know who is being talked
about, then they raise their electronic hand and say `Teach, wouldja mind
telling us a little about these folks?'.  If we gave a band history and
personality profile of everybody that comes down the pike that isn't 
`obviously' well known we'd never get anything useful said.
What I DON'T understand is why he mentions this immediately after mentioning
how `Second Coming records' and `Newbury Comix' have "everything" and
their staff "talks to GOD".  Well if they do, then why not ask THEM about
people like this??  Or, failing that, go to the imports and look for
their records.  Check out the sleeves and make up your own minds.  Better yet,
if you're a good customer, do what I do.  Ask them to PLAY some of the damn
stuff.  They won't bite.  If they know you, it usually ain't too hard to
get people to acquiesce (specially if they think it'll make a sale).  If you
can pull this off, then you're in great shape, because it sure beats the
`Buy it and Hate it, sorry only $3 on trade in for your $10 LP' approach.
Quality Control, without being in your living room!

Speaking of semantics, you people are getting `EVIL' confused with `SATANIC'.
Diamanda Galas is hardly `Satanic'.  Evil, maybe.  She may sound `possessed',
but that's hardly Satanic.  Current .93., on the other hand, have released
an LP of Aleister Crowley reading his poetry &amp; stuff, and their mail order
catalogue includes Marquis De Sade, Crowley, and other fun readables.  They
are WAY more Satanic than Diamanda could EVER be.  If you need further
proof, just check out the cover of their `In Menstrual Night' picture disk.
They also have an LP, called `Nightmare Culture' (which consists of Current
.93. on one side, and a "supergroup" [heh heh] of Current .93., Coil, and
Boyd Rice under the nom-de-plume `Sickness of Snakes' on the other) which
is quite simply the most frightening album I've ever heard, by light-years ...
I wonder how many of you who jumped up with `Diamanda is more Satanic' 
have ever even HEARD or OWN a Current .93. record ... Yow ...

Random Shit:
	The Virgin Prunes cancelled their U.S. tour because (apparently)
Gavin Friday [vox] had a nervous breakdown and is in the hospital right now.
Guess the thought of American Disco Stardom was just too much to bear  :-)
Too bad, as my cronies' bands Factory &amp; Abecedarians were scheduled to open.
Oh well, c'est la guerre ...

	Just got an old tape of some French underground stuff ... anybody
heard of vinyl by a band called `Kykl' [sounds like Siouxsie fronting X-mal
Deutschland with (when they were good) A Certain Ratio horns]??  Other
good stuff by `Ausweiss', `MKB', `Norma Loy' ... makes ya wonder how much
stuff like this is going unnoticed in far corners of the globe ...
