&gt;       What is the best hardcore album (hopefully available)?

Well, I don't know if you'd call them HARDCORE, but I was basically
introduced to these bands by somebody who listened to a lot of
"thrash" stuff as well...Flipper's "Album" is one of my favorite
records ever.  I don't have a rational reason for this, I just love
the thing.  It's not really loud and fast enough to be called
hardcore, though.  There are two very long tracks, one at the end
of each side, guaranteed to alarm your neighbors if you crank 'em
up loud.  And some niftykeen songs that are definitely the catchiest
in this genre ("Way of the World," "Life")...Meat Puppets' "II" has
a bit of everything, from hardcore to country to pop.  Slightly
Violent Femmes-like.  The only album of theirs I like, by the way.

&gt;  Any recommendations from the Severed Heads fans
&gt;out there as to what else I should hunt down by the band?

The "Goodbye Tonsils" EP is worth checking out, as is "City Slab
Horror," their second (I think) album.  Oh yeah, and "Dead Eyes
Opened," an EP on Nettwerk Records.

&gt;                                                  -Peter
&gt;"If the world were a different place,
&gt;  It'd occupy another space"
&gt;                     -The Woodentops

You're a man after my own heart, Peter.  By the way, the 'Tops will
be coming back to America (swoon) next week!!!!!!  They're playing
in DC on the 23rd and I can't wait.  If they are coming to your town,
SEE them.  Next to Robyn Hitchcock, they're my fave live band.  And
they've got a cute singer.  Sigh.  OK, I'll shut up now.

If you've got some extra cash burning a hole in your pocket, I
propose you spend it on The Fall's "Bend Sinister" and The Chameleons'
"Strange Times."  Both LPs have brought me loads of happiness in the
past week (and boy, have I needed it).  Note to anybody who thinks
the Fall is too "weird" or "inaccessible" -- their new album is
the most "commercial" thing they've ever done.  OK, so they're not
going to be signing with CBS anytime soon, but still...they are
a BRILLIANT band!

Sometimes I think that there is nothing more wonderful than music.
