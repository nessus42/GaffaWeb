Now we all know how The Sisters Of Mercy are DEATHROCK and so if you listen
to DEATHROCK SHIT LIKE THIS then why don't you just GO DIE; on the other hand
if you liked The Sisterhood's `Giving Ground' single then don't miss the vox
JAMES RAY &amp; THE PERFORMANCE's `Mexico Sundown Blues/Edie Sedgwick' 12" on
Merciful Release.  The A side has the `Giving Ground' singer warbling over a
track that sounds vaguely like a clash between Liasons Dangereuses and New
Order; on the B side we find what amounts to an aural Homage to the great band
Suicide ...

Nostalgia fans can run out and get `The Peel Sessions' EP from NEW ORDER.
This dates from 1982.  If you ever wondered what N.O. doing a reggae song
sounded like give a listen to `Turn The Heater On' on the A side.  For
collectivists the flip side features an unavailable-elsewhere track `Too Late'.
The other two tracks are different versions of the `Power, Corruption &amp; Lies'
LP tracks `5-8-6' and `We All Stand' ...

Mentioned elsewhere in this rag was the new DANIELLE DAX 12" featuring
`Where The Flies Are/Up In Arms/When I Was Young' ...

Over in wank.musack Tom Dube pontificated about the new HE SAID 12" featuring
`Pulling 3gs/Pale Feet'.  To which I can only concur - `Pulling 3gs' being
an upbeat track very unlike previous Lewis/Gilbert compositions, whereas the
flip `Pale Feet' kind of drags its ...

The adventurous can sink their teeth into two recent releases from Belgium's
A;GRUMH...  (No, that's not line noize), the `Underground' EP and the
`Mix Yourself' EP.  As yet mostly unheard, a;Grumh... had a previous LP
release called `Rebearth' which mixed Current 93, PTV &amp; Crowley with equal
parts ... the current batch finds them more `accessable', yet listen to their
Pink Floyd From Hell version of `Another Brick In The Wall Pt. II' on the
`Underground' EP ...

If you liked that, then next you could flaggellate yourself with the Special
Gentle Mix version of CONTROLLED BLEEDING's `Headcrack' LP.  Apparently
Special Gentle Mix isn't a Joke as some tracks are atmospheric little ditties
evocative of certain computer graphics videos soundtracks ...

We reach back into the recent past for IN THE NURSERY's `Temper' EP which
immediately preceeds (and contains 1 track from) their masterful `Twins' LP...
also, we have the latest SWANS `A Screw (Holy Money)//Blackmail/A Screw' 12"
only now showing up on western shores (or, was I too busy Californicating
in my Hottub with Wine Coolers to pick it up?  Film at 11 ...).

Also on Sweatbox (IN THE NURSERY's label) is a new band called PERENNIAL
DIVIDE with an LP `Purge'; more on this later ...

For those of us old enough to hear good hardcore music that reminds us of Why
We Liked It In The First Place (rather than Hardbore), there's the strident
yet non-random strains of RUBELLA BALLET who have a new 12" `Artic [sic]
Flowers//Mummy/Mescalito', with an LP to follow.  Those of you who only
listen to Politically Correct music may note that these folks started out
on XNTRIX records (home of Poison Girls and Flux Of Pink Indians at one time,
correct me if I'm wrong) so there's yer Street Cred for ya ...

Then of course, there's the flip side to hardcore (gotta show I'm still King
Wavo, you know) which comes to us in the form of the new Double LP by
THIS MORTAL COIL, `Filigree &amp; Shadow'.  Non-Weenies need not apply, of course.

Last but not least we have the answer to the often-asked question, "What do
you get if you crossed Der Plan, DAF, and Test Dept. and asked Blixa Bargeld
to front them and sing in English?" and of course the answer must be the 
masterful new LP from TOOLS YOU CAN TRUST, `Again Again Again' ...


On a significantly different tangent, it appears that those folks at BravEar,
moving at turtle-like pace, have finally blessed us with the Spring '86 issue
(yep, SPRING) ... most notable for all us compugeeks is the fact that they
have now entered the Brave New World of Desktop Publishing!! Yes, sports fans,
see the first underground fanzine to be professionally typeset using what looks
like none other than good ol' Interleaf itself (or an Amazing Simulation).
They even have a credit for `Computer Wizard' in the TOC ... Yow ...
of course the best thing about the ish is the In-Depth interview with the
creator of the best comic in Amurika, `Ferret' (a subject near and dear to my
very own heart) ...

Address for Factory's `Social Abyss' cassingle (blessed-be by yers truly)
Drop in a coupla bux for the tape cost and postage ...
	Factory
	c/o 8000 Honey Drive #11
	Hollywood CA  90046
	(213) 654-5090		(Give `em a cross cuntry call if you gotta
				 free WATS line or somethin and freak em out)


Remember, `knaw' is `wank' spelled sideways, sort-of

(Something for Mr. Weenieski to think about the next time the singer from
Squirrel Bait is ramming his dick inside him whilst the drummer from Volcano
Suns is cumming all over his face as he screams "I WILL evaluate a band based
on the SOUND that comes out of their PA next time, and NOT just on how I decide 
that a band sux the big wanger if they have the gall to not wear holey old 
courdoroys and dirty T-shirts on stage just like I do gosh everybody in a 
band has to look just like me else they're DEATHROCKERS and shit why don't 
they go DIE well whadya mean the last song on side one of `Atomizer' 
called `Bad Houses' sounds just like Sisters Of Mercy so therefore Big Black 
MUST be Deathrocker Wannabes so Big Black should just GO DIE if they wannabe 
DEATHROCKERS")
