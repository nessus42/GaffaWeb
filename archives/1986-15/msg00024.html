	the Electric Guitars were this band that toured with Peter Gabriel
during the '82/'83 tour (Security).  They played a sort of industrial pop
melange, as I recall.  Featured a lead vocalist who enjoyed beating on a large
petroleum drum with some sort of metal rod, kind of like a baseball bat.
They released one single as far as I know and were selling it at the concert.

	Also, the guy who I was with at the concert said that the drummer with
the Electric Guitars looked to be very similar in appearance/technique to a
band that opened for Bruford in '80 called Surface Music.  The drummer in ques-
tion had a style similar to Bruford and he kept hitting this very large
aluminum sheet from time to time which sounded like a sustainless gong.
I couldn't find any material by Surface Music -- anyone know of anything put
out by them?  I doubt they're still around...EPs and such would be dated in
the early eighties, probably.
