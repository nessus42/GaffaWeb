Re: 10 questions
Sorry, you guys don't win anything. You didn't show enough work. :-)
This ain't no game show.

Re: More quasi-Wicinski baiting
I seem to recall Tim putting United States I-V on his Desert Island 10
list, so don't take his ranting so seriously. Incidentally, I'm pretty
disappointed in what Laurie Anderson is doing these days too, but I
already whined about that awhile ago, so... BTW, does anyone have a
live recording of the incredibly industrial version of Gravity's
Angel? It blows away everything she's done. It's very different from
the version on Mister Heartbreak. If you have some way of getting a
decent tape of it I'm willing to pay $$$...

Is John Rossi out there? I need your address!!!

OK, finally some not-so-new music I've picked up recently (I haven't seen
anyone rave about these on lovehounds yet, so if you've had it for
9 months already it's your fault :-))


HONEYMOON KILLERS	LOVE AMERICAN STYLE

If you like noisy guitars, have I got a treat for you. This is good
grungy medium-to-slow throbbing dirgy stuff with a sense of humor.
Lots of dirty guitar/bass and screaming. How can you resist a band
that does a (rather lousy but funny) cover of the Batman theme? My
only complaint is the rather uninventive drumming.


SCOTT JOHNSON		JOHN SOMEBODY

All the rave reviews you've read are true. Scott Johnson can play
guitar. He also uses vocal tape loops as rhythm tracks. His music
is much more "composed" than most non-classical music, and he
does try to integrate elements of rock and academic classical music,
but he does this in a twisted, slightly deranged fashion. Any
comparisons to Philip Glass are irrelevant. For a change, this
is innovative music that's fun to listen to. Call it Birdsongs
of the Mesozoic meet Laurie Anderson (not again!) meet Robert Fripp
if you want to...
