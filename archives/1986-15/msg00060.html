I just watched a movie called, "Curse of the Demon".  It is a British
horror movie made in 1957.  It involves a witch cult that uses a fire
demon to get rid of undesirables.  There was one particularly 
interesting scene during a seance.  The medium contacted the spirit
of one of the fire demon's victims.  He was giving a warning to the
person who has been marked as the demon's next victim, then he broke
off and yelled, "IT'S IN THE TREES!  IT'S COMING!"

     This is not just a coincidence.  My stereo is right next to my
TV, and I played the scene from the film while I played the song
"Hounds of Love", and the voice in the song was lifted from the
soundtrack of the film.

     No, I'm not accusing Kate of being a witch.  I just think this is
an obscure joke about some of the album's images.  If you haven't seen
the movie, you can't possibly know what the voice is screaming about.
But if you have, it's a nice little inside joke.  (Here's the full
quote:  "It's in the trees!  It's coming!  The Demon!  It's coming!"
followed by horrified screams.)

DISCLAIMER:
     I have not seen this said before.  If anyone has pointed this out
before, I did not see it.  I've only been reading this group for
two months.

(P.S., If you're interested, "Curse of Demon" has just been released
on home video by RCA/Columbia.  It is available in both Beta and VHS.)
