I know this is awfully late, but thought I'd kick in my 2 cents
worth anyway.


&gt;&gt; [IED:] This has nothing to do with the line spoken in German from
&gt;&gt; the same part of The Ninth Wave: "Tiefer, tiefer, ergendwo in der
&gt;&gt; Tiefe gibt es ein licht." If you notice, that line, spoken by Gabi
&gt;&gt; Zangerl, is accompanied by the sounds of a submarine's sonar signal.
&gt;&gt; It is IED's theory that this is meant to evoke images of U-boat
&gt;&gt; activity during WWII, and possibly to create the feeling of
&gt;&gt; claustrophobia that must have existed within the confined spaces of
&gt;&gt; a submarine which is a big part of the movie "Das Boot". Kate has
&gt;&gt; several times referred to old war movies as a primary inspiration
&gt;&gt; for The Ninth Wave.
&gt;
&gt;[Doug]It has always my impression that the submarine sonar sounds indicate
&gt;that Kate is rescued by a submarine.  After all, we have the voice
&gt;telling us that "somewhere in the depth, there is a light", then we
&gt;hear submarine sounds, and then Kate is safe on land again.

I agree with Doug and might add that this ties in with the first verse
of the Ninth Wave: "Little Light Shining/ Little Light will guide them
to me/.."   As far as imagery goes, I find a sense of floating and
drifting seems to prevail. Not claustophobia, or even panic at the
thought of drowning.  More of a faith that the 'little light' will
guide her rescuers, leaving her free to experience the wonders of the
depths.

I've a friend in Zurich who looked for TD on CD for me. He reported
no luck.

I vote for 'Listen to me come, baby.'.

Has anyone besides me noticed the airbrushed KT logo on the front cover
of The Dreaming? I never noticed it until last month when I bought a
wall poster of the album.  For all those other unobservant people like
myself, it's on her sweater just below the cuff. (I was always too
entranced by that face to notice anything else.)

In the Eno department, I'd like to mention the book 'More Dark then Shark',
which contains the lyrics to all of Enos vocal songs. It's printed by
Faber and Faber of London. I seem to recall someone out there mentioning
that he thought the lyrics to some of Enos songs might never be published.
Well, here they are. I'll see if I can type them in if anyones interested.
It's by Eno and Mills. Mills does the artwork. It's around $25, a large
format paperback, with all color glossy pages.
