Actually, the Cream Corn ep was engineered to be played at both
45 and 33.  Choose yr poison as it were.

I read one interview with the Buttholes where they talked about the
"infamous" Dead Kennedies video wherein Jello exhorts executives from
MTV (who had the mischance of attending one of his shows) with his,
"MTV - Get off the Air!" song.  The Buttholes said, "y'know, wouldn't
it have been funny if the MTV people stood up and said, "Jello's right,
we suck, let's shut down shop."  Another question posed to them was
as to when they were going to get a major label contract.  Gibby deadpans:L
"Why should we do that?  We'd suck then."

Oh, their next recordings to be released will be two new tracks on
the God's Favorite Dog compilation from Touch And Go.  Also included
are Big Black cuts, Happy flowers, Hose and Scratch Acid (who contributed
non-exclusive materiel - sigh ).  Look for it in the stores.  It's 6$ by
mail order, so I wouldn't shell out more than $7.

*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

Happy Flowers / Broken Siren / REptile HoUse / Eugene Chadbourne
all played at the Hung Jury Pub yesterday to a paltry handfull of
people, mostly punks.  A few wrinkled hippies (yippies?) made it,too.
Happy Flowers, most famous for their "Mom, I gave the Cat Some Acid"
song are a two man group - who usually play with the HC band, The Landlords.
They play bass and guitar.  They play beautiful music.  Or at least
that's what they say.  Mostly, they play a racket.  They've added two
rhythm machines to their set-up and play polyrhythms by putting two
different beats at different speeds.  Broken Siren play an almost dancable
punk which merges into pop at times.  Sorta like the Go-Go's with razor
blades.  Reptile House are sounding better than ever. Daniel's still
reading his lyrics straight out of his poetry book and the xtra guitarist
behaved himself (last month, the entire band beat him up).  When they
release their album, they'll be a trendy band so catch before the stench
arrives.  Eugene is noise.  Eugene is country-bluegrass. Eugene is avant-
garde.  Eugene is heavy metal.  Eugene is hardcore.  Eugene is punk. 
Eugene, he is crazy.  There's no label you can put on Chadbourne except
his own name.  He played this gig alone, flying in the afternoon and
flying out in the evening.  His lyrics remind me of Tom Lehrer at times
and Frank Zappa at others.  His guitar techniques put him in a class of
his own. He played his rake.  He played "The Shah Sleeps in Lee Harvey's
Grave."  The crowd loved him and bought all his records and tapes out.

The promoter is $350 in the hole.
