Archive-name: music/kate-bush-faq-diffs
Last-modified: 1996/06/23
Version: 1.4.l minus 1.4.k

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action.  The full version is posted to
rec.music.gaffa only.  You can get a full copy of the FAQ by requesting it from
me (uli@zoodle.robin.de), or by sending email to majordomo@gryphon.com with the
message contents being "get love-hounds-digest FAQ".  If you can't receive more
than 64KB in one piece I can split the FAQ for you.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.  Cosmetical changes aren't listed.

4.4. Basic Discography/Videography

     The album "Common Ground" is now out worldwide, Kate's song is called
     "Mn'a na Eireann".

[Wild speculation about release date replaced by facts. Track listing
deleted, go into a shop and buy it! (sorry for those in Australia and
New Zealand and other release date challenged people...)]

     Remaining officially published non-album and non-TWW items are:

     - Common Ground
       - Mn'a na Eireann

[New entry for Mn'a na H-Eireann - and a new typo as well :-/ ]

     Cover versions of Kate's songs:

     Wuthering Heights
        China Drum
            - Wuthering Heights (ltd. ed. single)
            - Can't Stop These Things (single)
            - Goosefair (album) [BW, RP, SW, AT]
        Ataraxia - La fantasma dell'opera
            (called: "La nuova magerita", slightly different lyrics) [MD]

[One massively extended entry and one new entry]

     Books mentioning Kate Bush:
        (usually, these quotes are the only connection these books have to
        Kate, there are no other mentions or links from the story to her.)

     Terry Pratchett - Eric
        "Many people think it should have been a hydrogen molecule, but this
        is against the observed facts. Everyone who has found a hitherto
        unknown egg-whisk jamming an innocent kitchen drawer knows that raw
        matter is continually flowing into the universe in fairly developed
        forms, popping into existence normally in ashtrays, vases and glove
        compartments.  It chooses its shape to allay suspicion, and common
        manifestations are paperclips, the pins out of shirt packaging, the
        little keys for central heating radiators, marbles, bits of crayon,
        mysterious sections of herb-chopping devices and old Kate Bush
        albums. Why matter does this is unclear, but it is evident that
        matter has Plans."

     Rene Appel - The third person
        "... From the old poster, Kate Bush looked at her full of compassion.
        Girl what are you doing here with this old doll if life outside is
        luring. ..." [translated from (original) Dutch by EN]

[New sub-section - any other entries?]

Bye,

Uli
