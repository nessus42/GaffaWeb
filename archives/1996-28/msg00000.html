&gt;New age music? Well... Calling it "music" is  exaggerated. I mean the
&gt;original new age "music", the one linked with the new age movement, records
&gt;made for meditating and such things... The kind of record you can make by
&gt;randomly press the keyboard of any synthetiser and adding some choirs,
&gt;bells and one or two exotic sounding instruments. This is supposed to be a
&gt;relaxing stuff, but any music lover cannot listen it  more than a minute
&gt;without finding it really boring.

I don't agree with this.  I don't know what the definition of "music" is,
but what does it matter?  Regardless of whether someone like Kate puts a
lot of thought into her songs or whether they have been made by

"randomly press the keyboard of any synthetiser and adding some choirs,
bells and one or two exotic sounding instruments."


As long as it's great to listen too then so be it.  And I think most of
this stuff is great to listen to.  Besides, I'm sure these "new age" guys
put a lot more effort into their pieces than this.

See ya,
Dave

PS: Please don't take this as a flame, just an opinion

&gt;Anyways, the problem is that in a lot of records shops, when they don't
&gt;know how to classify a new music, they call it new age, especially if it's
&gt;a quiet music... So you can find a lot of different artists in the new age
&gt;section, though most of them don't consider themselves to deserve this
&gt;label (and they don't!). This happened for Enya, maybe because her music is
&gt;quite cool. And since a lot of new age noise makers inclued some celtic
&gt;influences on their works, I am afraid she will never get rid of this
&gt;stupid categorization. Luckily, as far as I know, nobody thought to put
&gt;Kate Bush's records in the new age section, but I am sure it could
&gt;happen... I saw once Mike Oldfield in it!
&gt; So, as "new age" is now given to very different kinds of musics, and not
&gt;only the muzak it was originally naming, this label doesn't really mean
&gt;anything...
