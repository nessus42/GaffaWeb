&gt; From meadley@cyan.UUCP Tue Jul 11 09:55:18 1989

&gt; Re-reading Kate's interview in January 1986 (Island-Ear 
&gt; Interview), Kate definately states "it is very much about
&gt; someone trying to make it through the night in the water -
&gt; alone, scared and not really knowing what's happening, but
&gt; going through the experience and hopefully coming out the 
&gt; 					     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; other side with an appreciation of what's *really* going on."
&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; This certainly suggests to me that the person DOES survive.

On the other hand, "coming out the other side" _could_ mean that 
the person in the water has died and is now in Heaven, or Nirvana, or "another
plane of existence" or whatever. 

Also, why did Kate say "someone _trying_ to make it through the night" 
(emphasis added) if she meant "someone making it through the night"? 
Granted this is a conversation and people aren't generally as careful in 
talking as they are in writing, but maybe this is some sort of Freudian slip.

If someone can point me to a Kate KuoTe that says "Oh yes, she survives and 
returns to her family a better person for the experience", or somesuch, then 
I shall admit defeat and never again even THINK that she drowns. Until then 
I shall stubornly maintain that the joyful sounds of John Williams guitar 
("The Morning Fog") is a metaphor for Angelic Harps and that our heroine does 
indeed die.

Sorry to hash this up again. Actually, it beats all this "Wait! I saw an 
episode of 'LA Law'" opinion of the day vis a vis copyright infringment stuff.
