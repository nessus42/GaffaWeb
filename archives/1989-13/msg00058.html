Well, everyone's favorite subject again rears its ugly head.  And this
time I'll bite.  While rather offended by IED's choice of words
("there are no two ways about it", "this is not a subject for debate",
"this is an ignorant reaction", "did _no-one_ learn anything..."), I'm
inclined to agree with his substantive view.  To which end I hereby
post some substantive replies to Kevin Gurney, who writes:

&gt;1. Is she physically "falling like a stone"?  Couldn't have been a very 
&gt;successful rescue if she is. How about emotionally "falling like a stone"? 
&gt;Doesn't really fit with the rest of the song, does it?  What if she's
&gt;"falling" through this world into another?  That makes sense to me.

What if she's in a nearly zero-g, or "free-fall", environment, such as
(for example) floating in water, especially salt water?  And a whole
night in the water, if one didn't freeze to death, would leave one's
sensory nerves about as responsive as a stone.


&gt;2. Why does she sing "I'd (I _would_) love to hold you now."?  Why not simply 
&gt;"I'll hold you now."? Unless she can't BECAUSE SHE'S DEAD!
Someone else handled this one pretty well.


&gt;3. The couplet "Being born again/Into the sweet morning fog" just sounds
&gt;too much like she's passed on to the next world. I can't think of any other
&gt;_plausible_ interpretation.

The ocean has been used as a metaphor for rebirth _within_this_life_
for thousands of years.  Nearly every ancient culture that dealt with
the sea had a "Jonah" story, as Joseph Campbell points out, emphasizing
that these legends indicate someone going through a traumatic
experience and coming out as a different person, with a feeling of
newness that could well be interpreted as "being born again",
especially if one's sensory inputs were screwed up.  I've experienced
something less intense, but similar, working all-nighters in the
terminal room and emerging from that dark hole into the 6AM light and
fog, which tends to make everything look new and half-formed.
