&gt; Now, I've got to figure out what to do about the guy who offered me a
&gt; cassette of KT's B-sides.  Does anyone know if this is a legitimate
&gt; release?  It has a white paper insert with hand-lettered track
&gt; identifications.  :-)

In article &lt;8907102120.AA04541@GAFFA.MIT.EDU&gt; Marvick wrote:
&gt;     Just exactly what planet is Tim living on? Since when did "legitimate"
&gt;releases come out with hand-lettered track-listings? Has Tim _ever_
&gt;seen any announcements in Love-Hounds or anywhere else about the official
&gt;release of a collection of Kate's b-sides? No! Once again, it seems to IED
&gt;that either Tim is the most naive consumer in modern history, or he's
&gt;being disingenuous--trying to justify acquiring bootleg KT products while
&gt;simultaneously claiming ignorance, meanwhile scolding others for their own
&gt;far more honest policy of admitting their helpless attraction to such products.

Since Marvick's own letter was full of personal attacks, I need not
scruple to point out that his own pretense and stupidity have once
again been his downfall.  My query was followed by the classic USENET
smiley-face symbol, :-), indicating that it was a joke.  This fact
would have been evident to even the dullest of intellects, even without
the symbolic reminder, but not, it seems, to Marvick, whose capacity
for outrage so greatly outstrips his capacity for thought.

Since the rest of his typically long-winded and flatulent posting is at
the same microcephalic level, I see no reason to respond to it in
full.  (Or should I really explain in full the meaning of an idiom like
"Kate can't dance", explaining as if to a child that it does not mean
she can't pick up her feet, but that she is lacking the talent
generally considered neccessary to a professional performer?  What
would be the point of responding to such moronic drivel?)
