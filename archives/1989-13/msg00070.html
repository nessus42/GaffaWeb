 To: Love-Hounds
 From: IED (with Neil's help)
 Subject: _Cathy_Demos_--the "official" view; and KT NEWS

     Neil sent along the actual announcement printed in the latest
issue of _Homeground_, which pretty much acts as a Bush family mouth-
piece when called upon to do so.

  HOMEGROUND feels that it should be said, in view of possible legal
  actions pending, that these tapes are highly illegal, and that
  copying and distribution, even amongst friends and not for gain is
  still illegal. Kate herself is highly upset about these releases.

     IED agrees with Neil that this notice is meant more to try to
discourage people from making the tapes, and not as a promise that
actual legal action will be taken. Such action would probably be
counter-productive from EMI's and Kate's point of view, though of
course one never knows for sure. However, IED is taking the notice
very seriously, and at this point he must say the tape deal looks
doubtful. Final decision still pending, but L-Hs will know ASAP.

KT NEWS:
     In more _good_ KT news: A project which was originally announced
in the trade papers more than a year ago, and subsequently said to
have been scrapped, has now been re-activated (info again courtesy of
Neil). The project in question is a comilation album of songs written
by the songwriting team of Elton John and Bernie Taupin, as covered
in new recordings by a variety of artists. The occasion was originally
to have been the twentieth anniversary of the John-Taupin partnership,
though that now may be an obsolete excuse for the album.
     In any event, when the project was first announced, Kate Bush
was slated to record a cover version of _Rocket_Man_ for the album,
and that now appears to be on again.
