 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: _K_T_ _N_E_W_S_: the good and the bad

     IED has this information from Love-Hounds's Chief British
KorrespondenT, Neil Calton, who relays the information straight
from the 35th and latest issue of _Homeground_. Part of the
information is good, and part is bad.
     First, the good: We now know the _title_ of the new album!
It is: _The_Sensual_World_.
     Also good: the date which IED announced three weeks ago
has been confirmed: the album will be released this September,
and the first single will be in shops in _mid-August_!
That's only _four_weeks_from_now_!
     Second, the not-so-good: In the same issue, Peter apparently
specifically warns against _anyone_ making copies of the
so-called _Cathy_Demos_--_even_ if they are only being made
for friends. Peter stresses that to do so is very illegal.
Presumably this notice was published at the request of the
Bush family. And it sounds to IED as though they have Love-Hounds
in mind.
     What this means is that IED is now more doubtful than ever
about carrying out our plan. He must warn everyone that he is now
leaning against the idea of making copies for anyone. This is not
a firm decision, but he does hope that you will understand
the delay--IED wants to wait at least until he has received
his subscription copy of _Homeground_ from Peter, just in
case it is accompanied by a letter (which would be a reply to
IED's own letter to him, in which IED discussed his acquisition
of the demos). Please, people, bear with IED for just a
little while longer--he doesn't like keeping anyone waiting,
especially under these circumstances, and knowing how
much some of you are counting on your little packages. He
promises to make a final and irrevocable decision within
one week (i.e. by July 23).
     He should add that if he decides not to go through
with the tape deal, but to return everyone's orders, he will
not hold it against anyone if they should decide to curse
IED, disparage his parents, and generally heap vitriol on
his name. If such should happen, he would accept the rebukes
in silent humility. There is no real doubt that he has made
a total ass of himself in this non-starter of a project,
despite the fact that he never intended to do anything but
good for everyone in this group. Again, he offers his
apologies.
     In the meantime, _please_ don't go spreading the word
about this whole tape fiasco outside Love-Hounds. The last
thing IED wants now is for the wrong people to hear about
it, or to start getting orders from people oustide the
Love-Hounds community.
     To return on the up-note which began this posting, IED
feels it is worth mentioning that the term "The Sensual World",
which _Homeground_ reports is to be the title of Kate Bush's
sixth studio album, is also the title of a series of twenty-four
books by the English writer Rupert Croft-Cooke (born in 1903,
still living, to IED's latest information). If this should
turn out to be a deliberate reference, and not simply a
co-incidence (and the latter is _not_ likely, given the
thoroughness with which Kate plans things like titles), it
will put a very intriguing new twist on Kate's ideological
and aesthetic path.
