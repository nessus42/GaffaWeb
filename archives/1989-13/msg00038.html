kurtzman@pollux.usc.edu asks:

&gt; Now for a real controversial question: Why do people on this net worship
&gt; this woman. I'll grant that she writes interesting music and poetry, and
&gt; that she is attractive, but seriously, why all the dedication?

You mean "why all the dediKaTion?", don't you?

But seriously, as the biggest (ie looniest) KaTe fan at my place o' employment
I am asked this question a lot, usually just after "Why is your machine named
'gaffa'?", "Who is the woman in all the posters on your wall?", and "Are
you going to England again?" (just kidding about the last one).

KaTe is the only pop figure I've ever idolized. I don't like the term 
"worship", because its more religious connotations are also important to me.  

So why the idolization? Well, for me, her physical beauty and sensuality are 
very strong attractors, but that's not why I'm so infatuated with her. The
fact that she's a good poet and singer are also things that I consider "neat"
to "great", but these aren't why I'd give my spleen to work with her either.

The primary reason I'm infatuated with Kate is because of her skill as a 
songwriter/musician/producer. I'm a musician myself (cello) and hearing
Kate's detailed and spirited music just sends shivers up my spine. Her music
isn't just "good" to my ears, it's important that I hear it and important
that it be heard by everyone who cares about the craft of music. 

She's also a real musical morale booster, in the sense that her music has 
evolved and she's explored such new territory in such a short time (although 
it DOES seem to be an un-naturally slow process when you're waiting for KBVI). 
If she can make these wonderul sounds, perhaps my own writing and performance 
can achieve something similar. 

I guess you could say that I look at Kate as a sort of mentor.

Well, that's enough blather from me. What about other folks out there? Why
all the dediKaTion to Kate?
