&gt;Let's move on to something more concrete.  Like, for instance, at the
&gt;end of THE WALL, does Pink die?

Quoted-From: tlh@PacBell.COM (Lee Hounshell)
&gt;Actually, at the end of THE WALL, everything starts over again.  If you
&gt;listen very carfully to the last two seconds of the end of the second disk,
&gt;you will hear "Isn't this where.."  and then the first two seconds of the
&gt;first disk has "I came in?"

Yeah, everybody knows that.  That's why I asked if he dies.  The first
side begins with him getting born, so there would seem to be some sort
of cyclic view of rebirth expressed here.  This seems a bit mystical
for Waters, but then, the old wheel of life is traditionally supposed
to be a sort of spiritual trap from which one ought to escape, and
that fits in with the fatalistic theme of the album.

&gt;So looking at the loop objectively, I'd have
&gt;to say "No, Pink doesn't die.  He just gets caught in a time warp.  :-)"

Yeah, that's it, there's this spinning black hole outside the wall,
see, and he gets sucked in, (falling, like a stone) and emerges back at
the start of the album.  he's thrown out of the delivery room and
turned over to the police, who put him behind a new wall.  On release,
he becomes a schoolteacher, and....

Have you met my wife, Morgan Fairchild?
