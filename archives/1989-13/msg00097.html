 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick
 Subject: _The_Sensual_United_States_

     Well, earlier Love-Hounds reports of a delayed release of Kate's
new album in the U.S. have been confirmed by IED in L.A., too:
_The_Sensual_World_ has been given an October 17th in-store date
by the Hollywood publicity office of CBS Records. No word on when
the single (which will have the same title as the album) is due in
the U.S.--or even if that will _be_ the single that CBS puts out.
     IED must say that Kate's decision to switch to CBS is hard
to understand--the company has a very poor history when it comes
to promoting challenging artists in the U.S., and they very rarely
do anything beyond the ordinary in the way of advertising campaigns.
Now the news that they aren't even going to plan a simultaneous
release with EMI (which retains control over the album's release
throughout the rest of the world) adds more reason for us to worry.
The fact is, EMI-America did a remarkably good job of promoting
_Hounds_of_Love_, at least compared to the typical rock album.
Limited-edition color-vinyl LPs and cassettes, a very wide-spread
print-ad program, a ton of posters (at least in this town), and
even some success getting the videos aired. Sure, it could have
been a lot better, but IED shudders to think what CBS will do (or
not do) to promote _The_Sensual_World_--especially when he considers
how extremely important it is that this album sell well, if there is
to be _any_ chance of luring Kate into a U.S. tour within the next
eighteen months.
     Ah, well. There is at least one silver lining--when a new album
is delayed domestically, it puts more pressure on independent record
stores to get in the imports to cover the gap. Thus our chances are
increased of getting hold of the import CD-singles, 12"s and even
cassettes before the (inevitably poor-quality) U.S. versions start
clogging up the works.
