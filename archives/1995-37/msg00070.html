&gt;Hi Lovehounds!
&gt;
&gt;I thought Heather Nova was going to be my "Find Of The Year" but now Stina
&gt;Nordenstam might usurp HN's position on my list.
&gt;
&gt;WHO IS STINA?
&gt;
&gt;I have no idea. Apparently she is Swedish. Apparently she has 2 albums, of
&gt;which I have the second, "And She Closed Her Eyes". She writes and arranges
&gt;all of her songs on this album. "And She Closed Her Eyes" was released in
&gt;the US in 1994, and it was preceded by "Memories of a Color" in 1993. If
&gt;any of you Swedish Lovehounds have any information about her, please send
&gt;it to totoro@charm.net. As far as I can tell, she doesn't even have an
&gt;unofficial homepage on the WWW.
&gt;
&gt;WHAT DOES STINA LOOK LIKE?
&gt;
&gt;She has short dark hair and a big forehead. The sleeve photo of her shows
&gt;her standing in front of an old wooden warehouse or something. She is
&gt;wearing a high-collared blue coat that looks like a spacesuit. She has her
&gt;eyes closed and one hand held up to her temple, like she is receiving a
&gt;telepathic message. The CD booklet, which contains all of her lyrics (she
&gt;sings in English), shows many enigmatic pictures of her. Some are out of
&gt;focus, some are from funny angles. None of them show her with her eyes
&gt;open, except for the last one, a tiny full-figure shot on the back cover.
&gt;She's wearing the same blue coat and a little blue skirt. Blue socks
&gt;bunched down around her ankles; white high-top sneakers. The picture is so
&gt;small you're not sure if her eyes are open or not. She is holding both
&gt;hands up to her head, as if she was the model for Munch's "The Scream". She
&gt;is not screaming.
&gt;
&gt;WHAT DOES STINA SOUND LIKE?
&gt;
&gt;Amazing! Unique! Original! She has a whispering little-girl voice that
&gt;sounds a little clipped, mixed very loud in relation to the instruments.
&gt;The effect is like a very intimate one-way conversation with a telepathic
&gt;alien poet who is very, very far away. None of the songs really rock. They
&gt;have a kind of lullaby quality that might make them good for twirly dancing
&gt;with your baby. Some jazzy arrangements with trumpets and saxes. The lyrics
&gt;are very mysterious...I think one song is about the singer recognizing a
&gt;terrorist/bomber from the way he walks across a street. A lot of the songs
&gt;have something familiar...I can say, "This is her Bel Canto song, this is
&gt;her Bjork song, this is her Kate Bush song, this is her Astrud Gilberto (!)
&gt;song, etc." However, her voice and singing style sets her very far apart
&gt;from any of these artists. She has a Stina sound even more than Victoria
&gt;Williams has a Victoria Williams sound, if you know what I mean. Stina's
&gt;music is very soothing for me, though. The arrangements are very
&gt;sophisticated although at first they sound very simple and Shawn Colvin-y.

Hi Lovehounds!

I thought Heather Nova was going to be my "Find Of The Year" but now Stina
Nordenstam might usurp HN's position on my list.

WHO IS STINA?

which I have the second, "And She Closed Her Eyes". She writes and arranges
all of her songs on this album. "And She Closed Her Eyes" was released in
the US in 1994, and it was preceded by "Memories of a Color" in 1993. If
any of you Swedish Lovehounds have any information about her, please send
it to totoro@charm.net. As far as I can tell, she doesn't even have an
unofficial homepage on the WWW.

She has short dark hair and a big forehead. The sleeve photo of her shows
her standing in front of an old wooden warehouse or something. She is
wearing a high-collared blue coat that looks like a spacesuit. She has her
eyes closed and one hand held up to her temple, like she is receiving a
