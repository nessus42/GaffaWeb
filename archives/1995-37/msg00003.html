lately, there's been a lot of discussion on here about bootlegs.  Kate 
knight seems to think that buying bootlegs is an awful thing to do, and a 
lot of other people think it's too bad that Kate isn't getting any money 
from people buying her bootlegs.

i dunno, i don't see anything really wrong with it.  she's not losing 
money - i'm sure all of us have already bought all the legit releases we 
could find before going on to bootlegs - and i think it's a good way to 
hear her home demos.  that's the only way, really...even if she wanted 
to release her demos to a wider audience, do you think EMI would go for 
it?  prolly not.

her live bootlegs, IMHO, are perfectly all right also.  because that's 
the only way to hear her live (besides the hammersmith-odeon show, which 
is now on official release - so yes, buying a bootlegged hammersmith show 
is stupid, because it's widely availible).  in fact, her other shows 
(like the tv special w/peter gabriel and appearances like SNL and Comic 
Relief) are a real treat to hear - and it's only availible on bootleg 
form.  i'm sure she doesn't *not* want her fans to hear this stuff.  
otherwise, she wouldn't have performed it in the first place, right?

and i don't think buying bootlegs violates her control over her 
material.  because by buying her unreleased stuff, we're not *exploiting* 
it.  we're *appreciating* it.  so far, she hasn't said anything about not 
approving of bootlegs (at least, i don't think so), and she must be aware 
of the amount there are.  i don't think she cares.  if i were a famous 
musician, i think it'd be neat if people were actually buying bootlegs of 
some of my stuff.  of course, i'm not Kate, but still....

any new guesses on the release for her next album, with the rumours 
starting on her recording?  at this rate, Tori'll soon have more albums 
than Kate!

until next time...
