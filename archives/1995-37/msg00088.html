How about the following silly article:

11/25/95 - Spinning brings new format, new attitude to riding stationary bikes

Spinning, the newest fitness fad to reach health clubs, is all about _ drum 
roll, please _ riding stationary bicycles!   So what's new about that?  Plenty. 
New bike, new format, new attitude.  

Dreamed up by an endurance cyclist and martial arts master, spinning is  
supposed to make you feel like you're on the open road. Or a mountain path. Or a 
racing route.  All this while you're spinning your wheels with a bunch of other 
people in a gym, listening to music, led by an instructor. Some classes are even 
conducted in candlelight.  

One sure sign that this isn't your ordinary health-club stationary bike workout: 
The bikes used for spinning, specially manufactured by Schwinn, don't have any 
of those pesky monitors to show you how lousy you're doing.  

Spinning's creator, Johnny G. (short for Goldberg), is a cyclist who blamed a 
lack of mental focus on his poor performance in a bike race. To practice, he 
designed his own stationary bicycle and began listening to music while he 
pedaled, borrowing from his martial arts training for visualization and 
breathing techniques.  

Johnny G. began selling his concept in L.A. in 1989. It became popular there and 
in New York. This year, instructors began branching out to health clubs 
elsewhere in the United States and in Australia and Western Europe.  Clubs that 
want to offer spinning have to put their staff through special training: a 
weekend training session, followed by nine months during which they have to 
follow a set workout plan in their classes.  

(Exercycle fluff deleted to spare you!)

The music varies. Latham played everything from Tina Turner to the Beatles to 
John Tesh. One class will have older participants spinning to Glenn Miller 
tunes.  In his preview class Friday at Club Body Tech, instructor Evan Perry 
played Charlie Parker, Peter Gabriel, KATE BUSH, and weirdsters Dead Can Dance. 
The music is important, he says: ""It evokes a mood and a feeling that allows 
you to work really hard, and be relaxed and enjoy yourself at the same time.""  

On a separate topic, Sarah McLaughlin's "Freedom Sessions" CD-Rom went gold.  
Also a phone number for Sony Interactive Entertainment: 213-833-8100.  Shall we 
request Kate?
