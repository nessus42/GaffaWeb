More on How to become a Katective:
Fom IED (who never sleeps) on June '86:

"Frank brings up another extremely interesting point about the barely
audible details in "Watching You Without Me", on which I think I can shed
some light. At the very beginning, two male voices can be heard speaking.
After many fruitless listenings, it suddenly hit me what was going on. If
you count along with the beat from the very first down-beat of the
recording, voicing only the first beat of each bar (that is, voicing ONE
{two-three-four} TWO {two-three-four}, etc.) up to eight -- the length of
the rhythmic introduction of the song -- you will then have the solution.
Almost immediately you'll hear one musician ask "What's that?" He means,
"What bar is that?" Then, at bar four, that same musician calls out "four"
-- but he calls it out on the third, rather than the first beat of that 
bar. Another musician then confirms the beat, on the FIRST beat of bar
five. Following this, you can hear them counting out the first beats of
bars six, seven and eight in unison. This was probably recorded quite early
on in the rehearsals, and probably at the original "demo" stage of
recording. However, knowing Kate's perfectionism, and the classic character
of this exchange, it's just possible that it was actually a staged
re-recording of an incident similar to many that must have occurred during
the original demo stages of the recording."

It's there! But you have to listen at high volume! 

Best wishes
