Hi all,

Various folks combined now have this song to be the following but I'll
put in what I hear (hopefully obviously, mine have the ***'s):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scares Me Silly

	Here in the studio,
	As they're turning down the lights,
	I lick my lips to start the first line -
	How come they're scolding me?
	"Well, little thing, ah, you're looking lost!"
	The birdy goes and me too...

		Ooh, ooh...
		They try to hit me and the tapes begin to spin.
***		The "china" video tape begins to spin
Obviously, "china" does not fit, but maybe with the word "video" someone
will hear the previous word, I just don't think it's "try to hit me".
		I feel a little sick and hope my notes are in
		I try to put it on it, do it for you.
		Don't even know you but I need you to love me, too.
		They try to hit me and the tapes begin to spin.
*** same again using "video tape"
		I feel a little sick and hope my notes are in
		I try to put it on it, do it for you.
		Don't even know you but I need you to love me, too.

			Scares me silly, but it gets me going,
			Like a Romeo.
			Scares me silly, but it gets me going,
			Like a Romeo.
			Scares me silly, but it gets me going.

	Swimming amid the cabs,
***	Singing amid the cans
ie "cans" as in headphones.
	I wonder can I gull myself into another take,
***		       goad
	And keep the mood?
	It's like a music balance.
	I close my eyes to cello solo,
	And hate/aid [?] the music.
***	    make
	Don't ever let me go away.

		You,
		You know the feeling when you're on the right track.
		You fall in love and you're never gonna turn it back.
		------------------------------
***		You're so popular, they're so sensitive
		------------------------------
***		Losing without me, brimming over with secrets.
		You know the feeling when you're on the right track.
		You fall in love and you're never gonna turn it back.
		------------------------------
*** same	You're so popular, they're so sensitive
		------------------------------
*** same	Losing without me, brimming over with secrets.

			Scares me silly, but it gets me going,
			Like a Romeo.
			Scares me silly, but it gets me going,
			Like a Romeo.
			Scares me silly, but it gets me going.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; I don't remember where I've got them (The Garden probably), but if
&gt; anyone has any ideas about the missing parts, speak up!

I think I'm 90% correct for the blank lines.
Some words being a little hard to get, if you've heard this track, you'll
understand this understatement!
