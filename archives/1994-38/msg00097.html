Hello fellow Hounders

I've not written to the list before, and have only been a member for a week 
or so. Apologies if this is a repeat thread.

Flame on...
I'd be interested to hear Hounders' reaction to me saying that the US mix 
of Rubberband Girl (as featured on the CD single of ASIL) is _much_ more, 
shall I say, commercial than the version we had over here (in UK). I had 
already seen the US video (which again was much better than the feeble 
effort we saw), and I can't understand why they bothered to release the UK 
(European?) version. Don't you agree that the US cut would have done much 
better over here? Perhaps someone in the US can tell me where RG got in the 
Billboard? probably did better than here...
By the way, I did think that the US mix of Eat the Music was _boring_!!
Flame off...

On a positive note, nice to see ASIL jump straight into the UK charts at 
number 26... but will it go further? Not if it's to be based on Kate's 
"performance" on TOTP (as reviewed by others already).

Now, I place my cap in hand, and ask if anyone can point me towards a store 
that might still have some of those fabulous (!) 7" special edition picture 
disks (with poster, of course) that I can't get hold of. Believe me, I've 
tried everything over the last few weeks...

Cheerio for now.
-Jo
