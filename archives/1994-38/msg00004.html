&gt;i just finished vamps and tramps and am rereading sex art and american culture

&gt;trouble all the time for thinking for myself.

	Does part of that "thinking for yourself" include a rejection of
normal capitalization?  :-)  I'm unable to whether you are majoring in 
Women's Studies or in Queer studies (or both), but I find it very ironic 
that you call Paglia a godsend and yet express surprise that you "get
into trouble" for grating against the norm in Women's/Queer Studies.  
After all, Paglia insists that Women's Studies and Queer Studies programs
are the *most* lockstep-PC places that you can find in a university and
feels that they should not exist whatsoever. 


&gt;anyway, i want to send camille a mix tape of kate stuff. she is a big pop
&gt;culture conneissure (sp?) but i dont know that she probably knows a lot of
&gt;kates stuff, even though it would be up her alley. 


	Frankly, I don't think Paglia's likely to find Kate all that i
interesting.  She'd probably find the literarily-based songs to be kind
of fun and she might even find some of the music to be vaguely good, but 
I just can't imagine that she'd find Kate interesting as a pop icon.
Yeah, Kate sings about sex on songs like "Feel It," "Symphony in Blue,"
etc., but she's still probably pretty boring by Paglia's standards.
Paglia's into pop figures who are bold, brash, and shamelessly self-
promoting--  people like Elvis, Madonna, Glennda Orgasm, and (I might add)
herself--  and who readily submit to her "Women are Dionysian, Men are
Apollonian" theory of art and culture.  The musician you were talking 
about in your last post (Ani DeFranco) would be *much* more up her alley
than Kate would, IMHO.
