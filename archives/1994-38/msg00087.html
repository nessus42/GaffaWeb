&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The question that I have been wanting to ask is....Will someone please explain
&gt; &gt;to me Kate's reluctance to tour? I think this question was addressed many weeks
&gt; &gt;ago with the improbable excuse that she was/is busy. I find it difficult to
&gt; &gt;believe that a human being could be THAT busy. It's not like she's in the
&gt; &gt;studio grinding out albums. Heck, even a multi-project slowpoke perfectionist
&gt; &gt;like Peter Gabriel manages to squeeze a few concerts in each decade. Will I
&gt; &gt;live and die without ever seeing Kate perform live?
&gt; 
&gt; Believe me, KaTe is much more of a perfectionist then anyone else around.
&gt; I've also heard in some interview that she's really scared about touring
&gt; since she hasn't in so long.
&gt; 
&gt; 
I heard an interview on BBC Radio 1 a week or two ago, where Kate was asked
if she was ever going to tour again. She said:

  "I would like to. I think lots of people think I didn't enjoy the tour
  because I haven't done one since. But actually I really did. But I
  suppose I just got so wrapped up in studio work, and the more I don't
  tour, the more I become nervous of it. But I would very much like to do 
  some shows sometime.

  I did enjoy making the film (TLTC&amp;TC) very much and I really learnt a lot,
  and all the people I worked with were fantastic. It was a great experience.
  But in a way I've got that out of my system for now, and to make another
  film I think I'd have to put a lot of work in which, in some ways that film 
  was a little too rushed. And I guess, you know, if I do get a chance to 
  move away from records again, it would be nice to try and do some shows."


If anyone's *really* interested, I've got a transcript of the entire interview
(about 150 lines) including Kates attempt at a joke about dolphins. I also
have it on tape, of course.
