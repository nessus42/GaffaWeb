Like, go out and buy "CHAINS CHANGED" (4AD) by Throwing Muses.  Like,
it's just, like, way cool.  Four songs for $6, and the only one I'm not
ultimately thrilled with is "Reel" (written by Tanya Donelly, writer of
"Green", their super-smash hit).  "Finished" is like any of the best songs
from the first LP, "Snail Head" has a VERY heavy country influence (I think)
and "Cry Baby Cry" is probably their most "pop" song to date, with non-sur-
realistic lyrics, verse-chorus-verse style, and a real melody line.   All
the songs have quick tempos, and there's no pulling punches in terms of
energy level.  Like, a good deal.  Can't wait for the second album this fall.

They're playing Brown?  Good.  How do I get there?


OTHER NEWS:

Was watching MTV last night as I was rewinding a videotape (more on that in
a sec) and they had a report on the XTC song "Dear God".  Seems as though
the song has really caught on in certain areas on top-40 stations, but
there have been threats, bomb scares, and lots of protest at the song and
the stations that play it in the Bible Belt, specifically Texas and Florida.
Andy Partridge was quoted as saying that the song "is neither an affirmation
nor a denial of God".  MTV says "we're hoping for a hit single with this one".


If any of you happen to notice a tv listing for a show on PBS called "New
Television", watch it.  The premeire show is an hour-and-a-half semi-documen-
tary on British choreographer Michael Clark, and is full of some intense
"punk" (as they call it) choreography set to the music of The Fall.   In fact,
in the middle of it, Mark E. Smith and Brix Smith appear with Clark and talk
about western civilisation.  It's WEIRD but good.  I can't remember the title
exactly, something with "Titan" in it, I think... some mythological reference.


Das is all.
