&gt;Subject: locust abortion technician

&gt;If you were ever worried about the Butthole Surfers mellowing out in
&gt;their old (?) age, buy Locust Abortion Technicians and be reassured
&gt;that this band is too zany to sell/mellow out. Standard Buttholes

I think the materiel on that album was stuff recorded a coupla years
ago when they were living in Athens tormenting M. Stipe.

New Conflict is out w/ a White Zombie and Das Damen int. (howze that for
bands you'll never listen to, Phil, you lame, tightass chickenfuck...).
Send 1.50 for Conflict 44, 62 ave c #3, NYC, NY  10009.  Also chronicles
the latest exploits of GG Allin (lead offensive god in case you don't
know, Phil, and,  no,  he doesn't sing with three black backup singers).  Also, 
Hogge, this guy don't like Gutbank.   Estatic Shredded Slime review in 
which he maintains that the Psycodrama piece puts every rock interview
he's read in the last few year to shame...
 
Here's some news blatently ripped off - - - 
Pussy Galore signed to Caroline Records.  New release forthcoming.  Pussy
Galore (for Phil's edification) is a band that's been drawing alot of
criticism (supposedly from Lydia Lunch) for imitating the NYC washed-up
and dried-out "No Wave" scene of a coupla years back.  Also, new 1/2
Jap LP coming out soon (on Irridescense, of course).  1/2 Japanese
is yet another band that deserves godhood status and blows too many
bands and artists out of the pond to shake an typical major label A &amp; R
man's bankbook at. Sorry, Phil, as of yet, um 1/2 Jap haven't developed
any "mystical storytelling" that I can think of and we all know that
that's about all there is to any "good" music I can think of...
Live Skull has just finished a new EP with former
Uzi vocalist contributing.(listening, nessus?) New MEKONs records out soon
on Twin/Tone called "Mekons Honkytonking".......  Big Time have
signed the Fall in the U.S. as well as The Pastels.  Salem 66 looking
for new drummer (617-367-1354).... MENTORS on tour.  Coming to
DC this Thursday (at the Hung Jury Pub, Phil).... Robyn Hitchcock's
record label has supposedly ruled that any fanzine doing an interview
with Robyn MUST put him on the cover....Steve Albini news - releasing
a bass-only collab rec with Couch Flambeau's Jay Tiller called the
Army, an upcoming Spider Baby EP with some of Pussy Galore's people and
BIG BLACK is rumored to split up in September and Albini turned down
Jim Foetus's offer to "jam"... The Ex to tour america in May...  Wire
getting ready to tour also.... Next week, we'll try and figure out
why I capitalize some band names and not others....

Latest ND is out from Austin Texas.  #8 has interviews
with F/i and Controlled Bleeding (two more bands that Phil hasn't heard of)
and should make Bill Hsu happy at the very least.  Also, Big City Orchestra,
John Duncan and Stride plus articles galore with such interesting
names as "history of unheard music" and "mail art congress" POB 4144, Austin, 
TX, 78765.  I'd reccommend sending some dough (2$ oughta do it).  Comes in
fine print=style format.

finally caught up with "Blue Velvet" and can't see what the fuss is.  
I mean, this IS one of the best "DETECTIVE" flicks I've ever seen, I'll
admit and it does go beyond the genre in much the way, say, "The Third
Man" did but all the hoopla generated by the typical Urban Newsweekly
Rags and such was undeserved to this mind.  Still, includes one of
the finest characterizations of a psycopath (and lots of mirror 
imaging between the protaganist (jeffrey) and this loony tune) I've
seen since, well, just since.  However, I don't think this is 
any bit of the high art the shrill syncophants were chiming about last
Novemeber.  Hell, the color doesn't even approach the best of the
Japanese films ('cept for the opening and closing scenes).

And that's all for today's comments on 20th century culture, late 80's...

P.S. to Phil Stephens ... tell me, do you really want us to hand
hold you through all this music you've already developed a closed
mind to?  I, personally, see it as a waste of my time.  Go waste
someone else's time, bud.  I got no need to get into a histronics
battle with some old fart.
