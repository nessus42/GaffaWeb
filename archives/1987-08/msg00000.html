I heard a rumor the other day that...
&gt;Really-From: prs@oliven.ATC.OLIVETTI.COM (Philip Stephens)
&gt;&gt;Really-From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu
&gt;&gt;KT News:
&gt;...
&gt;And many thanks for the list, I had no idea it would be so long.  I
&gt;assume the accessable instances are:
&gt;
&gt;(lp's)
&gt;&gt;Peter Gabriel, on "Don't Give Up", from 1986 LP So;
&gt;&gt;Big Country, on "The Seer", from 1986 LP The Seer;

An odd thing that these two pieces should be listed next to each other;
in each, I'd say that Kate's part carries the actual message, although this
is accomplished in "the Seer" by mixing her into the right channel while
Stuart Adamson moves to the left.  And the minor detail that for the
most part, she sings harmony.  Does this seem reasonable, or patently
ridiculous?  And indicate in your replies if you're right- or left-
handed/eared/whatever.  I'm curious.

&gt;&gt;&gt;...anyone else of similar caliber? (no, I'm not interested in musical
&gt;&gt;&gt;terrorists and intentionally offensive superpunks, thanks.  Don't they
&gt;&gt;&gt;deserve a seperate mod group for their equally offensive fans to hang
&gt;&gt;&gt;out in???? I'm tired of them trying to slamdance my sensibilities).
&gt;&gt;&gt;-- Phil        prs@oliveb.UUCP (Phil Stephens)     {really oliven}
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Sorry, this is where IED gets off, Phil. He doesn't share your
&gt;&gt;antagonism for "superpunks", or for things counter-culture, alternative
&gt;&gt;or subversive in general; quite the opposite, if anything.
&gt;
&gt;Actually, I overspoke.  I'm only rarely actually offended by them; 99%
&gt;of the time I'm simply bored with them...
&gt;... Really, I'm all for satire and political
&gt;offensiveness, but what little punk I've heard on college stations etc
&gt;sounds **dumb** to me.  I can't really comment on 95% of whats being discussed
&gt;since I haven't heard it and am not willing to spend dozens of dollars on
&gt;stuff I probably won't like just to hear it.

A pity.  Unlike studies of caches and disk storage mechanisms, there
is nothing that suggests that a "best fit" or "worst fit" algorithm is
particularly beneficial to the developing musical mind.  If you only
listened to music of obvious `greatness' handed to you on a silver
platter, you should tune a walkman to your local top-40 station and
glue it to your head.  Go on, experiment.  A little randomness
won't hurt you...well, not permanently, anyway.  Why else would we be
here discussing Kate?  I didn't think much of her music at first
hearing, but her technique set those first hooks.  Whatever you end up
getting, think of the music as raw coffee beans and your brain as the
world's greatest espresso machine.  Heh heh.

On the other hand, if you're worried about such an obsession digging
too dearly into your wallet, run!  Give up music!  I'm usually teetering
on the brink of financial disaster, and the little upshift light on my
CD buying meter is blinking again.  What's a poor student to do?

&gt;... maybe I should look at my record collection for a
&gt;more representitive list, these aren't quite it...
&gt;
&gt;An additional reason for asking is that I plan to learn keyboard and then
&gt;spend $1100 to $3000 on a sampling synthesizer, and it wouldn't hurt to
&gt;broaden my musical influences a tad while I'm groping around for what I
&gt;want to create myself.  Uhh... don't expect me to be going public with
&gt;the results any time soon, I want to amuse myself first, and might not
&gt;get good enough to subject others to.  As for my voice, well I've heard
&gt;worse, but...
&gt;...
&gt;	- Phil		prs@oliveb.UUCP (Phil Stephens)     {really oliven}

I guess this would be a good time to admit that I'll listen to
practically anything once.  Maybe twice.  A list of my favorite albums
just doesn't exist, so I'll pick some items off the top of my head that
I'd feel like listening to now:  Synergy (Metro. Suite, but only if
I kill all that high frequency noise), KT (no comment), the Sheffield
Track Record, U2 (still running the total immersion test on the Joshua
Tree), the Residents (just learning to like their "work"?!), J-M Jarre
(Rendezvous), Saint-Saens (Symphony No. 3 "Organ", Danse Macabre),
Jennifer Warnes (Famous Blue Raincoat), andeverypossibleperformanceof
Brahms'PianoConcerti1&amp;2exceptforRudolph"wheeeeze"Serkin'sthatIcanfind
inthenextfifteenminutes.  Throw in the despised (well gosh, _I_ despise
him, anyway) W.A. Mozart's Symphony No. 40, and I guess a little Don
Giovanni too.

You think this makes for ridiculous reading?  I just typed it in and
can't believe that I'm trying to think on the amount of sleep I'm
running on.  I'd ask something about what makes for a worse voice (I mean,
one that sounds like me?), but I'm just too...too...zzzzzzzzzzzzzz

p.s. About this new tone of complete reconciliation and general
emotional tippytoeing in this group...it's gotta go.  How else are we
to convince the outside world (read: net) that this isn't just another
mutual appreciation society?  So howabout it, guys?  Maybe the dynamic
duo at NRL can revert to their old personalities on, say, Thursdays?
Once in a while, it helps to remove the "analysis" from "critical
analysis", eh?

Can anyone confirm this?
