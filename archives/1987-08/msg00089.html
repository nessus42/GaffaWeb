Um. Okay.  While making a tape for Bill Hsu, I found the original copy
of Nihilius Fililius and have promised to get around making a more 
updated one.  I also should note that I lost the request from one
earnest cum-hound in Texas (they HAVE kate bush fans out thar?) and
if he would PULEEZE write me back (e-mail or the mail drop at the end
of this posting), I'll be sure he gets something post-haste.  I also
have something for a fellow in Neptune NJ ready to go out.  Mr. Stephens,
if you want a copy - please send a tape and return postage (or 3$ and
about 56 cents in stamps) to the address below.  By the way, I had 
alot of fun with Bill's tape, 2nd side (the first was a Sonic Youth
bootleg).  It starts off with sONICHOSE encoring (from side one) on
"The Red And Black" and goes into two cuts from a group called "Mornois",
one of which ("I-Yi!") sounds like a Japanese exercise class and the
other is called "roofing nails" (this comes by way of the folks at
RRR).  Next I add an ambient piece called appropriately "New Age Sucks"
done in my basment at a spur of the moment/movement.  This leads into
the GREATEST NEW AGE INDUSTRIAL BAND IN THE WORLD WHEN THEY WANT TO
BE, The Greatful Dead doing a space jam from, um, sometime in the
summer of 85 over at Beserkeley (complete with digitially sampled running brooks and a spirit whispering "daaadddy").  Then, we drop in on the Hitchhikers
Guide to The Galaxy as Ford Prefect predicts the end of the world to
an incredulous John Cleese ("oh, yes, the end of the world, right you
are, sir") Bartender.  Then, zoom... we're at the crucifiction of Christ
from Tim Rice and next we are listening to a modern day Christ, Henry
Rollins finishing up his poetry set ("So, I said to the waitress with
the U2 shirt, `Did you hear Bono died?'  Yeah, the singer from Black
Flag killed him") and the modern day Anti-Christ wannabe Tesco Vee
pitches his record down at the "Boy on Boy" disco.  This all leads
into a triumphant "Rema Rema" courtesy of Big Black and a disjointed
nightcap with the Fucking aka Sonic Youth singing/screaming/pissing
in their garden of earthly delights and killing a major league
rock critic with their "big fucking dicks".  Oh, damn... now I gave
it away.  But hey, WOULD YOU RATHER BE READING IED????
