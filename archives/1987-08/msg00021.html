I just realized that I actually squirrled away a transcription of the
Oblique Strategy cards when they appeared in net.music several ages
ago.  Here they are...  [Hi Rob!  Hey, did you see Thomas Dolby
perform live on the Joan Rivers show?]

OBLIQUE STRATEGIES
Over 100 worthwhile dilemmas by Brian Eno &amp; Peter Schmidt

These cards evolved from our separate observations of the principles
underlying what we were doing.  Sometimes they were recognized in retro-
spect (intellect catching up with intuition), sometimes they were formulated.
They can be used as a pack (a set of possibilities being continuously
reviewed in the mind) or by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack
when a dilemma occurs in a working situation.  In this case the card is
trusted even if its appropriateness is quite unclear.  They are not final,
as new ideas will present themselves, and others will become self-evident.
