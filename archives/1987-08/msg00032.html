After reading my last posting, and receiving some commentary from net-MIDI
types, I feel that I should further elaborate on the concept as a whole.
First, I do not think that it is necessary to have a direct MIDI to computer
to modem to net link in order to participate in this thing.  Although many
MIDI equiped people (and one would guess, especially people who happen to
also be involved with computers to the extent that they are on this net
at all) do have some MIDI-computer interface capability, be it a CZ-C64
set up up to a 20 KBD-Mac-MIDI with Mark of the Unicorn software setup, many
(probably for financial reasons, among others) don't.  Although it would be
somewhat time consuming, there is no reason (except for the work involved)
to actually 'word-process' a MIDI data stream on a standard text editor.
Note, that this requires defining each midi parameter for each note to be
contributed to the composition, however it isn't as difficult as it sounds
and maybe we could actually come up with some programs which would simplify
the process of creating an ASCII file.  Reflecting on the last 3 sentences,
one could take this thing even farther and assume no MIDI capability on
the part of the contributor at all (after all, the MIDI data standard of
using numbered chromatic piano keys, and 7 bit values corresponding to
pressure, velocity, volume , aftertouch, etc makes it directly ammenable
to creation of a stream without a MIDI device, as in transcription of
a music score, for example).  So in fact this should not exclude any person
who wants to participate in the project.

Second, the reason for using MIDI is to create the final layered composition.
It provides a notation standard which can be adapted to a number of uses, all
which will produce the expected results at the time of realization.  I will
volunteer my services as the co-ordinator of this thing and will dedicate some
hard disk space in my SDA-PROMIDI computer to it.  Essentially, this will 
allow for a rediculous number of overdubs, any off the wall quantization which
is necessary, and a convenient editing environment.  Final realization of the
composition (determined, of course, by what instruments are needed to actually
play it) is another matter, but SE Connecticut appears to be a MIDI rich
environment with a lot of cooperative musicians with mondo MIDI setups who I'm\
sure could be coerced into participating in this thing.  Anyway, I appreciate
the comments I've received so far.  I would still appreciate an answer to
the question about &lt;rec.music.synth&gt;.
