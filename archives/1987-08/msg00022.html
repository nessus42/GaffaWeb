&gt;Really-From: IED0DXM%UCLAMVS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu

&gt;IED, however, is highly skeptical that the song is a new
&gt;Kate Bush track, Sue. He's been burned before so many times
&gt;by third-hand accounts of new KT product
&gt;So, until he hears it himself, please don't be offended if he hesitates
&gt;to take your Katefan friend's word for it.

But it is true! It is it is it is! My friend has been a fan since
the very first, and is a fervent collector of Katiana! He would not
err. Besides, he told me the title and even I didn't recognize it...
but I'm *so* embarrassed, I forgot it! I promise -- I'll call him
tonight and get it!

This should make up for my little lapse, though, IED -- a brand-new
Kate Kollectible is on the market. A CD single of "Cloudbusting,"
produced by good ol' EMI America. There's only one li'l hitch --
it's promo-only. Which means that they are scarce and expensive.
Music Machine had a copy which they wouldn't part with; they'd only
gotten a couple in and the first one had immediately sold for $20.
I told them to pleeease hold one for me if they got another one in,
but they could make no guarantees about their availability.
Some artifaKT, eh?

&gt;And besides, IED kind of liked "The Breakfast Club"!

The ending wasn't TOO improbable, was it? It had a few good moments,
but not enough.

&gt;Those EMI-America executives have GOT to be the STUPIDEST
&gt;people in the record industry.

Yeah, otherwise they'd put the damn CDs on the market!

And now, reviews....

SUZANNE VEGA, "Solitude Standing" (A&amp;M)
Release Date: 27 April
Track Listing: Tom's Diner, Luka, Ironbound - Fancy Poultry, In The
Eye, Night Vision, Solitude Standing, Calypso, Language, Gypsy,
Wooden Horse, Tom's Diner (Reprise).
Suzanne Vega is inspired by the unlikeliest things. Poultry, for
instance. She sings wistfully, "Fancy poultry parts sold
here...breasts and thighs and hearts. Backs are cheap and wings
are nearly free...nearly free." Odd, yes, but the beauty and
sadness in her voice never fail to move, no matter what the lyric
is. In "Luka," she sings, in first-person, the tale of an abused
young boy, without making it maudlin; she also becomes a "Wooden
Horse" who springs to life. Fortunately, "Solitude Standing" is
not the "rawk-and-roll" album many feared; once again, the
arrangements are as simple, lovely and unadorned as her voice,
heavy on the acoustic guitar. "Solitude Standing" is just as
wonderful as the debut, and reaffirms Suzanne's rare talents.

WIRE, "The Ideal Copy" (Enigma)
Release Date: 28 April
Track Listing: The Point of Collapse, Ahead, Madman's Honey, Feed Me,
Ambitious, Cheeking Tongues, Still Shows, Over Theirs.
The return of Wire inspired delight and a bit of trepidation.
These "reunion" gigs are seldom true to the original spirit of the
band, but when this quartet (Newman, Gilbert, Lewis, Gotobed) got
together again, they played like they'd never been away. And here
is "The Ideal Copy" -- it's hard to believe that it's been eight
years since "154." "Ahead" is soaring, splendid; "Feed Me" slow and
fierce, built around one penetrating guitar riff, while the voice
is heavy with doom -- map ref., the darkest Roxy Music, circa
"Triptych." "Ambitious" is a marvelous machine, as detached vocals
spit out long lists of initials...I.R.A., K.G.B. From dancefloor glory
to the depths of the abyss -- Wire will take you everywhere.
Those who missed out on them the first time 'round should not make
the same mistake again.

--Sue

Personal lyric to Dave Juitt:
"Mr. Kite is soaring, Conky's *still snoring*"
