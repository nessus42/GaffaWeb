Well, it looks like "Night Flight" pulled out their old KT
video profile (from Nov 85?), since there were references to
the success of RUTH "this year". But since I had not seen it
before, I was glad I got it on tape (in fact I could not sleep
and watched both the 0230 and 0630 showings) and to see such things
as how young she looked in the "Wuthering Heights" video and how
awkward the dance routine looked compared to later performances.
The "Babooshka" video was, um, interesting. Actually, "Babooshka" is
one of my favorite OTTD (other than "The Dreaming)  songs (I expect
flames from Doug about this!). I thought it represented the story
quite well, although the sword is a little much. "Cloudbusting" is,
well, a masterpiece.

Speaking of "Babooshka", I have been listening to "Never For Ever"
a lot recently, especially after getting it on CD (although my having
it on the opposite side of the tape from TD may account for some of this).
It doesn't assault my senses like TD, but has much of its maturity. I guess
the comparison I would make would be if TD were "Sgt Pepper" and HoL were
"Abbey Road", then NFE would be "Rubber Soul". Anyways, for what my
opinion is worth...
I do have a question though. "Blow Away" seems to be talking about
a musician that died, and has the reference: (for Bill) in the title.
Any idea who this is?

I haven't had a chance to listen to the backwards tracks in "Watching
You Without Me", but I did stumble upon something interesting. When I
slowed down the "scattered" or "chopped" voices something comparable
to say, going from 45 to 33 rpm, the voices were much more understandable.
I tried this on X4, but haven't gotten much yet. Also, thanks to Scott ?

&gt;Really-From: prs@oliven.atc.olivetti.com (Philip Stephens)

Me:
&gt;&gt;Uh-oh, my pet peeves... How do you DEFINE "normal" or "proper"? Who
&gt;&gt;makes these "standards"? And why must music need a good reason to "pass
&gt;&gt;beyond the bounds of what is normal or proper"? I would have no problems
&gt;&gt;with your statement had it been something like "I like what's normal and
&gt;&gt;proper", but you claimed to like "weirdness". 

Phil:
&gt;My point is that *you* are defining your own normal and proper to reject my
&gt;taste, and defining outre in terms of violating what some people you hate
&gt;(you parents? teachers?) consider normal and proper.  Just another turn of 
&gt;the idiotic wheel.

Ummm... I never linked "normal and proper" with anyone's tastes. I have
nothing against people liking music that's different from mine, but don't 
point to a complex sound collage and say: THAT'S not music.

I believe that "normal and proper" are arbitrary standards imposed for a
variety of reasons, and especially when I discuss something like music,
I try not to be bound by preconceived ideas of what (normal and proper)
music *should* be like. THAT'S what I was trying to say: (almost) nothing
should be too outre/bizarre/unacceptable/violent (physically or emotionally) 
if it works (in some vague sense) within the piece of music/art/fiction.
(The "almost" gives me a convenient escape hatch for things like bigotry,
racism, etc.)

I also get on very well with my parents and my teachers.

Me:
&gt;&gt;Hof has shown open-mindedness and sophistication in his appreciation of
&gt;&gt;music. You have not. 

Phil:
&gt;Meaningless statement.  I complained a little, and now you think you know
&gt;enough about me to pass judgement.  

All I said was "You have not SHOWN etc." No judgements passed; please parse
sentence again. 

&gt;Considering what you have said (below)
&gt;about music you happen not to like, I don't think much of your perspective
&gt;on openness nor sophistication.  

I like/have liked a wide variety of music. A (megabyte?) list of music
I've spent time with in the past few years is available on request (tho
why anyone would be interested in my mental masturbation is beyond me). It 
would probably include large chunks of the traditional classical repertory,
20th century "serious" music, bebop, some free jazz, cheesy '60s 
psychedelia, cheesy '80s psychedelia, '70s dinosaurs, pretentious '60s
experimental music, pretentious '80s experimental female singers, punk,
post-punk, hardcore, home-tape-noodlers, electronic/industrial music, etc.

&gt;So you're asking me to be trendy and not like the Moody Blues because they
&gt;are out of fashion, or because you personally don't like them. 

No, go ahead and like whatever you want. Last time we had this '70s art
rock debate in love-hounds, I promised not to repeat my position on the
much-revered dinosaurs in this forum, so I won't. Send me email if
you're interested. And good luck with Hof's tape...

Bill
