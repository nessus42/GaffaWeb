Private to IED/am, but may get sent to moderator (I'm not sure how well
our rn is set up).  If this slips into distribution, my apologies for 
wasting bauds.

In article &lt;8704072328.AA03635@EDDIE.MIT.EDU&gt; you write:
&gt;
&gt;About the backwards track, which Mark K. mentions, Phil's
&gt;elaborately detailed transcription of it is still being
&gt;examined and compared against the original by IED. So far,
&gt;as far as IED can make out, it does seem to be
&gt;correct. That is, the "choppy", or "scatter-voice" sections
&gt;of "Watching You Without Me" seem to say something like
&gt;what Phil wrote down when played BACKWARDS. How Kate did

	(thanks)

&gt;this IED has no idea, but it is AMAZING. Unfortunately,
&gt;this gets us no closer towards a conclusion re the official
&gt;mystery section of the track.
&gt;
&gt;IED's Missouri friend argues that whatever the solution to
&gt;the mystery track, its solution almost certainly does not require
&gt;expensive or hard-to-obtain equipment. The last mystery
&gt;track was ridiculously simple, in the end.
&gt;
&gt;After further consideration and discussion, IED has to
&gt;reject Phil's (?) theory that there is something deliberately

	(? I forget, maybe someone else.  My backward cassette has
	The Dreaming too, so I'll give it a listen "soon".)

&gt;being said in the "Leave It Open" mystery track when played backwards.
&gt;It just isn't so. The sounds are a lot like:
&gt;"Nthey send they wuht vewy heee-uhw.." but they are not precise
&gt;English words. All you have to do is imitate the phonetics yourself,
&gt;record your voice, and play it backwards, and you'll hear
&gt;"We let the weirdness in." That's all it is. The new mystery track,
&gt;however, is definitely something much cleverer.
&gt;
&gt;About the tape circulation, why not if IED makes a 90-minute tape
&gt;with about ten minutes of stuff recorded on it (the remainder left
&gt;blank) -- stuff that he's relatively sure nobody else has heard before --
&gt;and send it off to, say, Mark Kat(e)souros? Mark can then add ten minutes
&gt;of his recommended stuff, and forward the tape to Sue or somebody.
&gt;And so on. The only restriction would be that no-one take up more
&gt;than say ten to twelve minutes of the tape.
&gt;All those in favour say "aye".
&gt;
	Aye me hearty, 'twud do me a good turn ya wud by that.

Mail welcome, but my mailer seldom cooperates when I try to reply.
