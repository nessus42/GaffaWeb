 I had been hearing that there was going to be a new Throwing Muses
 album coming out "soon" so I was pleased to see  _Chains Changed_
 in the bins today.  I was a bit disappointed to find out it's a
 45-RPM 4-song 12", not a full blown album.  First off, does anyone
 know if there is an album due out as well?  Or is this the rumored
 new release?
 
 Anyway, I snatched up a copy since the first album really grew on
 me.  I was surprised to find that _Chains Changed_ was much more
 accessable.  I mean, you won't here "snail head" on you local
 top 40 station, but all four songs immediately appealed to me.
 It's possible that I just had a better idea of what to expect,
 but the songs do seem less off-the-wall.  The vocals are still quite
 distinctive, but more controlled.  The feel of the songs ("finished",
 "reel", "snail head" and "cry baby cry") is more consistent and all
 run about the same tempo (medium-fast).  There are still some weirdo
 musical effects adding country-western jangles at points.  In fact,
 my idea of country music these days is Christmas and Throwing Muses...
 The lyrics are still marvelous too, but again they seem less bizarre
 when compared to the first album.
 
 Though, I could just be getting jaded... :-)
 
 This is a nice little compilation of songs which compliments
 their debut album; if you liked the first one, this should be
 a pleasant morsel to hold your appetite until a more complete
 offering is available.
