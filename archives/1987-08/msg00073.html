Really, Bill, Greg thanks for the kind words.  You didn't have to.  A truce
please with this person who is antagonizing me, please - I'd rather talk
about music than flame and argue (contrary to popular opinion)

Discarded TEchnology Query

Has anybody used this "Soundvision" program that runs on the Mac?  It's supposed
to work in tandem with an animation program but there';s no manual as it's
a bootleg copy and the animation is a demo so you can't keep your creations.
However, the Soundvision part is a four voice (A,B,C and D) thing that you
can literally trace your melodys.  Steal (cut/Copy) and edit them.  Flip
flop them around and transfer them later on in the score.  Edit the wavo-
form.  Use a sine wave or a box wave and all sortsa neato shit.  I programmed
in a descending chromatic piece and have been playing around with the
variable speed (which you can change while the program is running.  I guess
it's like the pre-cursor to what these third generation machines (as 
Newsweek is labeling them) will be able to do with video images.  The
possibilties seem unlimited at this time for the shit you'll be able to
do with these newer machines.   Anybody who can rent time and has a little
know how will be able to make cheap videos for their bands and pretty soon
the whole audio visual motion/sound thing will merge for the "everyday man"
types who are fooling around right now in the cassette "network" as touted
in Sound Choice and such.

I have to admit I suffer from a phobia about these brand name machines
and pretty much approach the cutting edge of music technology as it
presents itself to me rather than run around trying to keep up with
everything and blowing lots of money.  It's interesting how you can
take the residue of the discarded pieces of technology ( like say the
50 dollar used Casio MT-100 or something) and meld something new out of
them.

'nuff rambling.  Anyone got a suggestions for people who operate with
the mindset of above and have released music or play it in my local
area let me know.

PSYCODRAMA update - apparently the boys participated in this White
Segragationist march down in Colonial Heights (or Colonial "Whites") 
to protest the recent Southern black leadership marches down there.
They wanted me to come along but I said something about having to
fix my car.  (First questions was "how good of an actor are you?")

AntiSodomy Law Benefit Report
Just got back from a benefit for the fight against the anti-sodomy
laws for the ACLU and various Gay rights coalitions.  The bands
that played were BAD PIECES (Honeymoon Killers type stuff with tape
loops of feedback), IGNITION (Reptile Houseish (i.e. Druid Rock) 
type stuff with out an original guitarist I'm afriad), BROKEN SIREN
(hmmm... rough punk/female vocals over some widely varying rock music
from hardcore to country backbeat swing and such), RAIN (Rites Of Spring
revisted with some homage to the Who).  Sorry if you don't understand
the references but it seems like alot of the music lately is being
influenced by bands that don't have any national recognition and
it's hard to make comparisions unless you are familiar with some
lesser-known bands these days.  Is this what they call fragmentation?

I'll bring any pertinent addresses in later (for donations/information
and such)...

A word on this tape thing - I recently got a chain letter in which
you send a tape out to the guy on the bottom of the list.  Add your
name to the top and send it to however many people you think will
dig the idea.  I guess it's alot better than the scare chain letters.
Maybe the love-hounds tape thing could turn in to something like that
where you are adding other people to the list all the time?  Just
a suggestion.

					 you make/ me want you"
