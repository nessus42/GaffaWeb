&gt;But it is true! It is it is it is! My friend has been a fan since
&gt;the very first, and is a fervent collector of Katiana! He would not
&gt;err. Besides, he told me the title and even I didn't recognize it...
&gt;but I'm *so* embarrassed, I forgot it! I promise -- I'll call him
&gt;tonight and get it!

OK, IED believes you, Sue!! Halelujah, KhrisT be praised!
YET ANOTHER BONUS KATE TRACK!! How have we come to deserve
such heavenly bounty, oh Saviour?
(But if you turn out to be wrong about this, Sue...If IED doesn't
receive that new KT track by June 1, 1987....KhrisT WILL TAKE HIM
BACK UNTO HER, AND HE WILL BE NO MORE OF THIS WORLD!)

&gt;This should make up for my little lapse, though, IED -- a brand-new
&gt;Kate Kollectible is on the market. A CD single of "Cloudbusting,"
&gt;produced by good ol' EMI America. There's only one li'l hitch --
&gt;it's promo-only. Which means that they are scarce and expensive.
&gt;Music Machine had a copy which they wouldn't part with; they'd only
&gt;gotten a couple in and the first one had immediately sold for $20.
&gt;I told them to pleeease hold one for me if they got another one in,
&gt;but they could make no guarantees about their availability.
&gt;Some artifaKT, eh?

This is really an amazing co-incidence, Sue. Only LAST NIGHT IED got
a call from a Missouri Kate-fan (and good friend), telling IED of the
new limited edition promotional CD single of "Cloudbusting".
THIS GUY HAD JUST GOT ONE FROM MUSIC MACHINE YESTERDAY! He paid
$20.00, just as you said. He must have been the person that you said
they had sold one to! Anyway, IED called MM at the crack
of dawn this morning, only to be told that he was too late,
but that they would be trying to get more in. There are supposed
to be only 1,000 of them.
Anyway, since this morning IED has made the complete rounds of
every record store in the L.A. area asking about the damn thing,
but no-body here had seen or heard of one yet. Darn it!
If you find an extra one, could you PLEASE let IED know??
He will forever pledge his troth unto you, or whatever...

Thanks again to Neil for the description of the Ferry Aid video.
And to Norvald for his alertness re the news stories. Unfortunately,
the news reports on Los Angeles TV showed only the pre-video video-tape
of Boy George and a few of the flash-in-the-pan UK "stars" showing
up at the studio.

About the cannon-shot analogy, Dave, IED agrees with you that in
general Kate's impaKT can be just as strong as a volley of same.
Her "Let It Be" contribution, however, is exceptional in that
it is very unobtrusive and understated. In the context of her vocal,
the whole rest of the track is out of place.
It doesn't surprise IED at all that Kate was not visible
in the final chorus section -- probably because she came in
to do her part at the very end, perhaps after the chorus had
been taped; but possibly because she might indeed have fled in horror.

About the backwards track, which Mark K. mentions, Phil's
elaborately detailed transcription of it is still being
examined and compared against the original by IED. So far,
as far as IED can make out, it does seem to be
correct. That is, the "choppy", or "scatter-voice" sections
of "Watching You Without Me" seem to say something like
what Phil wrote down when played BACKWARDS. How Kate did
this IED has no idea, but it is AMAZING. Unfortunately,
this gets us no closer towards a conclusion re the official
mystery section of the track.

IED's Missouri friend argues that whatever the solution to
the mystery track, its solution almost certainly does not require
expensive or hard-to-obtain equipment. The last mystery
track was ridiculously simple, in the end.

After further consideration and discussion, IED has to
reject Phil's (?) theory that there is something deliberately
being said in the "Leave It Open" mystery track when played backwards.
It just isn't so. The sounds are a lot like:
"Nthey send they wuht vewy heee-uhw.." but they are not precise
English words. All you have to do is imitate the phonetics yourself,
record your voice, and play it backwards, and you'll hear
"We let the weirdness in." That's all it is. The new mystery track,
however, is definitely something much cleverer.

About the tape circulation, why not if IED makes a 90-minute tape
with about ten minutes of stuff recorded on it (the remainder left
blank) -- stuff that he's relatively sure nobody else has heard before --
and send it off to, say, Mark Kat(e)souros? Mark can then add ten minutes
of his recommended stuff, and forward the tape to Sue or somebody.
And so on. The only restriction would be that no-one take up more
than say ten to twelve minutes of the tape.
All those in favour say "aye".
