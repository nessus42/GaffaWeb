Re: Just a few questions

Hi, Andrew. Always great to see such interest in the one true and only...
I rarely write for info about KT, but am an avid fan and read LH all
the time.  Often many of my questions are answered by many of you without
you even realizing what you are doing.  But I must respond and ask a few
questions that it seems I haven't seen the answer to and am very anxious to
find out about.  I would appreciate any information.

&gt;1)  I know that a boxed set of KT 45's exists, and that it is only available
&gt;through the KB fan club...my question is:  How do I join the fan club?
&gt;And how do I get a boxed set?  I know of 2 other people who would 'dye' to
&gt;have a set.

There is a boxed set. It was never put out by the Kate Bush Club.
It was, however, a "limited edition" set put out officially by EMI.
There were actually two "limited editions". The first was a numbered
run of IED-forgets-how-many thousand. These are now, in theory, more
valuable and harder to come by than the second, unnumbered edition,
which was larger and which is distinguished (or was originally) by
being wrapped in shrink-wrap. The boxed set had thirteen singles,
which were actually reproductions of the originals (except for the
two singles which had been released most nearly contemporaneously, of
which there were still extras). The difference was mainly that
the originals were made of the stiffer card-paper, whereas the
boxed sets' versions were sleeved in flimsy paper. The cover designs
were the same. There were also tiny catalogue-detail differences
between the original releases and the boxed set singles, and
the couple of singles that had different LP mixes were represented
in the boxed set by the LP mixes, for some reason. There was a
small colour photo booklet that accompanied the singles. A new
unnumbered boxed set oughtn't to cost more than about $35.00, but
IED just saw a USED unnumbered set on prominent display at the L.A.
Bleecker Bob's for $100.00, a rip-off that is almost certainly not
unusual nowadays. Copies probably still available from Intergalactic,
at somewhat more reasonable cost, maybe.

&gt;2)  I just found a copy of the Dec 86 Homeground fanzine and was wondering
&gt;if I can get a subscription here in the US?  I was planning to do so, but I
&gt;am also interested in the other fanzines that are available to KT fans.
&gt;Please let me know what others exist and how to join.

Homeground is available by subscription from the one and only
UK offices. The address is:

Homeground
c/o Peter Fitzgerald-Morris, Krystina Fitzgerald and Dave Cross
P.O. Box 176
Orpington, Kent
BR5 3NA
England

An airmail subscription is something around 8 or 9 Pounds now,
IED believes. It comes out at a rate of about four a year.

&gt;3)  Does anyone know of the address of Intergalactic Garage
&gt;that so many of you
&gt;talk about?  I would be very excited to find out what they have available.

Intergalactic Garage
c/o Allan Balliet
P.O. Box 7323
Washington, D.C. 20044
(703) 241-0473

&gt;4)  I was recently in a Reckless Records store and I was told that a KT
&gt;picture disk record exists.  What is the EMI catalog # or what is the
&gt;song on the disk,  or is this a rumor?

There are two official KT picture disks now. The first came out in
1979 (!). It was a picture disk of the first LP, The Kick Inside.
This is now very very rare and for a while could be seen priced
at upwards of $100.00. Then a second, larger edition came out of
the same picture disk, and the price went down to as low as
$9.00. Now both editions are rarish again, and sell for somewhere
around $20.00 to $30.00. The second KT picture disk is a seven-inch
of "The Big Sky". It was a limited run, and could be quite expensive
now, but shouldn't be.

Then there are the two recent twelve-inch picture-disk interview
LPs of Kate, both unofficial, both awful content-wise, but
picture-wise just as well made as the EMI official ones. They
are around in import stores throughout the country.

&gt;Thanks for your time.  I really appreciate it.  Please mail me direct if
&gt;you don't post to LHs.
&gt;-Andrew Elliott

Don't mention it. You're very welcome.
