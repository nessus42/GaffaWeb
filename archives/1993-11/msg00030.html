&gt; In article &lt;930225190603_555063.0_CHL54-1@CompuServe.COM&gt; MJM@ZYLAB.MHS.Compu
&gt; &gt;I was recently showing someone the Houdini description that Kate
&gt; &gt;once wrote (the story anout Ford, etc.) and the album cover and the
&gt; &gt;song.  Just when I thought I was thru, she asked about the lyrics,
&gt; &gt;and who Rosabelle is, and I was stumped.  I felt dumb because I know
&gt; 
&gt;    The phrase 'Rosabelle, believe' was the code phrase that 
&gt; Houdini worked out with his wife to send to her from the 
&gt; afterlife. Though Houdini's wife tried a myriad of mediums, 
&gt; none had the correct message. Well, apparently one did, but I do
&gt; believe it was shown that that medium and Mrs. Houdini had either
&gt; planned it out before, or she had accidentally informed him 
&gt; of the code phrase. 
&gt;    Rosabelle, of course, was just his wife's nickname, if I 
&gt; remember correctly.

"Rosabelle, sweet Rosabelle, I love you more than I could tell."
It's a line from the Houdini's favorite song, atleast that's what I've 
read. Supposedly that they agreed to use the name "Rosabelle" as the code 
word to contact each other. I also read that Beatrice Houdini had taken a 
fall down a flight of stairs and blacked out BUT she had mumbled 
"something" while she was "unconcious" that her nurse heard. As the story 
goes it was the nurse who told the psychic the code because that's what 
the "something" was that Beatrice mumbled.
