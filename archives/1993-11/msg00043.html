&gt;&gt; I have the opportunity to buy a signed copy of _HoL_ (vinyl).
&gt;&gt; Does anyone have an idea of the value of such an item?  I'd say
&gt;&gt; the record itself is VG/VG, certainly not mint, and is signed in blue
&gt;&gt; ink on the front cover.  Is US$40 too much, or a reasonable deal?

&gt;We paid $45 for what looks to me like a mint copy of _The Dreaming_ a
&gt;couple of years back.  That has been considered a steal by everyone I've
&gt;talked to.  I'm not sure what this might be worth as a "collector's item"
&gt;but it's worth a lot more than that to us.  I only which we had one signed
&gt;*to* us and preferably in person.  

I have a signed-to-me copy of a Japanese _Hounds of Love_ LP and it's a
prized possesion. I just can't *imagine* someone selling a signed album.
The only good part is if it goes to a good home, like yours.
(And yours, DavidK...should you decide...)

&gt;Speaking of having things signed in person, does anyone know just how many
&gt;people attended Kate's appearance at Tower Records in New York back in
&gt;1985?   I ask because Tori Amos attracted around 500 people to Rose Records
&gt;in Chicago and I can't imagine what kind of mob must have shown up for
&gt;Kate.  As it was, it took Tori over five hours to get to everyone.

We were there but I have no idea how many people showed up. Maybe |&gt;oug
knows. The line was *long*, I know that. It stretched all the way down
to the next block. We didn't stay in the line though. We already had
met Kate and gotten her autograph so we decided to go in the store and
just watch people, which was fun.

I *really* felt sorry for most of the people in line though. Kate didn't
get to a fraction of them before she had to leave to go to a live
interview (for new York's "Live At Five") and I imagine that there was
quite a bit of grumbling, if not outright anger. It wasn't Kate's fault,
it was the ***S-T-U-P-I-D*** people at EMI America who screwed up. They
obviously had no faith that anyone would show up. I believe that Kate
herself was quite upset at it and it wouldn't suprise me if that in-store
was on the list of reasons why she left the label.

I'm not suprised that Tori stayed, she's such a sweetheart. It's so nice
that the folks at Rose Records didn't mind staying too.

It was nice to meet you Richard!

Vickie
