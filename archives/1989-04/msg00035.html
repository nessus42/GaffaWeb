 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: Demos distrib logistics

     IED has received still more requests and suggestions regarding
the copying and transcription of _The_Cathy_Demos_Volume_One_.
The VHS-HiFi idea would be great--if IED had access to such a machine
for the purposes of making a high-quality "master". But he doesn't.
He should add also, for the sake of the audiophilic philo-canines
in our midst, that at this point IED's lone copy of the demos has
been played on his none-too-great turntable (with its now-quite-old
and never-was-too-hot-to-begin-with cartridge and tone-arm) about
four hundred times. And anyway, the vinyl on which the music was
pressed was highly bio-degradable in the first place. For this
reason such considerations as HiFi vs. ordinary high-bias audio-tape
seem a little pointless. Better to settle for the possible and timely
than the improbable and time-delaying, IED thinks--at least at this
premature stage in the demos-bootlegging game. After all, no self-
respecting bootlegger who, having possession of twenty or so totally
exclusive Kate Bush demos, failed to re-release the collection on
CD at some point, would be a poor bootlegger indeed in this day and
age. So perhaps when such a product graces the horizon of illicit
musical programming, to-dos about the merits of helical scanning,
pulse-code modulation, etc., will be in order. Until then, IED
suggests: Everyone wanting to receive a plain old ordinary home-made
dub of the _Cathy_Demos_, and who is ready and willing to send along
a blank tape and a stamped SAE, should send in a one-line acknowledge-
ment to that effect, either to Love-Hounds or to IED, by midnight PST
April 16. That will let the group know how many copies are going to
be needed. Sound OK?
     Also, the cassette should be of 90 minutes' length. This will
allow room for IED's program of additional KT material. That material
will probably not consist of any music which longtime Kate collectors
don't already have: more along the lines of the complete b-sides, plus
a few much-loved but no longer particularly obsKure Tracks.
