&gt; *Excerpts from ext.in.love-hounds: 10-Apr-89 Re: _Cathy_Demos_ distribut..*
&gt; *Love-Hounds-request@GAFF (1333)*
&gt; I have high-end equipment, and would gladly help out, but my
&gt; time is scarce.  Specifically, I have a Nakamichi LX-3 and also
&gt; a JVC HRD-470 HiFi VCR.  For me to record tapes, I would have
&gt; to copy the original tape onto a HiFi VCR tape (which has more
&gt; than 90 dB s/n and is practically transparent, recording-wise)
&gt; as a master tape, and then make cassette copies from that.


If IED has a HiFi VCR, it would be best for him to make the master tape using
the VCR, then farm it out to a person who will dub cassette copies.  This will
result in the highest quality copies for everybody, since the fidelity of a HiFi
VCR is just a tad bit less than CD quality and far, far better than cassette
tape.

Really, I would like to hear the Cathy Demos as much as anyone else, but I'm not
big on listening to muddled audio and tape hiss from an nth-generation copy of
the tape.  I am also not big on listening to tapes made by individuals who do
not care about proper audio level adjustment, noise reduction, and equalization
settings.  I am not making comments about anyone in particular, since I know
none of you personally, but I would like some assurance that the person doing
the copying knows what he/she is doing.

Someone needs to find out how many tapes are needed.  Perhaps someone should
volunteer to take orders, so that the person who will eventually do the
duplication will know how much work he/she should expect.

I have a Panasonic PV-4860 HiFi VCR and access to a NAD cassette deck.  I will
also offer to make copies, though I would prefer to do so from a
first-generation master.
