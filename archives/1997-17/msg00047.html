<PRE>
&gt;  For example "Kashka from
&gt; Bagdhad".  We learn in this version that the person singing is debating
&gt; acting on their own gay feelings "what would I do if I was seen/what
&gt; would I do if they knew my true feelings?".  There's also a funny line
&gt; that must have later been revised: "except for the man who takes the
&gt; garbage out..."

Thanks for this angle.  I have very few of the demos, and had not 
heard this particular version.  Having read this, I looked up the demo 
lyrics on the web, as well as the recorded ones.

Now for a question.  In the liner notes to "Lionheart", and in the 
"Kate Bush Complete" songbook, the background singing is not written 
out.  

Several folks on the web have written them as "Watching every night, 
Don't they know they're seen?  Won't you let me laugh?  Let me in your 
love." 

And an alternative is suggested, the nonsensical "Utcha every night".

Now, in my twelve years as a KT listener, I have always thought that 
she was singing either: (implied I as the subject)"Watch ya' every 
night, don'tcha notice me?"  Or possibly "don'tcha notice it?"  In 
this context, she appears to be singing longingly to Kashka and 
companion outside of their hearing, and goes very well with the "what 
if they knew my true feelings" from the earlier embryonic version. 

Frankly, while "don't they know they're seen?" fits the song, I don't 
get why she would be presumably speaking ABOUT them, and then suddenly 
switch to the "won'tcha let me laugh?  Let me in your love," which 
seems obvious to me is a silent plea to Kashka.

I've been listening to the song closely, but I just can't make it out.  
(It does sound like she's singing "Utcha", too!)  Has anyone else 
heard what I've been hearing for over a decade, and am I in the 
ballpark with this one?

Also, is there more to the reference to alley cats "coming out" (!!!) 
than is apparent at first glance?  

And a non-Kashka observation: On side 1 of HOL, we hear "It's you and 
me" as a theme.  "It's you and me, Daddy" (and also on the b-side 
"Burning Bridge" "It's you and me baby, against the world!").

I just realized today the contrast with the OTHER side, "Under Ice": 
"It's ME!"

Hmmm.
