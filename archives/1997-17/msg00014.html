&gt;&gt; Hi! 
&gt;&gt; I'm just a newbie. I only discovered Kate's music last year... so could
&gt;&gt; somebody answer to my questions?
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if "Waking the witch" has to be seen in parallel with
&gt;&gt; "The witches of Salem" by Arthur Miller. Moreover, one of my friend told
&gt;&gt; me that a part of "Nosferatu" soudtrack has been used in "The Ninth
&gt;&gt; Wave": is it right?
&gt;&gt; Finally does "Under Ice" refer to something particular?
&gt;&gt; Thaks for your help and answers!

&gt;The Ninth Wave (a conceptual pieces) is composed of all the songs on the
&gt;second side of HOL.  The piece was inspired by a true event where a woman
&gt;fell into icy water and was there overnight until her rescue.

    "True event"? Nope...Kate's never said as such. Henry Burdett Messenger
did theorize that The Ninth Wave was inspired by the Fastnet yatching disaster,
but it's never been confirmed. Kate has never spoken of the events in The
Ninth Wave other than metaphorically.

[theory deleted]

&gt;Even as I've been writing this I've been listening to an interview of Kate
&gt;who summed up Ninth Wave as about a woman in the water overnight.  During
&gt;the night her past present and future come to her to keep her awake until
&gt;she is rescued.

    Henry's piece (available on Gaffaweb <A  HREF="http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/">http://www.gryphon.com/gaffa/</A>) 
has been reinforced in my mind by a famous image from the Fastnet
rescue. A sailor, after being in the freezing water most of the night is
being lifted to rescue helicopter. He's uncounsious and his head is
to one side...in the same position as Kate on the back cover. This
image was as closely associated with Fastnet as the image of the
firefighter and little girl one from the Oklahoma City bombing.

&gt;The Tennyson quote, per Kate, has nothing to do with the piece.  She needed
&gt;a title for the piece and the quote fit.

   True, especially as the quote was attributed wrongly on the original
release. Having it wrong did annoy Kate quite a bit, but it obviously
wasn't so vital to the piece that it was correct in the begining.
