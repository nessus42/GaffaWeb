&gt;Having joined the list somewhat late in life, and reading with great 
&gt;interest the account of IED's Katemas party, I was wondering how many of 
&gt;you here have actually MET IED, in person, and what the experience was 
&gt;like.  Anybody with a 4'x4' poster of KT is certainly worth his own poll.

Well, Chris and I have never actually met IED, but we
have met Andrew Marvick quite a few times. I guess
IED was always too haughty to come out and say hi. :-)

Andrew though, is one of the nicest people you could
ever hope to meet. He's a Kate Bush fan extrodinaire,
and a wonderful human being. 

I do believe Chris and I have the honor to have been 
the first Love-Hounds to meet this lovely fella in person. 
It was the end of 1983 and we already knew of Andrew from 
the old Kate fanzine "BreakThrough". Chris and I took a
trip out to San Diego and while we were in SoCal we took
a brief trip up to Los Angeles to meet Armando Gallo, and
to attend a wonderful Kate fan party. That's when we met the 
man in the flesh. If we hadn't been endeared enough by him,
he clinched it when he pulled out a video of "There Goes
A Tenner" which none of us had seen. 

Ah, memories of the days when fandom thrills came in bits 
and pieces, a single here, a video there, another *ALBUM!*, 
another fan who feels the same way you do met, a snippet 
of a press mention. All things that made/make the world seem 
even more beautiful at the moment.

We've met Andrew many times more since that first meeting.
most recently at last year's Katemas. We've been in and out
of touch through the years, but he's the one who urged us
to get on the net and he was our go-between before we 
actually did. In over 13 years of friendship, he has never 
been anything but a kind, gracious, and patient friend, who
has always forgiven us even when we've been our most flaky.
He's a sweetheart, he is, and I love him dearly.

&gt;P.S.  I did finally turn up the name of the guy who remastered HoL - it's 
&gt;in the credits but the name escapes me.  The guy's very good.
