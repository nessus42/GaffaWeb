&gt;&gt;&gt;  Is everyone aware of the primary reasons that Kate doesn't tour     
&gt;&gt;&gt;     anymore? I too have always been saddened by the fact that I can't
&gt;&gt;&gt;     see her perform, but after she lost a crew member to a stage     
&gt;&gt;&gt;     rigging accident she called off any future touring.
&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;      I may be wrong, but I think Bill died during rehersals thus BEFORE
&gt;&gt; the TOur Of Life actually started.

   True.

&gt;I have always heard that the primary reason we don't see her here in the
&gt;states is because she doesn't like to fly.  Kind of difficult to get here
&gt;from England if you don't fly.

    She doesn't *like* it, but she *does* it. She has flown here several
times. We met her plane once, and she flew the Concorde apparently
to spend as little time aboard a plane as possible. She comes here
to do the little promotion she does. Logically, if she'll fly here to promote
and sign at Tower, she could do a tour, most of which are done via
trucks and buses.

&gt;But, hey, I like other groups that don't tour, i.e. Steely Dan (at least
&gt;not until recently).  BTW, I'm happy to say that I attended the Aja tour. 
&gt;The album came out in 1977(?), the tour occured in 1993.  Now there's a
&gt;long wait for a tour. :-)

    Yeah, their tour does give us hope. BTW, Kate lists that album as one
of her favorites...the song "Peg" especially.
