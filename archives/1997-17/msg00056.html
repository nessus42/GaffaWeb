&gt;&gt;On a different Kate topic, I recently watched again my video
&gt;&gt;recording of The Young Ones' "Les Dogs", featuring Kate (sigh).
&gt;&gt;What do love-hounds think of this bizarre tale?
&gt;&gt;(May be more familiar to the UK contingent)

&gt;As an American fan of both Kate and The Young Ones, and a victim of the
&gt;difficulty of gathering information on both during the pre-internet
&gt;days, this post made me curious.  I thought that I had seen all of the
&gt;episodes of TYO multiple times on MTV several years ago, but I don't
&gt;remember any Kate references, or an episode called "Les Dogs".  I've
&gt;read about the Kate/Young Ones skit from Comic Relief (but sadly, I have
&gt;never seen it).  Is this what you are referring to, or is "Les Dogs"
&gt;something else entirely?  Details please.

OK, I should start by apologising because I said The Young Ones.
The minute I read your post I realised that it wasn't the Young Ones
actually, but the spin-off series of shows with the generic title
"The Comic Strip Presents...", featuring some members of the
Young Ones team.

Comic Strip shows included "Bad News", "More Bad News"
(about a very crappy heavy metal band), skits on Enid Blyton's
Famous Five stories, and "Ken" for which of course Kate
contributed a song.

The story called "Les Dogs" was centred around a wedding reception
where Kate played the bride and had got married to an appalling slob
of a creature whom she inexplicably appeared to adore. The wedding
reception degenerated into a gun battle between the two families. Peter
Richardson played a mysterious character who somehow walked into
the middle of all this and fell for the bride immediately.

There seemed to be all kinds of weird subtexts to the thing, such as
Britain being ruled by a dictator who had just banned all cars, and so on.
And Les Dogs? They were a very peculiar sort of glam-punk band who
were hired to play at the wedding, and ended up being slaughtered in
the crossfire.

Does this help?

Best wishes,
Ian.
