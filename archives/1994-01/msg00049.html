2 short articles from NOW, "Toronto's weekly news and entertainment
newspaper".
*************
NOW magazine, December 16, 1993
 
Bush on film
 
Evidently, British pop siren Kate Bush has a soft spot for Canada. Though 
she hates to fly, she made Toronto the only North American stop besides 
New York on a promo tour for her newest record, _The Red Shoes_, and 
the premiere of her directorial debut film, The Line, The Cross and The Curve.
 
The 50-minute short loosely links six songs from the album with the Red Shoes
fairy tale of a dancer whose ballet slippers refuse to stop dancing.  The film 
is a far cry from Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's 1948 classic.
In essence, it's a long form video, and Bush is the first person to agree 
this isn't the film she really wanted to make.  But since EMI is willing
to pay for it, why not answer when opporunity knocks?
 
"In a way, it was very restrictive because it's not my conceptual piece 
from scratch.  Also, I'm working around the songs and I had to put myself 
into the film.  I would've preferred to cast myself in a smaller role.
 
"It wasn't the ideal situation because it was very rushed and we had
little money.  But it was an intense project.  And I'm very glad I went
through it, even if the film is not received well, because I learned so much."

Celebrity spins - Who's playing What right now
 
Kate Bush 
British pop siren and modern dance enthusiast who recently released a 
new album, _The Red Shoes_ (EMI), and overcame an intense dislike
of flying to arrive in town last week for chats with the media and a
preview screening of her 50-minute directorial debut film, _The Line, 
The Cross and The Curve_, likely to be released on video in Feburary or March.
 
TALK TALK : _Laughing Stock_
"I don't listen to a lot of things when I'm working but I'm really into them,
especially the last two albums.  I think they're great - really really 
interesting."
 
PRINCE: _The Hits/The B-sides_
"I worked with him on _The Red Shoes_. I listen to a lot of his work. I'm 
into dancing and I put it on in our dance classes.  It's great to dance to."
 
STEVIE WONDER
"I still listen to a lot of my favourite old records like Stevie's,
David Bowie and Captain Beefheart.  I had a binge earlier this year
where I was just listening to all my old records and it was great.
I hadn't listen to them in a long time."
