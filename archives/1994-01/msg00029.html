Hi, gang.  Well, now that I'm officially on Gaffa, I'd like to introduce
myself.  My name is Rob and I'm a law student at Temple University School
of Law.  I've just recently gotten into Kate's music over the past year,
and she is now among my favorite performers.  Since I'm so new to her
music, I have A LOT of questions (eg. What/where is Gaffa? Who are the
persons named at the end of MoPleasure?  Why do side A and side B of
Hounds of Love each have a different title? etc. etc. etc.) and rather
than clutter the list with questions that have probably been asked 100 times,
I wonder if there is a FAQ I could get and how I could go about doing
that.

I find a lot of spiritual themes in Kate's music.  There are likely many
more than just those I've found--they've probably just gone over my head.
Also, it seems there are a lot of spiritual people on the list.  Has
Kate herself ever mentioned the influence of spirituality on her music?
DISCLAIMER:  I'm not trying to propagate this Lily thread which has apparently
dragged on for a month--although I'm sorry I missed it.  Any kind soles out
there willing to e-mail me (personally) a summary of the contended meanings of
the song?

I have lots of comments, but I'll save them for future posts.  I'd just like
to leave you with this thought.  So many bands and performers of the art rock
genre seem to have *passed* their pinnacle.  Bands like Kansas, Genesis,
King Crimson, Yes, etc. are among my favorites and and continue to create
great music, but it seems their heydays lie in the past and that they are now
at the denouement of their careers.  But Kate, IMHO, is now at the pinnacle
of her career.  I find her earliest albums to be her weakest.  Dreaming
was overkill--an attempt to change her style, but a bit overdone.  But then
she hit the mark at the bullseye with HoLove.  It's an incredibly powerful
album.  TSW was only an improvement on perfection, and TRShoes is, IMHO,
her best work.  I know many of you disagree with me, but I can't stop
listening to this CD, and I find sooooo much more with every listen.  It's
a fantastically layered album.
