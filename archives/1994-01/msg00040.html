KATE BUSH: WILL SHE OR WON'T SHE?  by Nick Krewen
One question has followed Kate Bush during the 15 years since she released her
first album and captured hearts everywhere with her elegant voice.  Is she ever
going to tour in North America?  Until now, the British singer's response has
always been No.  In a Toronto interview with Canadian journaltists, the normall
y media shy Bush said she may change her ways to promote her new album, The Red
Shoes.  "I'd like to do some dates at some point for this record," said Bush,
35, during a rare promotional visit. "But as of right now, I have no plans."
Bush has never played outside Europe. She finished her last tour - which
consisted of 30 full production shows which mixed mime, dance and music - in
1979.  Aside from the occasional charity benefit, Bush has shunned the stage
in favour of the studio.
"My reluctance to tour wasn't deliberate in a lot of ways," she explained.
"There was a presumption that I didn't enjoy it, which wasn't true. I did
enjoy it. It was an exciting time for me.  But it was completely exhausting,
and at the end of it I felt quite exposed.  At the time, I was concerned
that I was removing myself from writing songs and recording them, which
is what I wanted to do at the time.  I wanted to work more in the studio and
learn about production."
Bush says that by the time she got past a long phase where she lost all
desire to perform, she grew nervous about returning to the stage.
"Now I've come back to the idea of doing it - especially over the last couple
of years. If we did do something, I'd like to do something personal. The idea
of standing here and just singing my songs more simply now appeals to me."
If she decides to tour, she won't likely have to worry about filling seats.
Every Kate Bush album released in Canada has gone past platinum (100,000 copies
sold), and after just a month, The Red Shoes is already gold (50,000).
The album, her seventh, is loosely based on the Hans Christian Andersen
fairytale about a young girl who receives a pair of red shoes which allows her
to fulfil her dream of becoming a great dancer. She can't stop dancing, though
and the shoes won't allow themselves to be removed.  Eventually, the girl
orders her own feet to be amputated, and dies.
Mutilation aside, Bush says she identifies with the character. "The imagery of
possessed by an artform - which in this case is dance -  so it has a life of
its own, is something I can relate to.", she says. "I look at my albums as
probably the same kind of thing. I am very obsessed by my work when I'm in the
middle of it. I'm quite tenacious, and don't like to let go of it until I'm
sure I've finished it."
The Red Shoes also shoes a lighter side to Bush in such songs as Rubberband
Girl and Eat The Music.  She admits it was a conscious move to contrast
her last project, The Sensual World. "With every album, I like starting from
a fresh point," she says, "It's almost a rebellion. I need to do something
totally opposite."  "I wanted to put more emphasis on the songs this time out,
and less emphasis on production. I tried to make the songs more direct, simple,
and honest."
Bush sees the recording experience as a chance to work with friends and people
she admires. Some of the special guests on the album include violinist Nigel
Kennedy, Procol Harum founder Gary Brooker, and guitarists Jeff Beck and Eric
Clapton.  But the tops for her was collaborating with Prince on Why Should I
Love You?  "I'm so glad he agreed to work with me," says Bush. "I've been a
big fan of his for a long time."  Bush has also ventured into film, directing
a 50 min. short called The Lion, The Cross and The Curve, which co-stars
Miranda Richardson and is based around six of the album's songs. It should be
out on video some time next year.
Right now, it's time for a break. "I'm feeling very tired," admits Bush. "I'm
going on a holiday. I'm really looking forward to not pleasing anyone but
myself."

'Nuff said,
Les
