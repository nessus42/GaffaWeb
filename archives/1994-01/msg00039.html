Hello, again!

Well, I had a wonderful visit back East, hangin' with all the homies
in Beantown.  Catching up on two week's worth of Lovehounds, there's only
one point that needs to be addressed:

The "Rock 'n' Roll Comic" issue with Kate.  I think it's a wonderful,
must-have item for any serious Kate KollectTor.  It's the "Plan 9 of
Outer Space" of Kate Paraphanalia.  It's so horribly done, with such cheezy
artwork and brain-dead dialog that it's FANTASTIC!  The overused phrase
"so bad it's good" does not do this justice; It's so mind-numbingly HORRIBLE
that it's one of the BEST COMICS of ALL TIME!

Anyway, here's some Katestuff I ran into without even meaning to (for the
most part):

In a store I was in in Copley Place they were playing WFNX (Motto:  "All
Depeche Mode, All the Time"), when the DJ, coming out of a Depeche Mode
song, said, "Coming up next:  The latest from Kate Bush!"  (She probably
also said, "And several more songs by Depeche Mode", but I was too stunned
to remember exactly).  Yeah, I hardly notice when KITS plays Kate anymore,
and I knew WFNX had Kate in semi-heavy rotation, but "The Latest"?  My mind
raced:  Would it be the new American single, "Rubberband Girl"?  Would it
be the new British single "Moments of Pleasure"?  After listing to 15 minutes
of ads and inane DJ patter, finally it came on:  "Top of the City".  Huh?
I mean, I LIKE the song, but I would hardly consider it a great cut for
radioplay.  (The answer waited for me when I got home, going through the
aforementioned two weeks' of Lovehounds - which I would STILL be catching
up on if I bothered to read those messages by those two folks who's name
your sick of seeing, or anything by Chris who's desperately trying to
get the title 'Most Boring Person on Gaffa').  Anyway, the answer:  The
Program Director for FNX is just weird.

I went into HMV records, and was delighted to see the CD single of "Moments
of Pleasure" cost the same with or without the extra postcards.  But since
I'm one of those weirdos who likes Kate for the MUSIC, and since I have
everything on it, I didn't buy it.

Later on, I went to the coolest record store in the Universe, Main Street
Records in Northampton, Mass, and couldn't help chuckling when I saw they
had a small stack of The Red Shoebox.  The funniest part:  It seems whoever
cobbled these things together "Forgot" to include the ballet shoes.  Sheesh.
I didn't buy that, either.

I finally got to see the U.S. video for Rubberband Girl - a highly
forgettable piece.  However, I've always really wanted to see 'The
Line, The Cross, The Curve, and Her Lover' (or whatever it's called),
but now I REALLY, REALLY *HAVE* to see it!

Finally, I noticed in several papers that they included The Red Shoes in
the "Best Album of 1993" list.  While most of the reviews of TRS I've
disagreed with were too negative, one list (I forgot which paper) said,
"While TRS is not Kate Bush's best album - That title would go to 'The
Sensual World'..."  I nearly lost it when I read that.  I mean, I LIKE
both TRS and TSW - I like them A LOT - but Kate's BEST?  Hardly...

Oh, one final thought:  I can accept Kate being out-sold by Pearl Jam
and Weird Al.  I can even grudgingly accept her being out-sold by
Meatloaf and Beavis &amp; Butt-head.  But being out-sold by Barney the
Dinosaur?  Now, THAT'S an INSULT!
