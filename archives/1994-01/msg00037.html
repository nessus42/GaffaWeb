Happy New Year all!  Hope you're all still not doing all the things you
resolved not to do and doing all the things you resolved to do!  Cigarettes
and chocolate anyone?  :-)

Chris writes to OtherAndy

&gt;&gt;Oh no!!!  He asked what "Gaffa" means!!!  

Don't they all?  :-)

&gt;&gt;As a newcomer, the first thing you need to know is that you _never_ ask what
&gt;&gt;Gaffa means--it always starts a flamewar.  It's like saying "Niagra Falls" in
&gt;&gt;a Three Stooges film ["Niagra Falls!  Slooowwwllllyyy I turn, step by step,
&gt;&gt;inch by inch, . . ..].  Watch and see.  ;-)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    Oh, c'mon. We haven't had a "gaffa" flamewar *all year*!

Oh, sure!  All five days of it!  Now stop that!  If I keep giggling in my
office like this they'll send me away for sure!  :-)

&gt;- Her Greatness is planning to tour (this from someone involved in a
&gt;tour-related industry) but no dates as of yet.

Never mind when!  Where!!!  I have travel plans to make (possibly -
Vancouver has never been a major concert destination).

&gt;- "Wuthering Heights" by the "Kate Project" is indeed being played in the
&gt;clubs in Vancouver. It was on the top ten chart of the Odyssey but I asked
&gt;in a few Vancouver stores and couldn't find it. Maybe I was at the wrong
&gt;stores, but....I hope someone finds it soon.

I haven't heard it yet, but I will start looking for it.

Oh, I owe everyone a TRS review, don't I?  I'll be looking for that too and
will  type it up when I find it. :-) (grin of guilt)

I really hope everyone had a good holiday, whatever they celebrate - and
happy Christmas Eve to those of you who celebrate Ukranian Christmas (Jan
6)

Andrea.

Strange party, this.  There's hundreds of people here but I can't see
anyone, nobody's talking and I keep getting handed these little notes.
