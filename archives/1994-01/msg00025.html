&gt;Subject: UK CD
&gt;
&gt;section, which contained a copy of the UK CD single for "Moments of Pleasure".
&gt;It was horrendously overpriced, but I bought it anyway.  So what if I already
&gt;have all the songs that are on it multiple times- at least now I know what
&gt;people are talking about with the dancing on flaming skulls bit.  I find it
&gt;quite disconcerting that she's got such a gleeful grin on her face whilst
&gt;doing that- am I alone in this?

&gt;Subject: Re: UK CD
&gt;Meredith, you are not alone.  I mentioned this in a post several weeks ago
&gt;because it was terribly poignant, my wife and I just having scattered the
&gt;ashes of our baby boy who died on 13th Nov.  I am not sure what this image
&gt;has to do with the sentiment of the song.  It is rather contrary to what
&gt;I feel when I hear the song.  Is Kate just being bizarre?  

The cover picture of Kate dancing on the flaming skulls on the
Moments of Pleasure single release is not directly related to the song
as performed in the film The Line, The Cross and The Curve. That is to say
it is not a still from that protion of the film when Kate sings MoP. It is
however a still from another scene in the film. If I remember correctly this
part of the film came after the MoP segment and just before Eat the Music
when Kate is chasing the Miranda Richardson character.

I expect that someone at the record company decided that the image
was likely to grab people's attention in the record shops and so
suggested that it was used on the cover. I have no idea whether Kate
herself was involved in the choice. 

As for the skulls scene one must remember that Kate has been dragged through
the mirror over to the "other side" - presumably Hell, and therefore
the images from this part of the film will be rather dramatic at times.
However, to answer Derek's question - no I don't think Kate is being
bizarre in the film as the sequence for MoP is very undramatic in
the visual sense with Kate floating round and round against a starry
background - with other people floating past towards the end of the
song. My bet is that someone else chose the cover art for MoP without
correlating it to the song.
