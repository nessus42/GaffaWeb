In article &lt;Pine.3.05.9401051138.A13488-b100000@atlas.cs.upei.ca&gt; fmcquarr@upei.ca (Fiona McQuarrie) writes:
&gt;Happy New Year!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Over the holidays I had a visit with some people who are involved in
&gt;the music business, and of course raised the subject of Her Good Self. Some
&gt;interesting issues were raised and I thought I would pass them along.
&gt;......
&gt;- TRS is doing a lot less well than expected, and the sales figures
&gt;reflect it. It sold really well for the first couple of weeks when all
&gt;the fanatics were buying it, but has dropped off dramatically since then.
&gt;The singles have not done enough to pick up a significant number of
&gt;"new" buyers of the album.
&gt;.......
&gt;
&gt;- Those present were very surprised to hear that Her Greatness did an
&gt;"in-store" appearance. This was taken as further evidence of TRS' not
&gt;doing too well.
&gt;

In a past post I speculated that Kate probably has a higher fanatic to
casual fan ratio (who are more likely to rush out and immediately buy the next
release) than most other artists. By now I would think that this would
come as no surpise to the record company that for the most part "the party
is over" and to stamp out CD's at a lower rate.

Given that the album just came out when she made her appearances, I can hardly
see that as a reaction to poor sales. I would believe that the trip was planned
well in advance as a "support the release" effort, not a "save the sinking ship"reaction.
