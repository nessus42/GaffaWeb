God, this is dedication!  Half an hour overtime and I'm still here!  Okay,
okay, it's just an I hate work day.  What I wanted to do was print up a
Kate blurb I saw in Maclean's.  I hope I'm not repeating something someone
else has done.

Testing the Limits

Kate Bush is still pushing the boundaries both of pop music and of herself.
 Almost four years in the amking, the 35-year-old British pop diva's new
album, The Red Shoes, is a plush mixture of danceable tunes and soulful
ballads.  "It's the most personal album so far," says Bush.  "I wanted to
get the feeling of the band - more songs, more simply expressed, with a
more human energy."  As well, Bush recently wrote, directed and starred in
a 50-minutes film, The Line, the Cross and the Curve, her version of the
famous 1948 movie The Red Shoes.  A dreamlike tale of a woman (Bush)
tricked into wearing a pair of magical red ballet slippers that will not
let her stop dancing, the movie, it turns out, had a real-life corollary. 
After not dancing seriously for about five years, Bush directed herself
into a role where she not only had to dance, but had to do it in ballet
shoes.  "Here I am, past 30, getting up on pointe," she recalls.  "It was
great."  But new experiences, even for a pop superstar, carry a price.  "I
had never realized that ballerinas went through so much pain,"  Bush says
with a laugh.  "It's completely painful."

End.

The blurb comes with a tiny 2" x 2" shot of Kate, She is wearing a print
blouse with a gold chain.  Her hands are "holding" her head up.  She looks
tired actually.  My parner points out that John did not take this picture
and that this is why.  Only he should be allowed to photograph Her
Greatness.

Andrea.

Strange party, this.  There's hundreds of people here but I can't see
anyone, nobody's talking and I keep getting handed these little notes.
