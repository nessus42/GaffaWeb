REGARDING                ETM, &amp; JLC
people:

Apologies if this has already been posted. I really haven't been able to
keep up of late...

For your edification and amusement, a passage from The Joy Luck Club by Amy
Tan with reflections in Eat the Music:
------------
I was sixteen...

"Ying-Ying" he called hoarsely to me as he rose from the his chair. "Maybe
you are still hungry, isn't it so?"

I looked around the table, smiling at everyone because of this special
attention given to me. I thought he would pull a special treat from a large
sack he was reaching into. I hoped for some sweetened cookies. But he pulled
out a watermelon and put it on the table with a loud _pung_.

"_Kai gwa?_" - Open the watermelon- he said, poising a large knife over the
perfect fruit.

Then he sank the knife in with a mighty push and huge mouth roared a laugh
so big I could see all the way back to his gold teeth. Everyone at the table
laughed loudly. My face burned from embarrassment, because at that time I
did not understand.

Yes, it is true I was a wild girl, but I was innocent. I did not know what
an evil thing he did when he cut open that watermelon. I did not understand
until six months later when I was married to this man and he hissed
drunkenly to me that he was ready to _kai gwa_.
------------

The imagery is even more chilling than that in the song, yes?

just me,
to'c
