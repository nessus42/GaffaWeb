<PRE>
A few days back two or three Love-Hounds referred to a very recent Kate Bush
Club Newsletter as "No. 16".  As there were at least twenty-four at last
count, IED found this reference obscure.  He shudders (because he has only
received two or three) to consider the possibility that "16" refers to the
number of little (four-page) updates, or mini-Newsletters, that have appeared
since the virtual folding of the  old Newsletter seven or eight years ago.
  Can anyone confirm this?  Does anyone know the precise number of such
official post-Newsletter bulletins (not counting the one-off deluxe issues
that appeared in support of album releases in 1989 and 1993) to date?  IED
would be grateful for the information.

To answer Chris's question about "Strange Fruit", IED was impressed by the
quality of Kate's workmanship in bronze, though not really surprised -- in a
couple of early drawings published more than fifteen years ago in old KBC
Newsletters she showed, IED thinks, a real sensitivity for contour and a keen
sense of rhythm as an amateur draughtsman.  These are gifts that will hold
one in good stead in the craft of wax modelling.  To be completely honest,
the aesthetic effect (or perhaps it was just the attendant apotheosis of
vaginal motifs) of the piece was mildly repulsive to this viewer; he can't
pretend otherwise just because of his love for Kate Bush's artistic
personality.  This is perhaps more an issue of temperament or taste than of
artistic validity; and IED can say that "Strange Fruit" clearly, even
powerfully, conveys the concept which she has said she had in mind.  (IED
reads this back and recognizes the tone to be uncannily like that of now-dead
crotchet Eric Fenby, who supersiliously though fairly received Kate's
"Delius" video with just the
kind of patronizing blurbage we see above.  Alas, IED rapidly approaches the
incalculable fuddidudditude that Fenby had reached by 1981!)

Best wishes to all, and effusive thanks to those stalwart philocanines who
generously put up so many excellent photos of Kate's bronze.  A priceless 
service to the rest of us!
