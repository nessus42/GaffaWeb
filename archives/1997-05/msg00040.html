&gt;April's Q Magazine reports that:
&gt;
&gt;"Spacial-elasticity-in-rhythm is promised by drum 'n' bass kingpin,
&gt;Goldie, who is planning to stretch his "21st Century jazz" across a double
&gt;album in the summer.  The provisionally titled Saturnz Return will feature
&gt;Noel Gallagher, Underworld's Karl Hyde, and, if Goldie can entice her to
&gt;the metropolis, Kate Bush".
&gt;
&gt;We can only wait and wonder!

Thanks for sharing this with us.  Mind you, the conditional phrasing of the
news item makes me suspect that perhaps nothing will actually come of this.
Goldie -- I have to admit I've never heard of him before, but then I don't
get out much -- may simply have said something like, "Oh, I'd love to have
Kate Bush on my album!"

However, if it did materialize, I wonder if the drum 'n' bass kingpin would
be wise enough to engage Kate's services for something other than vocals.
The focus of our collective affection is a supremely talented composer,
musician, lyricist, and producer -- but whenever she's called in to make a
guest appearance on someone else's recording, she's invariably used as a
backing vocalist and nothing more.  As if she was just another singer, as
if that was the most interesting thing she can do.  I'm not knocking her
singing voice, OF COURSE, but she has a lot more to offer.  A really
sensible artist with taste and discernment would say, "Kate, you use the
Fairlight better than anyone else.  Would you come up with some cool sounds
for this track?"  An even braver soul would say, "Kate, would you produce
this track?"  I think I've heard that she has rebuffed requests like this
in the past, but just asking her would still show discrimination and
insight.
