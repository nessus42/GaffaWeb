&gt; I just found
&gt;out that the 12" vinyl single of Running Up That Hill is one of pop's
&gt;rare instances of a three-sided record -- that is, there is a double
&gt;groove on one side which plays different versions. At least it was in
&gt;the UK -- my Australian copy doesn't have it.
&gt;        Bigz in Bangkok.


I guess everyone has cleared up that this is the Sensual World 12" single.
Quite a lot of fun when it came out; not knowing that there was a double
groove I mystified myself by "losing" Kate's vocal . . . quite hilarious if
you had been there and seen my confusion.  Got a good laugh out of it myself.

OKAY!!! DETAILS PLEASE!!! No fair popping up and saying you've gotten your
anniversary copy of TKI without describing it!  What does it look like?  Is
there a windout groove message?  Is the vinyl black or colored?  Is the
cover exactly the same?  Special printing or varnish? Stickers?  Inserts?
Vial of Kate's bathwater? Please fill us in.

To the poor exasperated fellow who wants to know where the new album is, I
believe Kate is right on schedule isn't she?  We've heard rumors of several
musicians getting calls from her to do some studio work, then nothing.
Perfectly normal; don't get so riled up.

As we know from TRS, the album was finished well before release, but several
months were spent producing the videos and TLTCTC.  Sample tracks
hand-carried to Columbia by Del in the spring (six months before the album
came out) were leaked and circulated at Katemas parties that July -- but
were so far removed from the source recording as to be nearly
unintelligible.  I doubt we can expect THAT to happen again . . .

Kate may do another film.  Anyone else think so?  

Done blathering for today, Karen  kln@staralliance.com
