I can't *believe* I spelled "Jig" as "Jug" in my last post. Just the
other day I misspelled "informative" in a subject line. Pooh!

Just wanted to let all you hyper-educated folks know that, though my
grammer and puncuation stinks, I try to take spelling seriously.

ObKaTe: Isn't she beautiful? Jessica mentioned in Ecto that she collects
Kate photos. I do too. We have hundreds of them. I'd never get tired of
looking at her. Our walls are covered with Kate. I keep saying I'll take
most everything down, but I never get around to it. If they fall down,
that's a different story. I don't feel weird about being a 35 year old
woman, and Chris doesn't feel weird about being a 31 year old man, who
have dozens upon dozens of Kate photos/posters covering the walls of our 
apartment. We only feel strange whenever non-Kate people come over. They
*must* think we're out of our minds! We're not weird, we're not dangerous
and we're not so passionate about Kate that she rules our life. We just
happen to like looking at Kate more than silly paintings/pictures that
mean nothing to us. I *like* having a strange apartment! In case you're
wondering, there's much more on our walls than Kate. I have movie posters,
non-Kate album covers (Siouxsie 12" sleeves are terrific for putting up
on the walls!) and lots of other things. 

Collecting Kate photos is a very enjoyable hobby, because she is such
a chameleon. No 2 photos ever look the same. I've never seen that with
any other musical artist or even actress. I have photos of Kate that,
when I first saw them, I had to look twice to make sure it *was* Kate.
It's just so interesting to see her many,many different looks.
