Which is the version i've always used in my .plan.
Has it been wrong all along!? 

the differences being "Run on the ocean" in the first and "One when
the ocean" in the second, "curl of a wave" vs. "curl of the wave",
"and the holy land of water" vs. "in the holy land of water",
"unfurls" vs. "unfurled" ...

darnit, i tihnk i like the second version better. i guess i'm just
used to it. From where comes the declaration that the first version is
"official"?

I'm gonna have to listen carefully tomorrow for the words where there
are differences..


BTW: certainly count me in as Big Sky fan, i *love* that song.
