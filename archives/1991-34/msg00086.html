Woj asked me to post this message, so here it is.  I am sorry for the
delay, but at least it has allowed Eric France time to return....

A couple of years ago I ended all my postings with lines from Edward
Gorey's "Gashly Crumb Tinies".  After I ran out of lines from Gorey, I
restarted the alpahabet with characters known to Love-Hounds.  In the
two years that have transpired since I posted these, players have come
and gone.  Some of the players remain the same.  Newcomers may
recognize some the allusions.  Long-haulers may understand more.

	A is for AMY who fell down the stairs
	B is for BASIL assaulted by bears
	C is for CLARA who wasted away
	D is for DESMOND thrown out of a sleigh
	E is for ERNEST who choked on a peach
	F is for FANNY sucked dry by a leech
	G is for GEORGE smothered under a rug

	T is for TITUS who flew into bits
	U is for UNA who slipped down a drain
	V is for VICTOR squashed under a train
	W is for WINNIE embedded in ice
	X is for XERXES devoured by mice
