                          THE NINTH WAVE
                 Canada's Leading Fanzine Devoted To
                         Dark and Magical
           Music, Literature, Art, Fashion, and Mythology


THE NINTH WAVE is pleased to announce the release of our First Anniversary
issue. This edition, our 4th, is undoubtedly our best ever, featuring an
increased page count (68 pages), printed cover, higher circulation, and
a spectacular array of stories and features including:

* an EXCLUSIVE interview with Kate Bush conducted during her Fall, 1993
  promotional tour
* interviews with Curtain Society, Perfume Tree, Parade, Angry White
  Mob, and Heaven Piano Co.
* feature stories on Toronto Tea Rooms, Mexico's Day of the Dead, The
  Art of the Duel, and "Riot Grrrl" Erotica
* an assortment of prose, poetry, and short fiction
* the usual collection of news, reviews, and other miscellanea catering
  to the dark set

As always, THE NINTH WAVE is available via mail order. The cost is $5
postpaid (cash preferred, or cheques written to Liisa Ladouceur) to:

THE NINTH WAVE
80-689 Queen Street West
Toronto ON     M6J 1E6
Canada

Alternately, you can place credit card orders for THE NINTH WAVE through
The CD Bar's North America wide toll free order line - 1-800-663-1616.
(Note that credit card orders cannot be accepted until after November 23.)


In celebration of our new issue, THE NINTH WAVE will be hosting a release
party at The Rivoli, 334 Queen Street West, Toronto. The festivities will
be taking place on Tuesday, November 22nd, starting at 10 PM, and will
feature live performances by THRIVE and CHAINS OF EDEN, readings by MITCH
KROL (of MASOCHISTIC RELIGION), plus other surprises. Admission to the
event will be $3, or $5 for admission *and* a copy of our (literally)
hot-off-the-press 4th issue.

For those of you in the Toronto area who can't make it to the show (even
though there's no reason why you shouldn't - I mean, what ELSE is there
to do on a Tuesday night? heh), THE NINTH WAVE #4 will be appearing on
store shelves throughout Toronto very soon. Look for it at The CD Bar,
The Beguiling, Penny Lane, Siren Gift Concepts, Sonic Temple, and other
places.


So, thanks for your attention, and remember - even though THE NINTH WAVE
is largely the work of three people (Liisa, Sheryl and myself), we welcome
your contributions, so send your stuff - words, pictures, sounds, whatever
- to the address above, or via email to gclow@octrf.on.ca
