<PRE>
This is a test message to see how reading news through Netscape
looks.  From, what I've seen, it's the ONLY part of Mosaic 
Netscape that's less-than-mind-blowing.  (In fact, it's downright
horrible!  The Newsreader for AOL is better than this!  I think
I'll stick with trn, thank you).

But while I'm here, I thought I'd mention a couple of things:

I solved a long-running Lovehounds mystery!  You know that line
that no one can make out in "Do Bears..."?  Well, I figured it
out:

It's "Is DRINKIN' God-head?"

It fits.  All the phonemes are there (even if it sounds more like
"Drankin'"), and it fits perfectly with the character Rowan
Atkinson is playing.

Now, here's a new mystery for you English Lit types:
Listening to "December will be Magic", what connection does
Oscar Wilde have with Christmas?  O. Henry, Charles Dickens I
can obviously see if Kate used those as a literary referance.
But Oscar Wilde?  Is there some story of his ("The Importance
of Being Santa"?) I don't know about?

Oh, also those Web addresses I posted a couple of days ago -
You Webheads probably already realized this, but I made a few
typos in a couple of the addresses (Oh, big surprise there!);
basically it's dash-should-be-underscore and vice-versa stuff.
Still, those details are important...

Finally, it's kind of ironic.  Six months ago I had NO Kate
videos in my library (in fact, my entire video library was just
the Hitchhiker's Guide and some Max Headroom stuff); now I got
over 6 1/2 hours worth of stuff.  I realize that that's still
squat compared to most of you long-time collectors, but going from
0 to 6.5 since Katemas is rather impressive, I think.

- Stev0 the omnipresent

P.S. Don't email to this address (yet) - I still need to work a
few bugs out.  Also, I won't be appearing on AOL any time soon
because in order to get this Web thingie to work, I needed to
use my modem port for a direct Net connection (more or less);
Therefore, no AOL or BBS's for me for awhile (Which doesn't matter
'cause this is FAR better).

As soon as all the bugs are out, though, this will be my new
Main Email address.
