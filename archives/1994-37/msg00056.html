&gt;Guess what, everybody - those Lost Betacam Tapes have arrived!  They
&gt;landed on my doorstep on Monday after completing a nearly four-month
&gt;journey all the way from Chicago to Ottawa!  I imagined champagne corks
&gt;popping all over Canada Post for setting a new record for postal efficiency.

   Amazing! 

&gt;The box was clearly opened by at least a couple of clueless drones at
&gt;Canada Customs, who shredded the packaging material enough to leave lots
&gt;of dust, fibres and crap all over (and even INSIDE) the tapes. I cleaned
&gt;everything as best as I could and finally risked trying one at work.  I
&gt;should not have worried so much, for the quality was fine.

    It's been so long since I sent them, I have forgotten what they
were packed in. Sheesh! They must employ gibbons to handle the packages.
Each tape was in a pretty solid library case. Well, at least your morals
were protected. 

&gt;One thing worth noting was that the box was re-sealed with tons of - what
&gt;else - GAFFA(er) TAPE!

   Well, at least you can take pride in the fact that your postal
service is using the finest and most expensive tape around.

&gt;I read Peter Manchester's SON/DAUGHTER OF TAPETREE post soon after this
&gt;and of course was struck by the typically Kate-like syncronicity of
&gt;events. I know Peter's "offer" of a second-chance Tapetree printing has
&gt;been limited to the U.S. for now, but since I finally have these
&gt;wonderful, expensive tapes (thanks again, Chris), I would hate to see them
&gt;collect even more dust.  I therefore (foolishly?) offer to stoke up my little
&gt;combine again for a limited time for my Canadian friends who have not
&gt;already partaken of the fruit of the Tree.  Same rules apply as before:
&gt;e-mail me and I'll send you detailed ordering info. I'd extend the offer
&gt;to non-Canadians, but I think the potential hassles just aren't worth it,
&gt;especially for a relatively small "mopping-up" operation.

   Thanks for doing this. It's good to know that the difficult journey
of these tapes was not entirely in vain. 

&gt;I wonder if those Customs guys ever got a chance to look at the tapes or
&gt;if they gave up trying to find a Betacam deck to play them. I wonder if
&gt;they DID see them and experience a life-changing revelation?
&gt;Oh, who cares?  - I'm just glad they gave them back.

    They probably sent the tapes to Ottawa for viewing, the same place
all the dirty books go. This is an astonishing example. I really cannot
imagine why they don't just have a policy of sending the material *back*
rather than taking so much time, and almost destroying them in the
process.  

&gt;There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic to human behaviour...
&gt;

     How very, very true.
