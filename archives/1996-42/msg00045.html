I share your emotions about Kate.  We have had a similar Kate history. 
I let my Kate records collect dust for many years (my wife didn't like
Kate).  Now I'm divorced and alone and I noticed my old collection of
Kate and the old memories came all back.  I 
especially now appreciate "Symphony in Blue" and "Oh to be in Love".  I
also have a nice collection of Trio Bulgarka. 

I was an author but I spent many years without writing anything.  I put
Kate on on and I started writing immediately and when I introduced my
short story I had requests to put it into different people's homepages. 

My first Kate song also was "Wuthering Heights", I was returning from
school in autumn, I believe 1977.  I'm now 27.  Kate was the background
music of my youth also.

People ask what music I listen and I tell them that I'm a big Kate Bush
fan, few people know her.  I used to live in Europe, more people
appreciated her there.      

I read some fanzines and belonged to THE club and I heard about
rec.music.gaffa I logged onto the net for the first time to see
rec.music.gaffa, must have been 1989 or so. 

&gt; I also am a huge fan of KB. During my early teenage years she was a
&gt; huge influence on the way I looked at life in general and I doubt very
&gt; much if my character today would be the same if she were not part of
&gt; my make-up. 
&gt; I have followed her career avidly since even before her first single
&gt; hit the UK charts. I remember the earliest time was the late Summer of
&gt; 1977 when I met my first true girlfriend and we fell in love , which
&gt; just happened to be the first time I heard Kate's "Wuthering Heights". 
&gt; Over the last few years with pressures of work and a struggling
&gt; marriage (I'm now 30 incidentally) I've lost touch with my true faith
&gt; in KB and it has brought deep emotions back to the fore when I've read
&gt; some of your equally devoted testimonials to her.
