&gt;Theres a rumor going around that one of the tracks that will
&gt;be on Prince's new triple cd is a duet with Kate. The track is
&gt;entitled "My Computer."

Just what we needed, another Windows 95 advertisement.  :-)

&gt;Theres been rumors for quite some time
&gt;that there would be several people guesting on the album so I
&gt;guess it's not entirely impossible although I was unaware of
&gt;any contact they have had since Red Shoes. It could be an
&gt;outtake from the Red Shoes sessions. I thought I had read in
&gt;Details awhile back that they had actually completed a few tracks.

This seems to contradict what we've been told before.  My understanding was
that although Kate and Prince did meet, their collaboration was entirely
remote, and there were no "Red Shoes sessions" as such between them.  They
simply exchanged tapes through the mail.  "Why Should I Love You" was by
way of an experiment, and apparently not an entirely successful one: when
Prince returned the tape to Kate, he had gone far afield of what Kate had
intended for the song, and she felt the need to rework it heavily in order
to bring it back in line with her original vision.  At least, that's what I
read.

On the other hand, I've never read anything categorically ruling out the
possibility that other songs were similarly exchanged.  But I hope not...
