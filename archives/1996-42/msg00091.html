&gt;Hi, all!  I just got the Lovehounds Collections (thanks to a very, very kind
&gt;list member in Hawaii!) and they are so wonderful!  

   On behalf of the many people involved, thank you.

&gt;I have just scores of questions as I watch... I wonder how all these 
&gt;were acquired, and applaud the effort that must have went into compiling
&gt;and editing these tapes... wow!

   Just through normal collecting and trading, but the genesis of it
was during the last Kate Bush convention in England.

&gt; One of my favorites on the tape is the video for Rocket Man... do you think
&gt;the guitar in the chair with the candle is a tribute to her guitarist that
&gt;died? 

   Yes, Alan Murphy played on the track, but died before the video was
made.

&gt; Also, what is the instrument that sounds like a woodwind (kind of), 
&gt;but instead of the musician blowing into it, it's connected to a series 
&gt;of other pipes, it looks like, by some kind of tube... I couldn't for 
&gt;the life of me figure it out (and I call myself a music minor - huh!)  

   That is the Irish bagpipe, known as the Uilean (elbow) pipes. Where the
more familar Highland pipe bag is inflated by blowing into a tube, the 
Uilean pipe bag is inflated with a bellows attached to the players
elbow. It's a wonderful insturment, often compared to the saxophone
in its expressiveness. 

&gt;I had tons of other questions, too, but have forgotten them all... I loved
&gt;the videos she made at De Efteling.... somewhat humorous, but neat, too. 

   Yeah, those have always been a favorite. Unfortuntly, it doesn't look
like we are ever going to get a better version of that.

&gt;And poor Kate during that interminable Night Flight interview!  She has a 
&gt;lot more patience than I do!

   That is as close as we have ever seen Kate to getting angry (although
there have been reports of her be harassed by a photographer to the
point of taking a kick at him.)

&gt;Well, since these were probably discussed ad infinatum when they were first
&gt;distributed, I will sign off now.  Thank you again, everyone who worked on
&gt;them - they're great!

   Thanks again, and we're glad you enjoy them.
