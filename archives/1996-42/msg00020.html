&gt;&gt; Since they're bootlegs anyway, I think nobody would object if you ask
&gt;&gt; for someone making copies for you on the newsgroup.

&gt;Hee hee... Yeah. If you consider Kate to be "nobody." :^) It's a 
&gt;gray area to me. I feel for Kate's privacy, but at the same time, 
&gt;these songs are so precious, that as a big fan, I feel even more 
&gt;enriched to have had a chance to hear them. Others, I know, who have 
&gt;posted their feelings on this matter would just as soon burn all 
&gt;Kate bootlegs in a big bonfire. 


On the subject of bootlegs I have an idea which might leave all parties
reasonably satisifed, but first it is worthwhile setting down a few
facts:

1. These recordings *are* available via an illegal market and can be
obtained from one source or another. However, Kate herself receives
nothing, despite it being her work. 

2. So long as Kate does not release her early material there will always
be a demand for it via an unofficial channel.

3. Although she has disowned her unreleased material and doesn't want
it released, the fact is that the recordings *are* being sold and there
is very little that she can do to prevent it, so there is no point in
debating the moral issue. Whatever her own opinions of her early work,
most of her fans want this material, and someone, somewhere, is willing
to supply it.

So, is their a way for fans to get their hands on these recordings with
a clear, or reasonably clear, conscience? Well, I think there is,
accepting that Kate will never be entirely happy because she didn't want
it released in the first place.

First of all, why don't all those people who currently own a copy of the
'Cathy Tapes' (or whatever title they appear under) send a donation to
Kate personally, as a way of paying her 'royalties' on her work? It's up
to you how much you send, but let's say 10 UK pounds for the sake of
argument. (That is certainly more than she would receive if it was an
official release, but less than you would pay if you bought it full
price from a record store.)

Secondly, anyone in the group supplying copies to anyone else in future
does so on this basis: ask the recipient to send you the blank recording
media *PLUS* a cheque or international monetary order for 10 UK pounds
_made payable to 'Kate Bush'_. You then send the recording to the fan,
the money to Kate, and make sure you make no profit yourself. 

Lastly, anyone wanting these recordings obtains them *only* from someone
in the group who is willing to perform this service, and mentions this
service to anyone else who may be interested.

In this way, the fan gets what they want; Kate gets 'royalties' and has
*some* compensation - if only monetary - for the material being
available when she doesn't really want it to be; and the real
bootleggers out there make little or nothing.
