Hi, all!  I just got the Lovehounds Collections (thanks to a very, very kind
list member in Hawaii!) and they are so wonderful!  I have just scores of
questions as I watch... I wonder how all these were acquired, and applaud the
effort that must have went into compiling and editing these tapes... wow!
 One of my favorites on the tape is the video for Rocket Man... do you think
the guitar in the chair with the candle is a tribute to her guitarist that
died? (you probably discussed this ages ago, but I am a newbie - can't help
it! Not new to Kate, but to the list and videos!) Also, what is the
instrument that sounds like a woodwind (kind of), but instead of the musician
blowing into it, it's connected to a series of other pipes, it looks like, by
some kind of tube... I couldn't for the life of me figure it out (and I call
myself a music minor - huh!)  I had tons of other questions, too, but have
forgotten them all... I loved the videos she made at De Efteling.... somewhat
humorous, but neat, too.  And poor Kate during that interminable Night Flight
interview!  She has a lot more patience than I do!

Well, since these were probably discussed ad infinatum when they were first
distributed, I will sign off now.  Thank you again, everyone who worked on
them - they're great!
