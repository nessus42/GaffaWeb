&gt; Forgive me -- it's yet another KaTe/Tori comparison post.  (But then again,
&gt; I didn't write it -- I'm just sharing...)
&gt; 
&gt; Tori appeared locally a few nights ago.  In a little pre-concert newspaper
&gt; interview, the conversation (naturally) found it's way to the inevitable
&gt; KaTe comparison.  She says she's been hearing it since age 17 and has
&gt; "steered clear" of Kate's music so she wouldn't "sound like a rip-off".
&gt; She went on to say:  "I don't know what our great-great-great-grandparents
&gt; were doing way back then, but maybe their paths crossed".
&gt; 
&gt; Now... my keyboard is just *bursting* with all sorts of (unkind) remarks
&gt; about who inherited the dominant genes -- but I'll just stifle the urge...

I, however, won't...

Just kidding. I like Tori. And I think it's cool that the Kate 
comments she's making as of late seem to be warmer than the ones 
she used to make. And that she's inserted a line of RuTH into 
her concert performances of Love Song (I have this on tape!).

When Patty Smyth ("The Warrior") first came out, she said she 
hoped that the next female artist to 'arrive' didn't hate 
her as much as she hated Pat Benatar -- because the comparisons 
of Patty to Pat were unceasing. In all fairness, though, both 
Tori's and Patty's record companies gave them a shot because of 
their similarities to already established mega-successes. Tori 
isn't a Kate wannabe...but you can tell from the production and 
artwork of "Little Earthquakes" that Katedom was what Atlantic 
(or their UK counterpart) was shooting for.

In the Tori bio, "Silent All These Years," it says that Atlantic 
in America was not happy with the batch of songs that made up LE 
and sent them (and Tori herself) to England. Funny that the 
company's counterpart in the UK (where people have not only 
heard of Kate, but adore her) knew exactly how to market those 
same songs -- behind an album cover featuring Tori in a small 
wooden box, like Kate's US release of TKI.
