&gt; From: Peter Stokes &lt;stokes%cmc.cdn%ubc.csnet@CSNET-RELAY.ARPA&gt;

&gt; I am not an avid KB fan,...

I'm just curious... how does a non-KB fan get signed up for this list?
(It's certainly fine with me -- we're not elistists around here....)
Are you reading love-hounds on a local bulletin board, or did you ask
someone at a redistribution point to add you to the list?

&gt; ... don't know her music and therefore I find it hard to understand
&gt; why she has such a close following by a very select and relatively
&gt; small group of people across the continent.  In other words, what is
&gt; so different about her music??  Why would a "fan club" emerge for her
&gt; when there are thousands of other artists who are much more popular by
&gt; number (record sales, concert sales etc..)????  It is almost like it
&gt; was some kind of cult or religious following....

Kate Bush probably has the most dedicated following of any artist in
the world.  (There was a review for "Cloudbusting" in Melody Maker which
read "Miss Bush's frighteningly intense fans will already know that the
second single from "Hounds of Love" is a dreamy, gentle intense
Sousa-esque matching tune chockablock with the usual whimsy."  Yow, are
we "frighteningly intense"?  The review gave a nice description of the
song too.  To bad it doesn't seem quite overly positive....)

What makes her fans so dedicated?  I guess that to those whom she
reaches, she touches them more deeply than other musicians touch anyone.
To those who she reaches, her music takes them to another world -- this
world.  This world viewed through Kate-colored glasses.  An escape from
reality into reality.  Where one is shown the beauty of ugliness and the
ugliness of beauty.  A world where estranged lovers settle their
differences by turning into mules.  Where electronic swallows and
blackbirds swoop and dive through the recesses of the inner mind.  Where
hounds attack to tear you apart with love and witches try themselves.
Where Irish jigs and African drums and Tennyson poems and movies
about vampires are coherently aspects of One.  Where frustration and
pain are fundamental and essential, but where there is always hope and
love and joy.  A world of infinite pain and infinite pleasure.  A mirror
for all that is important in life.  Life itself.

Uh, er, um..... I'm sorry....

-Doug
