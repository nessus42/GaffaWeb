&gt; From jer:

&gt; It's not breaking plates in "Mother Stands for Comfort," is it? 
&gt; Why do you think that?

Well that's how the breaking sounds were made.  Kate Bush said so.

&gt; I thought it was about adolescent-types living in a "golden ghetto,"
&gt; who go around with their friends making trouble.

I don't think so.  I think it could have two different interpretations.
One is just that when you are scared, your mother's love can help.  The
other is about someone who has done something really really awful, like
commit a murder or something.  And his mother will still love and
protect him because a mother's love for her children trancends morality.

In either case, it's an infinitely perfect song.  I can't listen to it
without tears coming to my eyes.
