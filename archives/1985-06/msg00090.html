&gt;Really-from: Bill Hsu (hsut@purdue.ARPA)
&gt;	Did anyone catch 60 minutes on November 10? There was a article
&gt;on Children's Express, a very intelligent and eloquent group of pre-teens
&gt;and teens who are reporters and who distribute their stories through UPI.

If you lokked closely when these kids were talking to Frank Zappa, you
would seen a shot of three people: Zappa, a woman, and a man.  The
woman was Kim Sargent, who works at WMUC-FM in College Park and was
there talking to Frank. The other man, well it was no other than Ira
Hankin !!!!   Believe it or not...I choked on my beer when I saw that
for the first time...

&gt;Really-from: Bill Hsu
&gt;Just saw the Robyn Hitchcock live album. Neat pictures on the
&gt;back!! How about some reviews of Robyn Hitchcock's concert,

I cant find this album !!! I've looked but have not seen it yet !!!
I also looked at my love-hounds back issues and cant find the review
either, doug. I might have missed some postings...

&gt;As DCoids know, the 9:30 club is famous for starting things on time. 

I showed up at 10 pm, had my hand stamped, went downstairs, then left
to go stand in front of the FBI building (which is across the street 
from the Adult bookstores) and do illegal things that J. Edgar Hoover 
would of had fits over. I walked in at 11 pm, Robyn came on 10
minutes later.  I also met the guy from wayside music, and the guy
who owns Joe's record Paradise (they came together), and some 
of Joe's employee's, and John L. In other words, all the cool people were
there in one state or another.

Me, I thought the show was great !!

&gt;Subject:   Concert Reviews: R.E.M., Del Fuegos, etc.
&gt;Plenty of awards were given out, including T-Bone Burnett as best
&gt;producer (??? what the heck did he produce besides Marshall Crenshaw's
&gt;latest ???), 

Didn't he produce the new Toomy Keene album ?? Not that I like TK, but
I thought he did some work on this one. T-Bone I thought also did some
work with Mitch Easter, what I can't remember. But, this CMJ.

&gt;The audience stomped and clapped until Michael Stipe came back on...
&gt;he then said, "That's it for tonight, but I would like to sing a song,"
&gt;and went into an a capella version of "Moon River"! Gawd!

When I saw them in Boca Raton FL many months ago, they did this for
an encore along with the VU song "Femme Fatale (sp??)" !! Instead
of a capelle, they had Charlie Pickett play acoustical guitar. It sounded
great then !! I think it depends what you expect from them... 

all done....hmmm...later
