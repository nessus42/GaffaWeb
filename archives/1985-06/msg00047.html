(A somewhat belated posting to the LoveHounds community ...)

It appears that Ms. Bush's record company has initiated a
a rather intensive promotional effort on behalf of her current
release. This past weekend while shopping at Olsson's Books
&amp; Records in Alexandria, VA, I was pleasantly surprised to see a 
large EMI promotional poster for her album. (Incidently, I
purchased "A Rebours" (Against Nature), Joris-Karl Huymans'
1884 novel which recounts the 'exotic practices and perverse
pleasures of Duc Jean Floresas des Esseintes, a wealthy aesthete
in search of an elusive ideal.' The book is available in the Penguin 
Classics Paperback series, and I highly recommend it.)
In addition to the poster, while reading the Riffs section
of the latest Village Voice I encountered yet another marketing
effort on Kate's behalf. What follows is the copy from a one-half
page advertisment in the October 22 issue placed by EMI-America
and J&amp;R Music World (a seemingly large NYC record store):
 
          KATE BUSH (printed in 3/4" PS Modern Font)

   Kate Bush's long-awaited new release fulfills the creative
   promise set fourth in her earlier albums. Vividly recorded,
   beautifully produced and performed, "Hounds of Love" marks
   an important step in the continuing evolution of one of Pop
   music's most elusive and engaging geniuses. Contains the hit
   single " Running Up That Hill."


The ad states that Kate's latest album is on sale for $4.99;
in addition, the "Lionheart" and "Never For Ever" albums are
on sale for $4.99.

Incidently, "Cloudbursting" reminds me of Dusan Makavejev's
"WR: The Mysteries of the Organism" (WR refers to Wilhem Riech).
This film was a truly perverse, although oddly entertaining,
view of Riech's work from a socialist perspective (if you can fathom
this.) Perhaps, many of you are aware of Makavejev's more recent films:
"Montenegro" and "The Coca-Cola Kid". I wonder if anyone readers enjoy
his work as much as I do.
 
Finally, I recently recieved a letter from a friend in Germany who
championed the group 'Colourbox'. Is anyone familar with this act?
I am aware of Terry Hall's group 'Colourfield' but not this grooup.

                                  That's all ...
 
                                  G.
