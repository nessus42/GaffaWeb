     Yes, I remember it well!  I had about half a dozen copies which have 
     mysteriously disappeared in the process of several house moves - 
     shame, as it was a very professional fanzine especially for the time.  
     Lots of artwork, colour too as I remember.  A friend of mine has the 
     last two issues, in which there is some rather weird stuff about Kate, 
     probably just before Dale decided to give her up forever.  Nobody I 
     know has heard from Dale or Robyn for years, so what's happened is 
     anybody's guess.  Does anyone remember any of the other now defunct 
     fanzines?
     
     (Once more, sorry about sending back the whole of the digest with my 
     message, can some kind soul PLEASE send me a blank page so I can 
     originate messages?  This archaic system is driving me nuts!)
     
     All the love

So, anyway, it was September 1985, and I had just quit a steady 
bookstore job of five years to move a thousand miles to see if this 
earth-shattering summer romance was for real since she was relocating 
two time zones and we'd been there a week when she decided she didn't 
love me anymore and I drove around the desert staying in anonymous 
motels spending my short life's savings trying to figure out what the 
hell I was going to do now and there on MTV was this w.o.m.a.n. with a 
face and a voice that could turn you into pure white light and she 
leaned over a podium and read from a book and fired a hideously barbed 
arrow saying "I'd get him to swap our places" that reached into my 
chest and eviscerated my life and 
t-o-o-k-m-e-s-o-m-e-w-h-e-r-e-e-l-s-e I mean, yeah, I'd seen bits of 
Hammersmith Live and heard Pat B. do "Wuthering Heights" but, my god, 
this could change your life or make you want to end it or both and I 
didn't do anything about it for a year when I couldn't stand it and 
just didn't show up for work one Monday morning since I'd stolen a key 
to a condo in Florida and drove down to swim out into the gulf and 
disappear but stopped I don't know where in Tennessee I think and 
bought two albums, the soundtrack to "Blade Runner" and what else but 
HOL and hid out listening to Kate before trying to paddle halfway to 
Cuba but couldn't make myself do it and now I hang on her every word 
even though I still don't know why I'm crying, either, but it's 
something bright traveling fast.
Beauty is life.

&gt;Just thought that I would let you know that I heard a great cover of 
&gt;Wuthering H. by a band Called China Drum. It is not listed on the CD, but 
&gt;if you track ahead past the last song on the disc for about two minutes, 
&gt;you get a little treat. Glad to see Kate influencing new bands.
     
More details please. Which CD, etc.
I heard it on the radio a few times then couldn't find a copy. Now I 
know why.

&gt; I just said to a few some Kate fans about the word "graffity" could 
&gt; be abbreviated into the word "gaffity" (pronounced: ga-feet-ee).
&gt; Which obviously would have the meaning to deface property with quotes, 
&gt; lyrics, or images, of Kate.
     
Surely anything associated with KaTe could not be said to "deface" 
property.  You must have meant "enhance".  A slight gaffe which is 
quickly forgiven (or is that 
"forgaffen"?).

TT posted this:
     
&gt;Back in the 80s there was a KB fanzine called Break-Through, published out 
&gt;of Canada by a husband and wife team who eventually got divorced when one 
&gt;of them (The Husband) found Jesus and decided Kate was evil. 
     
Really?! I didn't know about The Husband finding The Big Guy and all, what a 
shame.
No, no, no, not the finding Jesus part, the other part. Whew! Saved myself some 
flammage there I hope!
     
&gt;This was a bad thing, because the magazine, published in tabloid style, 
&gt;was quite good--I dare say better than Homeground at times. 
     
I can't comment on any comparison to the recent Homegrounds, as I only have a 
few
copies from the 80's, issues number 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7, when it was a copy-paper 
version stapled together with those big, bulky staples. I assume it's changed 
over
the years. But I do have one single copy of Break-Through from Aug/Sept '84, and
I
read it every now and then when I need a lift. Chock-full of that wonderful 
brand of fan
worship our Kate brings out in us all, letters, artwork, the cute "Lion Around" 
cartoon,
even a crossword puzzle wahoo! I treasure this particular copy as it has lots of
writeups
on the Bush-Con held in Winnipeg, Manitoba and, at the time, blew me away that 
so
many other people adored Kate too. Who knew that years later I'd be a 
Love-Hound?
     
&gt;Does anybody know what happened to the female side of the partnership that 
&gt;published Break-through 
     
Sorry I can't help out with this one, nobody ever tells me anything!
     
&gt;Let me know if there's anyone out there who remembers this rather fine 
&gt;(in its time) fanzine.
     
I agree with this assessment Tom, the pictures alone in my copy are worth 
having,
as well as some great magazine article reprints from Melody Maker ('78) and 19 
Magazine
from '82. I'm sure you die-hard collectors out there already have the originals,
but I was
thrilled to have these versions. So, there you have it Tom, yes, some of us do 
remember
and miss having this fanzine around. Anyone else?
     
Cheers,

Chris and I used to contribute to it quite a bit. Actually, the 
Bush-Con '84 in Winnipeg was our idea (honest!)
     
I'm hoping to scan in some of the issues for the Gaffaweb fanzines

&gt; BTW I just read on Really Deep Thoughts that Tori has done some verses of
&gt; `Running up that hill' during one of her shows just a few days ago! She does 
&gt; so many covers it had to happen sometime... I am *so* curious as to how that
&gt; would sound! Maybe it'll be on a boot soon (probably by the end of next week).
     
Was this confirmed on Really Deep Thoughts...or were you just 
reading my post on rec.music.tori-amos? I'd seen Tori at the 
Greek here in L.A. on 6/29, and thought that she sang a bit of 
RUTH during her cover of the Cure's "Love Song." I posted a 
question on rec.music.tori-amos, but so far, it has gone 
unanswered. So I've re-asked:
     
In the middle of this track on 6/29, Tori sang the lyrics "If I 
only could...I'd be running up that...rock." Are these lyrics 
regularly found in the Cure song...or was this a snippet of Kate 
Bush's 'Running Up That Hill' (the melody even mirrored RUTH)? 
Did anyone else notice this on other dates?
