     Dear Love-Hounds Digest,
     
     Re. the Katemas gatherings.  Thanks for mention of the Glastonbury Tor 
     one in England.  All welcome!  Organised by myself and Matt Adams, it 
     will be over the weekend of 27th/28th July.  Please contact me for 
     details.  Briefly, folk will meet up in Glastonbury, go to the Tor, 
     eat picnics, quaff cider/Fruitopia, and we will have a home-made very 
     chocolate-y fudge cake, complete with candles (no need to blow them 
     out, the wind will do it for us!).  Card to be signed by all present 
     and posted to Kate.  Lots of things to do in Glastonbury, which is a 
     very spiritual place, so no-one need get bored.  Why not come and meet 
     some new friends?  Matt and I will be there from Friday, we will try 
     to post up a note in the Assembly Rooms (ask in Tourist Information, 
     High Street, for where it is) detailing how to meet up with us.
     
     Thanks!
     
     Finally, sorry about the clumsiness of this message which wll re-send 
     the whole of the digest I suspect - problems here at the college mean 
     that we cannot originate messages at the moment, only reply to them.  
     If some kind soul could send a blank "page" from the L-H digest, we 
     will be able to send less bulky messages.
     
     Bright Blessings,
     
     
     
     Krys and Matt

Hi all......
     
i was recently at my favorite record store in minneapolis and found an lp 
called "Kate Bush Mini LP" (cat. number MLP-19004, released via EMI 
America)).  This full sized lp contained the tracks:
     
Side one:
Sat In Your Lap - 3.29
James And The Cold Gun (Live Version) - 6.20
Ne T'en Fuis Pas - 2.33 (notice the difference in spelling of "fuis" vs. 
"fui")
     
Side two:
Babooshka - 3.20
Suspennded in Gaffa - 3.56
Un Baiser D'Enfant (The Infant's Kiss) - 3.00

Hi,
     
    What you found was a Canadian release of "Kate Bush".  In Canada they
released it in
black, blue, red, grean, yellow, white and brown coloured vinyl.  There's also 
a
US release of this mini-LP but it has 5 tracks (it's missing Ne t'Enfuis Pas). 
The
US release has the same cover but it was only released in black vinyl. 
     
    As for the tracks themselves,  they are all found in the boxed set.  The
credits
on Ne T'Enfuis Pas are for the lyrics  (being in french, of course).   Kate 
apparently 
needed help.   
     
    The cover is a picture of Kate in the Babooshka video. 
     
    BTW,  you can find a different mix of Sat In Your Lap on the 7" and a
different mix of Ne t'Enfuis Pas on the There goes a Tenner 7".  
     
    I hope this helps
     
     
peace
     
ron

&gt;Now I'm all messed up....  I'm way behind in reading L-H, but I've caught 
&gt;bits and pieces about the Katemas party in San Francisco.  I originally 
&gt;read (was it on Ecto?) that the SF party was going to be on July 28th, so I 
&gt;asked my brother if he was free that night and wanted to go.  Now I read 
&gt;that Bill's having one on August 3rd.  Is this the same party, or is there 
&gt;more than one around here?
     
Some people had assumed that it would be held the weekend of July 
27-28, probably mainly because historically they've usually been held 
the weekend before Kate's birthday rather than after.  
July 28th had been assumed by a few people, but nothing had been 
officially announced.  I ended up selecting August 3rd because it fits 
a little more easily into a few peoples' plans, not least of them me., 
and because that's the day meredith and woj are having their Katemas 
gathering in New Jersey.
     
I invite other Katemas hosts to select August 3 as well.
     
&gt;P.S.  Hey Bill, could you jot me off a quick private note and tell me what 
&gt;usually goes on at the Katemas gatherings here?
     
A bunch of obsessive Kate Bush fans will sit around and listen to 
rarities and watch the latest tape tree.  IED may bring along another 
round of his reknowned Kate Bush Jeopardy!.  Someone will probably 
provide Fruitopia.  Stev0 will dis some web sites that use frames.
     
So: the date is definitely August 3.  Plan on the get-together 
starting sometime mid- to late-afternoon.  And watch this space for 
further news.

&gt;Can anyone give me any information about the piece of sampling in

     What's being said is the following: "In a point of fact it is possible
to tell the difference between a small nuclear explosion and a large one by 
a very simple method. The calling card of nuclear bomb is the blinding flash 
that is even more dazzling than any light of earth - brighter even than the 
sun itself, and it is by the duration of the flash that we are able to 
determine the size of the weapon. After the flash, a fireball can be seen to 
rise sucking up under the debris, dust and living things around the area of 
the explosion and as it ascends it soon becomes recognisable as the familiar 
mushroom-cloud. 
As a demonstration of the flash-duration, let's try and count the number of 
seconds for the flash emitted be a very small bomb, then a more substantial, 
medium sized bomb, and finally one of our very powerful high yield bombs."
     
   Hope this has helped.

To add your party to this list e-mail Karen at kln@a.crl.com with the relevant 
information.
     
What the heck is Katemas?  A celebration of Kate Bush that falls on or near her 
birthday, July 30th.  Love Hounds around the world gather to listen to Kate's 
music, sing Kate's songs, watch Kate's videos, debate details of lyrics, look at
     
Kate posters, exchange and/or sell collectibles, show off treasured items, tease
     
each other mercilessly, admire the stereo equipment of the host/ess, wear Kate 
tee shirts, play Kate Bush Jeopardy, eat lots of -- you guessed it -- chocolate!
     
     
     
If there's no Katemas party in your area, why not throw one?  All you need is a 
love of Kate.

This is also the date of the Sarah McLachlan/Susanne Vega concert up at 
Berkeley.  Will KaTeMas start early enough for folks to hit both?

For the record, the word should (which IED 
likes, btw) be spelled "gaffiti", not "gaffity".
     
Kyle asks about the mini-LP.  The six-track edition 
which he has come across is the Canadian edition 
of a compilation of tracks designed to promote 
Kate's work to the North American market.  The 
U.S. version contained only five tracks (guess 
which one was missing).  
     
As for the writing credit:  Chandler and Jeaneau were 
"friends of Kate's" who helped her with the final version 
of the French lyrics for the song "Ne t'enfuis pas".  They 
also wrote the translation of "The Infant Kiss" for
"Un baiser d'enfant".  
     
The Canadian mini-LP was notable (and somewhat valuable) 
mainly in its many different colored-vinyl pressings.  IED 
assumes that Kyle's is a black-vinyl version, in which case 
it is less valuable (?).
     
As for the source of the monologue in "Breathing" about 
which Dave Watkins asks:  it's IED's vague and unreliable 
memory that the recording derived from a BBC-TV 
documentary film about the nuclear age.

And who wasted her fingers, since my (so far only text based) web lyrics:
 <A  HREF="http://home.cray.com/~btd/kate-bush/song/br">http://home.cray.com/~btd/kate-bush/song/br</A>
has it already (and has for a long time). Sorry Emmy, I'm not getting 
at you, but most of what is heard on most tracks is in under:
 <A  HREF="http://home.cray.com/~btd/kate-bush/">http://home.cray.com/~btd/kate-bush/</A>
either a search, one, or two clicks away.
OK, I've still some to get just right, but it WILL be done before the 
end of this month, hmmm, I wonder what that is?
     
OK, I'll confess, I'm part of the Gaffaweb project, and I'm working 
on auto making these HTML, with all the web pretties (background, 
pictures, references), but the text based lyrics will still exist, 
since I know lots of people like fast downloads or have slower 
connections (modems, etc).

Hey, I know that I started listening to lots of other muscians from 
developing a taste for music like Kate's, or Tori's.  That, along with 
the recommendations of friends and love-hounds, is why I got my first 
album by Sarah, and Jane Siberry, and Happy...and heck, even Roy Harper 
for his KaTe Konnection.  So, why have this limited-resources mindset?  
Folks that delve will find Kate.  She's there, one link away from the big 
headliners.  Not that I'd mind a tour...:)
