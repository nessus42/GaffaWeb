In reply to Hofmann, I agree that the getting of new sounds out of guitars is
something to be explored (those same old rock cliches need updating), after all
isn't that what Fairlights are for?

When I mentioned Glass, Tomita and Fast, I had no intention of being examples
of an elitist group.  I was simply trying to contrast musicians who use
mainly synthesizers to create textures and sound montages which are interesting
and different with Hof's (presumably) villians, such as Hi-NRGers who give
synthesizers an irritating name.  My comment on Glass still stands, though.
But, I agree, that as is the case with most 'Classical' musicians, it takes
a considerable time for their music to reach classic status.

Although Tomita is the most commercial of three synthesists I mentioned, he
bears mentioning for his pioneering work in 'true synthesis'.  I'm sure
that few people laugh when they hear 'Snowflakes are Dancing' from which
even Kate Bush ripped off a sound (although I would also entertain the
possibility that she never heard 'Snowflakes' so arrived at a similar sound
by herself) [ the sound to which I refer is the modulated 'whistling' on
Never For Ever'].

Isn't 30 years a little long a period to consider a fad?  The industrial
revolution, should therefore also be looked at as a fad, I guess.
