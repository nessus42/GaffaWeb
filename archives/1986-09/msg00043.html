&gt; [From Shelli:]

&gt; What is that duet?  "Don't Give Up"?  Anyway, my friend said she saw
&gt; the VIDEO for it on V66 the other night and said it had something
&gt; like "I'll be your cowboy and you be my cowgirl" in it.  Is this the
&gt; right song?  I haven't heard it yet.  She also said she saw the
&gt; video for "Indoor" by Clannad.

The duet is called "Don't Give Up".  I haven't heard it yet.  WFNX has
the record and last night I called up N times to request it.  They
played "Sledgehammer".  They played "Wuthering Heights".  They played
"Games Without Frontiers"!  But they wouldn't play "Don't Give Up"!
Finally, one of the DJs told me she *really* wanted to play it, but
couldn't because it's a new record and it's in a certain pile and she
didn't have anymore slots in her playlist for that pile....

In any case, I dunno about this cowboy, cowgirl thing...  There's a
song that used to be the number one song on WFNX called "I Wanna Be
Your Cowboy" and the lyrics went something like "I wanna be your
cowboy.  And you can be my cowgirl.  I wanna be your cowboy....".
But it had nothing to do with PG or KB.

			Don't give up,

			Doug
