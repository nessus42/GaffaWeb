How can you overuse a musical instrument.  Those comments by Hofmann concerning
the proper amount opf synthesizer a piece should have are so absurd they are
hard to take seriously.  Hof, wouldn't you say that Chopin used a little
too much piano in most of his work, or maybe there was a little too much
brass in Herb Alpert's band?  Why should a synthesizer be treated any 
differently than conventional (older) musical instruments?  There hasn't
been a synthesist that I respect that has gone around trying to imitate
conventional instruments.  As to the comments about 'organ imitation' (not
to be confused with the organ imitation employed by heavy metal guitarists
with a sexual identification crisis) this is, I believe, a deplorable use
of ther instrument. 
The only multiphonic electronic kbd I ever owned was a Univox string synthesizerand it did only one thing, that's right, sounded like a phase modulated,
slightly distorted string section (when played properly, and its amazing how
misused that particular instrument was for about 6 years in the mid 70's).
When scoring a composition for an electronic music class at McGill, I penned
in 'PM-Strings' (phase modulated Univox), I was told by the lab assistant
'THERE IS NO SUCH INSTRUMENT AS STRINGS'.  Maybe there wasn't before string
synths, but there certainly was after.  I didn't want a string section in the
piece, I wanted PM-Strings.  Today we have sophisticated electronic music
personnel (I hope) who understand such concepts.  Unfortunately we also have
people like Hof who want to cling to the safety of conventional musical
expression.
I also resent the mentioning of Kate Bush as an example of someone who is
apart from the rest in that her overuse of synths is ok.  Get it straight,
there are synthesizers and there are Fairlights.  While using a Fairlight
as does Kate, shares a lot in common with some synthesizer techniques, the
whole technology of sampling musical kbds (notice I didn't say sampling
synthesizers which is a misnomer) opens up the world of 'real sounds' (i.e.,
not synthetic) for use in a musical context.  Ive noticed (now that I have
the whole set) synthesizer use (CS-80 and the like) is much more restrained
on HoL than it was even on Never For Ever.  Kate is an exectpional pianist,
and a master of the use of a Fairlight, but I've seen no evidence of any
sort of exceptional synthesis on any of her stuff which can be attributed
to more than excellent overall keyboard dexterity.  Also, the album credits
usually point to another musician when a 'real synthesizer' is included
anyway.
I do, I guess (I'm trying hard to be objective here) see how someone could
believe that Hi-NRG music has too much synthesizer.  Such an opinion can
easily be explained by lack of understanding of fundamental concepts.  If
Hi-NRG is supposed to sound like it does then it has just the right amount
of synthesizers.  There is a general concept here, Hof, ANYTHING THAT SOUNDS
THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED HAS THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF EVERYTHING IT HAS. Period.
You can criticize the work, you can criticize the gendre, but saying that
Hi-NRG sucks because it has too much synthesizer is the same as saying that
Vivaldi's music sucks because it has too much violin.  Hi-NRG would probably
suck if it was played with congas and digeridus.
Away from Hi-NRG and other pop styles where synth is prominent, there is a
serious side of pop synthesis.  Philip Glass, Tomita, Lary Fast are among
the most easily mentioned examples of serious synthesists.  Glass, being
the most radical member of this set in that in the future, when Butthole
Surfers are forgotten, Glass will probably be revered as a classical composer.
In closing, synthesizers are instruments.  They should be considered equally
with their longer lived cousins.  A musical composition, should not be
evaluated based on the instruments with which it is played but on the time
tested critical evaluations of the quality of the final product.  Shit
will sound like shit no matter what it is played on.

Maybe if Coitus used more synths.... (sigh)
