Mini-reviews time again!!

Disclaimer: These are just things I picked up recently. It's pure coincidence
	    that 1) most of these are American bands 
	         2) most of these bands are not hardcore
	    so they just happen to be relevant to recent discussion. See,
	    it's synchronicity again...



ART BEARS	THE WORLD AS IT IS TODAY

	This is biting political music, quite unlike the static, 
frozen-in-time quality of the Winter Songs album. Much more jazz-tinged than
Winter Songs, with some gloriously satirical fake operatic arias and atonal
mini-jams, just so you don't forget who you're listening to. Great stuff;
if you don't like venomous political lyrics, just listen to the great
playing. (The album has a beautifully detailed B&amp;W cover, and comes with a 
neat booklet with lyrics and drawings.)


SONIC YOUTH	CONFUSION IS SEX

	I thought Bad Moon Rising was better, but that's like saying
The Dreaming is better than Hounds of Love. CIS is an earlier album,
and has the trademark Sonic Youth jangling guitar noise, but the music
and lyrics are simpler and less atmospheric than Bad Moon Rising. Some
good songs nevertheless.


CHRISTIAN MARCLAY	RECORD WITHOUT A COVER

	I found this somewhat less interesting than expected. Marclay
plays records: he cuts them up, glues them together, scratches them,
makes collages, etc. The album (there's only one side) starts quietly,
then builds to a zany collection of musical fragments. There are some
hilarious moments. His performances must be something to watch...


NEGATIVLAND	NEGATIVLAND

	More collage music. There are 20 short tracks, peppered with
found speech, radio broadcasts, industrial noise, etc. I really enjoyed
the warped music on Side 1, from the fake carnival anouncement ("Welcome
to Negativland...") to the acoustic-folk stuff with industrial noise.
Side 2 is more disjoint, with more noise and speech and fewer instruments.
There are some truly haunting post-holocaust soundscapes, tho.


CHRIS D./DIVINE HORSEMEN	TIME STANDS STILL

	Raw, mostly acoustic street folk. Chris D. screeches his lyrics
of degradation and despair to sparse instrumental backing, mostly
acoustic guitar and wailing violin. This is what Robyn Hitchcock might
have done instead of I Often Dream of Trains if he had lived on the
streets.


	Most of these albums can be ordered from New Music Distribution
Service (mail me a note if you need the address). Your local Tower
Records probably won't carry them...
