Let me start this with pointing out that I forgot about alot of really
good English bands ... including:

Rudimentary Peni
Sacrilage (London)
and Part 1

The rest?   Well, I ain't gonna say anything since it's obvious others have
made up your mind for you ... Hi NRG?  *GGGGAAAAGGGG*
&gt;&gt;True, not all of us but yes, in general and yes, the Brits do tend to take
&gt;&gt;it and mangle it (MaClaren being the prime abuser). There was a comment where 
&gt;&gt;someone called Amercan music "he-man" music.  If that means, it's an active 
&gt;&gt;yet agressive form, hell yes!  I see this as a compliment (thanks whomever)  
&gt;&gt;But,I'd venture to say this wanker stuff disscussed here is in turn "she-man" 
&gt;&gt;musak.  It's much more passive and introspective and stagnant.  Now that I'
&gt;&gt;ve insulted all the genders, we continue.

&gt;Well, you haven't insulted all genders, just the female.  Your "Hell yes!
&gt;Toss me another brewski, duuuude!" bit was doubtless not intended as offensive
&gt;to males ...

Who the hell are you to speak for females.  Shit, who are you to speak for
males or me?  I don't consider agressiveness a particular compliment, it's
just the w a y   t h i n g s  a r e.

&gt;As I'm a postmodern kinda guy, I often find this more
&gt;interesting than the basics.  (This is not to say that all American
&gt;bands stick to the roots, but they're usually much more reverent toward
&gt;them.)

Define post-modern ... you obviously don't know what you're talking about.

&gt;I thought that Bob was just quoting all the American-testosterock
&gt;cliches as an "Emperor has no clothes" thing, and Hofmann goes on taking
&gt;them all at face value.  Who's right here?  I think some of the
&gt;statements Bob quotes (and I don't know if he believes them) have some
&gt;validity, but most are just ridiculous.  Synths are evil, indeed.
&gt;"Anything new is *strickly* for faggots", hmmm?  The proggers showed
&gt;that you didn't have to be an avant-garde Stockhausen-oid to use synths,
&gt;the syth-poppers showed that you didn't have to be pompous to use them,
&gt;and bands like Cabare
That's right - bandy some obscure names around, think you're real cute don't
ya?  There was a lot of validity in what he said ... not all but some.

Yeah .. testosterock ... but give me more ... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ....

At least it's rock and not disco ... ya know?
