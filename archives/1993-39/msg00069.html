davisg@ava.bcc.orst.edu (Glen Davis) Writes:
&gt; 
&gt; I really think TRS is going to be very popular in the U.S.  I haven't heard it
&gt; yet but the reviews all seem to be very positive.  That coupled with the fact
&gt; that even up here in the Northwest (Oregon)--not exactly a cultural mecca--

Here in South Africa (not a helluva cultural mecca either,
particularly when it comes to the international music scene) RbG has
been getting lotsa airplay, but the radio stations are starting to
lay their hands on tRS and a few days ago someone reportedly played,
And So is Love.  I later cajoled a nighttime DJ into playing EtM (my
first hearing of that) and in return plied him with info I got off
Love-Hounds.  He was astounded at how I (a lowly listener) could
have so much more info than him :-)

&gt; yesterday!  In the morning they played Rocket Man and later played ETM.  Thats

Rocket Man got a lot of airplay here about a year or so ago when the
album was released (Two Rooms) but it has disappeared a bit since
then.

&gt; Secondly, anything happening with that new tapetree mentioned last week or so?
&gt; The one about getting RBG on a tape (I don't have cable TV so will probably
&gt; never get to see it otherwise) and a cleaned-up copy of the Christmas special
&gt; (that would be wonderful).

I am _still_ hoping to hear from anyone who can help out with a copy
of this on PAL as I have little access to hi-tech NTSC-&gt;PAL transfer
equipment.  If worse comes to worse tho, I'll go for an NTSC copy.
