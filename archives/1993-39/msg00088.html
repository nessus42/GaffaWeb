LOVEHOUNDS T-SHIRT UPDATE #5 -- 18 October 1993

I have collected only 23 votes so far.  Come on, I know there are
more of you out there!

(will the person who just said "Do I even have to tell you which
one" please vote again?  I accidentally deleted you before I read
your return address, and I have no idea which one you wanted to vote for)

Does anyone else think the "Triple Kate Superimposed" looks like she is
doing T'ai Chi?  Anybody know if she practices it?

CALL FOR VOTES

At this time I would like to call for votes from the rec.music.gaffa 
community, for the image to appear on the front of the shirt.
Snip out the ballot below and EMAIL (not POST) to me, ericf@netcom.com.
Voting will last until November 1, at which time I will post the winning
image.

Image
     (1) Ninth Wave -- similar to back of HoL album (color)
     (2) Cloudbuster -- from video (color)
     (3) Sensual World -- album cover (bw)
     (5) Ninth Wave -- actual from back of HoL (bw)
     (6) Triple Kate Superimposed (color)
     (8) Kate with peach (bw)

I am not taking votes on 4 or 7 because I don't have decent 
digitizations of them.

NOMINATIONS:

1) Richard Frost (rfrost@jrc.flinders.edu.au) has nominated a color
jpeg of KaTe from The Ninth Wave.  Richard sez:
&gt;This one was scanned from the back of album Volume II of the
&gt;'This Womans Work' box set, using a HP Colour scanner and
&gt;Ofoto on a Mac.
In case you cannot display it, the picture shows KaTe, in her life-preserver,
floating face-up in water, raising her right hand towards the point of view.
Brightly colored flowers float in the water around her.  She has a deeply
tired (? YMMV) expression on her face.

The jpeg is available on ftp.uwp.edu, 
/pub/music/pictures/b/bush.kate/ninthwavecolour.jpg

2) My (Eric France, ericf@netcom.com) submission is taken from the video
for the song "Cloudbusting."  It is an 800x600 jpeg of the silhouette of the
Cloudbuster, manned by KaTe, against a twilight sky.  In case you cannot
display it, the Cloudbuster is a large goldbergian device of levers, gears,
and cogs, with several large trumpet-like muzzles pointing up into the sky.
It was constructed for the video by artist H. R. Giger.

(besides being one of my favorite KaTe-related images, it also contains the
off-handed reference to technology which seems appropriate for a t-shirt
representing this newsgroup)

The jpeg is available on ftp.uwp.edu,
/pub/music/pictures/b/bush.kate/cloudbuster.jpg

3) Several people, including Jerome "Evil Tofu" Chan and Bill "Humble
Pseudo-Moderator not named |&gt;oug" Wisner have nominated the cover of
the Sensual World.  It has been indicated that this image would be
best on a black shirt (I agree).

I have placed the good 900x900 scan of the LP cover in
/pub/music/pictures/b/bush.kate/sensualworld.jpg

4) Alex Gibbs &lt;arg@kilimanjaro.opt-sci.arizona.edu&gt; nominated the 
sand-through-the-hands pic from the promo posters and AOTSW.  
Unfortunately, I don't have a good scan of this one.  Can anyone
upload one?  Preferably with the sand visible.

A t-shirt with this image is already available from one of the
mail-order companies -- I have one, it's pretty good.  The price
and address have been previously posted to this group.

5) Alex has also nominated the other Ninth Wave pic -- the one which
actually appeared on the back of the HoL album. 

I have placed a scan of this, sharpened, on ftp.uwp.edu, in
/pub/incoming/pictures/bush.kate/NinthWaveSharp.jpg. If you PREFER
the one it was derived from, kb-nw-b.gif, please vote #5 and INDICATE
this.

6) Someone nominated the picture with three superimposed images of Kate
in three different poses.  I have uploaded a scan of this to
ftp.uwp.edu:
/pub/music/pictures/b/bush.kate/triplekate.jpg

7) "Super Dave" (dfleenor@nettech.com) nominates the pic from the
back of Lionheart (closeup of young KaTe with braid-dried wavy
hair).  Has anyone got a digitized pic of this?

8) Brian Clayton (clayton@kron.cs.csufresno.edu) has nominated
the picture of KaTe holding a peach out towards the camera (apparently
part of a three-picture sequence, of which one of the other pics
is the famous sand-through-the-hand).  woj (woj@remus.rutgers.edu)
has made an excellent scan of this from a glossy he (or his
housemate) owns.  It can be found in:

ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/music/pictures/b/bush.kate/peach.gif

Alex Gibbs suggests:
&gt;Phrase, Lyrics, etc:
&gt;
&gt;1. "Love Hounds... Suspended in rec.music.gaffa"
&gt;  "Love Hounds" above photo and "Suspended in rec.music.gaffa" below,
&gt;or perhaps the latter only, above photo.  Maybe with the Ninth Wave
&gt;photo where she is "suspended" in water?  Love Hound (singular) might
&gt;even better signify that the wearer is a love hound.
&gt;
&gt;2. Deeper Understanding
&gt;  Obvious choice since it's about computer communication/addiction,
&gt;but only some of it works for a shirt, I think.
&gt;
&gt;Well I've never felt such pleasure.
[...stuff deleted...]
&gt;I pick up the phone and go, Execute.
&gt;
&gt;3. Hello Earth:
&gt;  Goes well with the Ninth Wave photo since it's from that!  Try to
&gt;interpret it as talking about the internet, especially starting in the
&gt;second verse.  The internet interpretation is maybe too thin in the
&gt;first verse.
&gt;
[...complete lyrics to "Hello Earth" deleted...]


OTHER POSSIBILITIES:

It has been suggested that Chris Williams (one of the 
katefans@chinet.chi.il.us) use some of the advanced tools at his disposal
to create some sort of composite image out of some of the digital images
which are generally available.  Chris has indicated he will look into this.

MISC:

Richard Frost has also recommended Serigraphia, Ft. Walton Beach, Florida,
1-800-226-3254 for the purpose of printing the shirts.
