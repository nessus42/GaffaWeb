gaffans:

Haven't seen this info here yet (tho', admittedly my reading of late has
been sparse) and I know some of you may be interested. Got an issue of the
below mentioned cyber sleaze by the way and that's what it is. Sleaze. Your
basic gossip rag (Sharon Stone does have her ego problems, I guess) fresh
from the pen of VJ Adam Curry. I'm sure you'll all immediately subscribe!
(:-) optional in some cases :-)

just me,

&gt;
&gt;Yes, boys and girls, it's sad but true: YOU can now hook up directly with
&gt;the nation's #1 waste of teenagers' time. Just type
&gt;
&gt;	ftp mtv.com
&gt;
&gt;and you'll be treated to a meager selection of video, audio, and other
stuff.
&gt;Who knows, maybe we'll be able to watch Madonna on our workstations in real
&gt;time. Talk about a waste of bandwidth!
&gt;
&gt;This information provided as a public disservice. ;-)


I ran out to mtv.com and got the true low-down (mtv.com:/pub/README):

Welcome to MTV.COM!!!

Well, it's been an interesting startup, I've been learning alot about UNIX
and the Net as I go along, and so far it's been fun.

Here's a brief rundown on this site:

First and foremost I have to make it very clear that mtv.com is NOT
sponsored by MTV Networks. Although they are aware of my cyberspace
dwellings they aren't yet ready to commit to a project like this, but I
have their bessing in spreading the gospel ofcourse ;-)

So this ofcourse means that I am paying for my T1 connection myself, which
is maintained by the fine folks at Digital Express.

Although the startup has been rather slow, look for this site to be really
hoppin' within the next couple of weeks. My personal assistant Ken Clar
(ken@mtv.com) will be posting a weekly newsletter, we'll be putting
bloopers and outtakes up in quicktime format, look for digital presskits
to appear, and yes, even mailboxes for Beavis and Bitthead, huh,
huh,heh.heh.

I intend to post programming grids for MTV along with important
development in the music bizz.

Please also note the "Cyber-Sleaze" which is available through gopher, ftp
or the extended versions which are on the listprocessor, the mailing list
is listproc@mtv.com and you should place the following in the message :

subscribe CYBER-SLEAZE your name

This extended reports are shareware, and donations are appreciated.

This is just the start of mtv.com and I hope that you will enjoy your stay
here. Suggestions and comments are always welcome!

All for now.

Adam Curry
