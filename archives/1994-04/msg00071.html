<PRE>

unfortunately my editor does not seem to have a quote function so I 
will have to go by memory here.
1st - thanks to all the Love Hounds that expressed enthusiasm for my 
Prince/Kate connection theory. I will be responding to you individually 
soon - when I have some free time
2nd - Doug Alan mentioned that in my theory I negelected the obvious 
combination of male and female signs. Sorry. I thought I did mention 
this. True. This is very obvious but does not discount other theoires. 
I don't know about you but I am not the type of person who says that 
one single theory is right and then discounts the rest. If it fits - 
it works, There are all sorts of sorts of explanations of the Prince 
symbol and a lot of them work. One of my favorites is that it supposedly 
resembles a Sanskirt word meaning 'nonsense.' For me, this fits just 
as wel as anything else. Basically, I am saying that there can be several 
things that work, all EQUALLY valid, whether it pertains to Kate or anyone 
else. 
3rd - afriend of mine was at Tower back in Dec. for the Kate appearance. 
Since there are no archives available yet from that period I would be 
interested in hearing from anyone that was there about their experience 
and my frined (who was about #20 in line) would like to hear from the 
guy who was standing next to him. You are named Ken and go to the Columbia 
school of something or other (I'm sorry I forget) - Chicago? My friend 
was in line with somebody else and had red hair - about 5" 10
. He left the line for a few hours under the pretence that he was going 
to use the Mcdonalds bathroom but actually went to Revolutin records 
to buy Prince boots. Oh yeah, he had a copy of Cathy (I won't reveal 
how he got it) for Kate to sign. If you can contact me I would appreciate 
it.
4th - Again, back to you Doug. You mentioned that the image of the key 
and locks goes back to the Dreaming - true enough, but I am mentioning 
a specific reference, not just any key, but the key to heaven. If you 
want to get technical then we can trace the image back even further - 
to the single Wuthering Heights.Probaly the major image in the novel 
it was taken from is the image of keys and locks and doors that cannot 
be unlocked.
