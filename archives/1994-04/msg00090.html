&lt;sigh&gt; this is what I intended to send...


&gt; From: larry@csccat.cs.com (Larry Spence)

&gt; &gt; TRS isn't my favorite Kate album...never will be.
&gt; &gt; "The Dreaming" holds that spot, and always will.
&gt; 
&gt; But then:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm not one to hold Kate to any expectations *I*
&gt; &gt; might have for what she's *supposed* to do.
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like you expect Kate to keep making records that are inferior to
&gt; _TD_... either that or you're so fixated on old releases that you couldn't
&gt; recognize it if she _did_ put out something as good or better than _TD_?
&gt; Yow, _I'm_ more than a bit of a Kate Cynic, but I'd give her a chance to
&gt; pull off a masterpiece again (_TRS_ ain't it, though)...

But, people have favorite albums for different reasons. The Dreaming is my
favorite (ok, so far) musically, but it will always be my very favorite
album for other reasons also.  The album came out 3 months after my mother
had died and it was very important in helping me to focus on something
other than my grief. It and Peter Gabriel's "Security" were what snapped
me out of a miserable fog. They were such intricate and complex albums
and gave me something interesting to *do*, getting to know them and 
trying to figure them out.  Beyond that, the song "All the Love" just
completely blew me away, because of the lyrics, coming to me when they
did. You can imagine, I imagine.

I have deep, deep, deep emotional attachments to TD that I don't have
with any other Kate album, as much as I love them and as wonderful as
I think they are. *That's* why it's my favorite, and that's why it 
always will be.

(many more deeply sincere apologies about that mistake I made earlier)

Vickie

"I didn't want to let them see me weep,
 I didn't want to let them see me weak"  Kate
