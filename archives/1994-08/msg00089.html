&gt;    The _Little Earthquakes_ videos/photos have a number of similarities
&gt; with early Kate videos. These may be coincidences, but I doubt it.
&gt; I don't think Tori is imitating Kate. I think Tori's video director/
&gt; photographer has a pretty good Kate video collection. The most obvious
&gt; direct lift is in the "Crucify" video, Tori and her doppleganger's
&gt; side-to-side hip shift an obvious homage to the "Strange Phenomena"
&gt; video from the _Die Eftling_ (sp?) videos. That and their mutual
&gt; early fondness for footwear verging on fetish items.

I asked Cindy Palmano about these things when I interviewed her
for issue 4 of the Really Deep Thoughts fanzine.  Below are
excerpts from that interview:

RDT:  ... comparisons have been made between the US cover for
Kate Bush's _The Kick Inside_ and the cover photo of Tori for
_Little Earthquakes_....

CP:  I don't know what you're talking about, actually.

RDT:  ...Kate Bush's first album pictured her in a wooden crate.

CP:  Did it?!! I had no idea.

RDT:  When Tori's album came out there was talk among Kate Bush
fans that it might be some sort of reference to Kate.

CP:  There is no such thing as a new idea.  I'll tell you where
the crate came from.  What I make as part of a picture always is
relevant.  It's never there without having a thought process 
behind it and around it or explored, because that's the way I 
work.  The box wasn't there just because it was a box.  I had 
the box made specifically because it was a simplification of the 
idea of _Alice In Wonderland_.  Tori was de-scaled, hence the 
tiny piano, too.

...I really rate Kate Bush, I think she's great.  I'm sure that 
her album cover was good.  Maybe I did see it.  Maybe I have
seen it and maybe it did come up as a subliminal thing.  But who
knows where things come from?  I certainly wasn't consciously
aware of it.

&gt;    You can't copyright a style.

Later in the interview, Cindy explains that Tori and her
stylist, Karen Binns, came up with her "look."  I didn't pursue
that question any further.

After having talked with Cindy about the supposed similarities
to Kate, I am convinced that these similarities were simply
coincidental.
