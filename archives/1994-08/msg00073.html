<PRE>
I put this on r.m.g Tues night but now that everything seems to be
working I thought everyone would want to know, perhaps in time for
Sun night...
-=&lt;*&gt;=-
"And So Is Love" was played on US MTV's 120 Minutes (3/13).  I'm
pretty sure it was directly from the film but I have not been reading
the summaries of the film (to avoid spoiling it for me).  Briefly this
is what was in it: Kate is in a room lighting a lamp and singing.
Later a bird flies about the room and she is able to hold it and then
sets it free, only to have it crash into a window and die.  Very
simple and different for US MTV.  (yay!)

After the video they showed a brief clip of her talking about making
videos and the parallels between that and making music.  She was
wearing a grey shirt and a necklace with a crescent on it.  She said
at the end "So in some ways I think I'm intrigued about the idea of
making a film of some kind that would incorporate music and visuals."
Obviously this sounds old.  Anyone seen this before?  I can transcribe
the rest but it's not much.

After that they said ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about her film!  &amp;$*%@&amp;!!!!
What Lewis Largent *did* say was "Just can't get enough of old Kate.
