-&gt;different interpretation possible.  It says "I am sick *with* love", not
-&gt;"I am sick *of* love."  Also:  the Oxford says "Oh that his left hand were
-&gt;under my head", also quite different.  Does there exist some Bible 
-&gt;that has the words as Kate used them, or did she massage the text to 
-&gt;have a new meaning?

This has been discussed and I think it was Peter Manchester (?) who
indicated that the New King James version (?) contained the same
wording as Kate's song.  I also pointed out that my version had "with"
instead of "of" and that I thought the meaning was love-sick.  Some
agree some disagree (as you would expect).  Her wording doesn't
exclude this meaning.  As one can be sick of the flu, meaning you are
overcome by the flu, one can be sick of love; overcome by love.

-&gt;Is there a video for Song of Solomon?  What goes on in it?

No.

-&gt;LILY:  more Biblical references.  Is this Kate's most 'religious' 
-&gt;album to date?  Has anyone offered an analysis of this text, that
-&gt;is, an interpretation they'd like to share?

People have, yes.  In short, Lily appears to be a real person who is
probably the source of the spoken words at the beginning.  The Lesser
Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram was posted here, which obviously
relates to the song.  I advise against anyone posting the ritual again
but I may have a copy of what was posted before so write me for it.

-&gt;And once again, is there a video for LILY, and what goes on in it?

Yes, it's part of her movie _The Line, The Cross, The Curve_, which
includes RbG, ASiL, TRS, Lily, MoP, and EtM.  I haven't seen it.  It's
been shown publically a total of 3 times now???  (London, Toronto,
Berkeley).

-&gt;I'm glad you brought this up.  Kate has always seemed to have a
-&gt;strangeoj{ interest in the supernatural, but until present she seems
-&gt;to have had a pretty tradition view of 'God' and religion
-&gt;(i.e. christian).

I do agree that she has long had an interest in the supernatural and
spiritual.  I hadn't really thought about how her musical expression
of religious views may have changed but upon reflection I don't think
it has changed that much.  I think it has always been diverse (see
"Sat in Your Lap").  Lily does refer to a magik ritual but other songs
like SoS and "Why Should I Love You" refer to a more Christian view at
times (see my .sig below).  Lots of people have considered her to be
pagan, although to be honest I don't really know why (anyone?) since
her songs seem to refer to a large variety of religions views.

But she has said herself that "...quite often there are things said in
a song that I don't believe at all, but they are beliefs of other
people, and sometimes that's very relevant."  (March _Details_)

-&gt;What I'm basically getting at is the question to all of you of what
-&gt;you think of Kate's religious sensibilities.  Considering lines from
-&gt;song such as "Symphony in Blue" and "Oh England My Lionheart" and then
-&gt;her present interest in the occult and involvement with people who
-&gt;practice it, how would you describe Kate's spiritual beliefs and
-&gt;development?

Explorative perhaps, but otherwise unknown to us.  I get certain
religious and spiritual things out of her music (see my current sig
for one) but I can't say they are what she had in mind and I know it's
different for others.

"My work speaks far more eloquently than I do, and if people get
anything at all out of the tracks, whether it's what I intended or
not, then that's great."  -- Kate from same article
