Wheee!  A flame war that actually takes the "lame" out of "flame"!
The two KateKops are (finally) at it!  For those just tuning in, Chris's
standard Modus Operandi with his enemy-of-the-week is to pull out his resume,
showing he is a MUCH BETTER KateFan (tm) than YOU, how He was a fan since
she was BORN, and personally introduced Kate Bush to David Gilmore.

Jorn, on the other hand, is suffering feelings of a past life of his as
a High Priest of Atlantis.  If his pouting doesn't work (and usually it
doesn't), he'll just give up and throw a bad ASCII graphic at everyone.

Seriously, in this case, it seems like Chris is the "Good Guy".  Hey,
if he doesn't have the equipment, he can't make a copy.  What's so hard
about that to understand?  Now, Chris questions why Jorn would want a
copy of the videotape when he doesn't even have a VCR or TV.  Well, as
we all know, Jorn can just "read the vibes" directly from the tape - he
doesn't NEED a VCR!  (He CAN'T do it with a Laserdisk, though!)

Finally, although I agree with Chris in this one instance, wouldn't it
be GREAT to see Vickie post to the public, "Chris, you're being an idiot,
&lt;insert name of enemy-of-the-week&gt; is right." just once?  Also, wouldn't
it be great if just once, Jon Drukman posted, "&lt;Enemy-of-the-week&gt;, you're
being an idiot, Chris is right."?

You don't have friends" - Peter &amp; Kate singing to Jorn
