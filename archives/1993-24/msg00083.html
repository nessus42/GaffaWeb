I guess Chris got bored of fighting with Jorn cos he pulled this gem
from several weeks ago out of mothballs...

&gt;   Nope. My reaction to hearing the song over the phone _was_
&gt;goosebumps, true. But neither you, I or anyone else has heard the
&gt;only a telephone quality sample has really heard the song. You,
&gt;of all people know enough about the *technical* aspects of music
&gt;to admit that.

i have to say that that is partly why i *haven't* attempted to listen
to moments of pleasure.  i don't want to dishonor the artist's
intention.

but my point in my original letter was to say that you are inventing
excuses for kate.  someone doesn't like the song so you say "well you
can't possibly know if you really like it or not cos you only heard a
lo-fi representation of it."  i claim that if that poster had written
"it was great" you would not have written your letter in the first
place.  i didn't see you following up any of the articles praising MoP
with a "well, hold off on your opinions until you've heard the real
thing!"  i wonder why that is.

&gt;   This was apparently his *first* post, dismissing a new Kate song
&gt;out of hand. As far as your beloved "anarchy" goes, his right to post
&gt;an inane opinion is the same as mine. Look it up.

*you* made an issue out of it being his first post.  everyone has to
have a first post.  you were a relatively hardcore kate fan when you
made your first one, so how do you know this guy isn't?

&gt;   I don't believe it is arrogent to point out the obvious differences
&gt;between the early and later Kate, any more than to point out the
&gt;differences between the earlier and later work of *any* artist.

i say "i don't like this song."  you say "you must have got into
artist X later in their career when they were doing bazouki music
because this song is like their earlier kalimba-based stuff, and if
you had been into artist X since the kalimba phase you'd like this new
track too."  that's the arrogance - presuming you know *why* someone
dislikes something (particularly when your reason is in direct
contrast to what the person actually *said*).

&gt;My point is that those of us who discovered Kate earlier were had 
&gt;our musical horizons broadened as Kate's broadened. Knowing and
&gt;loving _The Kick Inside_, _Lionheart_ and _Never for Ever_ didn't
&gt;prepare anyone for the shock of the single of _Sat In Your Lap_.
&gt;It was one of the things that led me into exploring a lot of other
&gt;music. People who discovered Kate as an "alternative artist" come
&gt;to her music with a different set of preconceptions. They expect
&gt;her to continue in the same vein ("How can you tell if a band is
&gt;'alternative?' Easy, they sound like all the other 'alternative'
&gt;bands.") and tend to dismiss her earlier works and her newer work
&gt;that recalls her earlier style.

that's what you say.  and i don't buy it.  i like all sorts of music.
there's early kate stuff i hate, and there's recent kate stuff i hate.
you don't know how i formed my interest in kate and i'm not going to
tell you.  so don't tell me you know why i dislike a certain track.

&gt;   How's your record doing Jon? I haven't heard a report on it's
&gt;chart progress in, oh, *days*.

it hasn't been seen on any charts in ages.  but our new remix (of
"unleashed in the east" by up above the world) is getting play now and
it sounds *lovely* on a big system.  it's available on twitch volume
11 (a double 12" set, also soon to be on CD), orderable from twitch at
415/751-6740.  tell randall that you heard about it from a jon drukman
posting on the internet.

also look for an upcoming remix of "where is love and happiness" by
alternative pop group Anything Box.  out soon on Orangewerks.

&gt;   "Why pay for one of them fancy-schmancy doctors to do your operation?
&gt;Bob here was sick once, sure he's a plumber, but all opinions are
&gt;equally valid, so I'm sure he could fix you up." Right.

i think it's more a case of, "you have cancer.  would you like western
medicine, eastern medicine, homeopathy, christian science or a bale of
marijuana?"

but you knew that.
