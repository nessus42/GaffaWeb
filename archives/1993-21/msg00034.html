        With all of the speculation about kate's album being based on a 
story (her album title, I should say), here's an early article from the 
KBC about Kate's childhood album likes:

 Subject: Kate recommends books to read, ca. 1979 
 
   &lt;Reproduced from the fourth issue of the Kate Bush Club 
_Newsletter_, which came out in late 1979. It's important to bear in 
mind that at this stage the Club was directed mainly toward very young 
fans--it took a while before Kate and her group realized how many older 
fans there were, apparently. Nevertheless, these books, which are all 
children's books, must be at least somewhat representative of the kind 
of books Kate herself enjoyed at that time.&gt; 
 
                             _Books_to_Read_ 
 
   I thought it would be a good idea to recommend some of the books 
I've enjoyed recently. They would be nice to give and to receive as 
Christmas presents. 
   _The_Snowman_, but Raymond Briggs (Hamish Hamilton). A lovely story, 
told entirely in pictures, of a boy's adventures with a snowman who 
comes to life one night. Beautifully drawn, funny and moving. A real 
delight. 
   _Masquerade_, by Kt Williams (Cape). The riddle book to end all 
riddle books. If you can unravel the clues they will lead you to a 
golden hare that is buried somewhere in Britain. Super illustrations. 
   _The_Stone_Book_, _Tom_Fobble's_Day_, _The_Aimer_Gate_ and _Granny_ 
_Reardun_, all by Alan Garner (Collins). A linked quartet by one of the 
finest living prose writers, though each book is an entity in itself, 
covering eighty years, from 1860 to 1940, in the life of a Cheshire 
family. Each book is only eighty pages long, and a fuller, richer, more 
exhilarating eighty pages would be hard to find. Each story is filled 
with the mysteries and magic of working with stone, wood and metal, and 
each has a stunning set-piece that left me literally breathless--a 
girl's whilrling ride on a church weathercock, a boy's 
climb to the inner tip of a steeple, the thrill of sledging in new snow 
in an air-raid. They are also well made books, with fine etchings by 
Michael Foreman--a delight to hold as well as to read. 
   _The_Haunted_House_ by Jan Pienkowski (Heinemann). Open every page 
and horrific things jump out at you, and there are lots of tabs to pull 
and push and turn to make it more ghoulish. Really good fun. 
   _The_Wind_in_the_Willows_, by Kenneth Grahame, illustrated by Arthur 
Rackham (Methuen). Everyone will know about this classic, but I would 
like to recommend this edition, because it's a good size--it feels like 
a book--and has the superb Rackham illustrations. It's worth having for 
those alone. 
   _Moshi_the_Jackal_, by Tas Gibson (Rex Collings). The life of the 
Jackal, told through the story of Moshi, brilliantly illustrated by one 
of the leading wildlife illustrators. Tas also had a hand in the design 
of our Lionheart logo.    _The_Mouse_and_His_Child_, by Russell Hoban 
(Faber). A brilliant, funny and profound novel following the attempts 
of a father-and-son clockwork toy to achieve self-winding, in the face 
of attacks by Manny Rat, one of the great villains.
