&gt; &gt;      Well, I don't claim to be a musician, just someone, who, after 
&gt; &gt;several years of vocal and instrumental training, (including current 
&gt; &gt;lessons in violin), has some musical background and knowledge.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah.  Violinists are, after all, eminently qualified to judge guitarists.
&gt; 
     Well, as a begining violinist, (1 year), who also has 7 years 
playing nylon acoustic guitar, (6-string), I dare say I may know 
something about how a guitar is played.   (I also play octurna, I'm 
learning penny whistle, and I play around with MIDI.   I don't count 
myself as a musician, but just a music hobbist.)

&gt; As a guitarist, Prince is pretty consistently excellent.  As a songwriter,
&gt; he's hit and miss, I'll grant.  As a producer, he's done some very good
&gt; work too, and to be honest, I was pretty unimpressed with the production
&gt; on Kate's last album, so I'd say it could be a very good thing to have
&gt; Prince on board in that capacity.
&gt; 
    Actually, my first intro to Kate was The Sensual World.    I was 
quite impressed with the production on it...enough so I went out and got 
all her other albums, started getting onto chats about her, etc, etc.

&gt; &gt;some wont.     Do I think his appearance on Kate's new album will harm 
&gt; &gt;more than hurt ?   I hope not.    However, most of the Kate fans I've 
&gt; &gt;told this information too have been rather underwelmed by this 
&gt; &gt;information, and don't feel he would be a help.    Am I willing to be 
&gt; &gt;proven wrong on the matter of his harming the new album ??  Yes, I would.
&gt; 
&gt; You sure don't sound very open to the idea.
&gt; -- 
     Actually I'm quite open to the idea...I'm willing to admit that 
prince might not be a hinderance to The Red Shoes, and that, while I feel 
he do more harm than good, I am willing to be proven wrong.  (as a matter 
of fact, I'd love to be proven wrong, as I'd hate The Red Shoes to be a 
dissappointment.)

   On a personal note, I noted that most of your defence of prince is 
more geared as attacks on me and my musical taste.    Since I have stated 
that these are my opinions, that others may feel differently, (as you 
seem to), may I ask that your comments regarding this matter be confined 
to discussing the matter, w/o personal attacks.    I have not attacked 
your musical taste in any way, please do not attack mine.
