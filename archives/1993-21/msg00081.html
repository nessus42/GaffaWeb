&gt; It's good to see that gaffa is STILL the bastion of fairness and sensibility
&gt; that it used to be.  Of course you have probably judged Prince on what
&gt; you see/hear in the media rather than any merits the man has of his own.
    
   Actually I could care less about the media, or prince's relationship 
therein.    Most american 'musicians' are judged solely on how well they 
handle the media, (for good or bad), rather than if they happen to be 
good musicians.

&gt; But hey, why give him a chance when it's obvious he's just a lame-o
&gt; poser.
 
    All of his stuff I've heard points to the fact that, in my opinion, 
he's a marginally talented poser.    (Note, in both my postings, I did 
say, In my opinion.    For I am stating my opinion, not universal truth.  
Some people, including friends of mine, like prince.   Myself, I promised 
myself I'd rather get a vasectomy via weed-wacker than suffer though 
another viewing of purple rain again.    Sorry, all the stuff I've heard 
of his has been underwelming.)

&gt; 
&gt; Never mind that he's written some of the best songs of the last 15 years,
&gt; done some incredible production work, and probably has more musical
&gt; chops in his right hand than you have in your whole body; since you
&gt; don't like any of it, it's obviously worthless trash.
&gt; -- 

      Well, I don't claim to be a musician, just someone, who, after 
several years of vocal and instrumental training, (including current 
lessons in violin), has some musical background and knowledge.    Again, 
in my opinion, he doesn't have a great deal of musical talent, just a 
talent for keeping his name in the spotlight enough to insure that the 
media won't forget him.    As for worthless, that's a individual 
question.   Do I think it's worthless, yes.    Do others ?   Some will, 
some wont.     Do I think his appearance on Kate's new album will harm 
more than hurt ?   I hope not.    However, most of the Kate fans I've 
told this information too have been rather underwelmed by this 
information, and don't feel he would be a help.    Am I willing to be 
proven wrong on the matter of his harming the new album ??  Yes, I would.
