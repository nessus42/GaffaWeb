&gt;&gt; It's good to see that gaffa is STILL the bastion of fairness and sensibility
&gt;&gt; that it used to be.  Of course you have probably judged Prince on what
&gt;&gt; you see/hear in the media rather than any merits the man has of his own.
&gt;   Actually I could care less about the media, or prince's relationship 
&gt;therein.    Most american 'musicians' are judged solely on how well they 
&gt;handle the media, (for good or bad), rather than if they happen to be 
&gt;good musicians.

Maybe that's how they are judged as a whole, but that's not how I judge
music.

&gt;&gt; Never mind that he's written some of the best songs of the last 15 years,
&gt;&gt; done some incredible production work, and probably has more musical
&gt;&gt; chops in his right hand than you have in your whole body; since you
&gt;&gt; don't like any of it, it's obviously worthless trash.
&gt;      Well, I don't claim to be a musician, just someone, who, after 
&gt;several years of vocal and instrumental training, (including current 
&gt;lessons in violin), has some musical background and knowledge.

Ah.  Violinists are, after all, eminently qualified to judge guitarists.

As a guitarist, Prince is pretty consistently excellent.  As a songwriter,
he's hit and miss, I'll grant.  As a producer, he's done some very good
work too, and to be honest, I was pretty unimpressed with the production
on Kate's last album, so I'd say it could be a very good thing to have
Prince on board in that capacity.

&gt;some wont.     Do I think his appearance on Kate's new album will harm 
&gt;more than hurt ?   I hope not.    However, most of the Kate fans I've 
&gt;told this information too have been rather underwelmed by this 
&gt;information, and don't feel he would be a help.    Am I willing to be 
&gt;proven wrong on the matter of his harming the new album ??  Yes, I would.

You sure don't sound very open to the idea.
