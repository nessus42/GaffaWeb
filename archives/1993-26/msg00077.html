Photo ideas:

1. Aspects of the Sensual World (sand-through-the-hands):
  This is my first-choice nomination.  I think Kate looks *amazing* in
this photo and it would look good from a distance.  (I do want a
t-shirt and poster of it.  Anyone know where to find them?)

2. Ninth Wave photo (on the back of HOL CD *booklet*, not the back of
the CD case):
  I agree this photo is also a great choice, but not the one from
TWW2.  I think her hand stands out too much in TWW2, especially from a
distance.  She looks much better in the original also, IMHO.  I find
the original to be much more visually _interesting_ and attractive.
It doesn't give itself away immediately.  When I look at TWW2 I right
away see a woman in a life vest in the water reaching out.  But
looking at the original, it takes longer to realize this... it looks
as if it could be some other situation... it holds my attention longer.


Phrase, Lyrics, etc:

1. "Love Hounds... Suspended in rec.music.gaffa"
  "Love Hounds" above photo and "Suspended in rec.music.gaffa" below,
or perhaps the latter only, above photo.  Maybe with the Ninth Wave
photo where she is "suspended" in water?  Love Hound (singular) might
even better signify that the wearer is a love hound.

2. Deeper Understanding
  Obvious choice since it's about computer communication/addiction,
but only some of it works for a shirt, I think.

Well I've never felt such pleasure.
Nothing else seemed to matter.
I neglected my bodily needs.
I did not eat, I did not sleep,
The intensity increasing,
'Til my family found me and intervened.
But I was lonely, I was lost,
Without my little black box.
I pick up the phone and go, Execute.

3. Hello Earth:
  Goes well with the Ninth Wave photo since it's from that!  Try to
interpret it as talking about the internet, especially starting in the
second verse.  The internet interpretation is maybe too thin in the
first verse.

Hello Earth
Hello Earth
With just one hand help up high
I can blot you out,
Out of sight
Peek-a-boo,
Peek-a-boo, Little Earth.
With just my heart and my mind
I can be driving,
Driving home
And you asleep on the seat.

I get out of my car,
Step into the night,
And look up at the sky
And there's something bright
Travelling fast.			(communication satellites, which
Look at it go				 really can look like this.)
Look at it go.

Watching storms
Start to form
Over America				(the rapid internet birth)
Can't do anything			
Just watch them swing
With the wind
Out to sea				(expand to all countries)
All you sailors
All life-savers
All you cruisers			(all you net travellers)
All you fishermen
Head for home				(to connect to the net?? well...)
Go to sleep little earth,
I was there at the birth,		(of the net)

Out of the cloud burst the head of the Tempest,		(net alive?)
Murderer, Murderer, of calm,		(harder to find solitude)
Why did I go?
Why did I go?

Go to sleep little earth

Well, it's an idea.

4. I agree we should get XL or even XXL.  I really like over-sized!  :)

More ideas!
