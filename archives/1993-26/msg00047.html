&gt;While we're kinda on the subject of KaTe Kollectibles...I recently 
&gt;picked up a Hounds of Love limited edition marbleized LP, still 
&gt;sealed and in pretty good shape. I paid $20 for it, and was wondering 
&gt;if it's worth more or less than that. 

I bought the marblized edition of HoL new when it was released for 
about $12 (not much more than the black vinyl HoL).  I have since seen 
it for between $20 and $25 in unsealed well-worn condition.  Since 
it's an item you don't see every day, it sounds like you made a sKore 
to me!  As for its worth, only you can judge that.

&gt;I also have three The Kick Inside LPs (Japanese, British, and
&gt;American covers). Someone told me there are four different covers. 
&gt;What's the fourth one look like?

There are TWO american covers.  The Harvest release (the earlier of 
the two) has a close-up of Kate's face and hand(s).  IMHO, this is not 
a very flattering cover. The second american release (EMI/Capitol?) is 
the more commonly seen Kate-in-a-box one-leg-up cover.  Both have the 
same back cover, but different Kate-alog numbers.  

For true Kate maniacs like me, there is a FIFTH album configuration 
that is a must, (well its PRETTY neat anyway :^) ).  I have a copy of 
an american TKI with the EMI/Capitol Kate-in-a-box cover, but the 
HARVEST Kate-alog number etched, scratched out, and replaced with the 
EMI number, on the album center.  This was obviously issued during the 
transition stage when they had albums left over from the original 
pressing, but were (re)packaging them in the newer jackets.

&gt;And, assuming I can find one, how much would a Big Sky picture disk 
cost me?

I don't Know.... but as long as we're talking Kollectables, I have a 
laminated stage pass to Kate's "Bill Duffield benefit concert".  I 
would ASSUME that this is not a Kommon item, but I'm not sure.  Anyone 
out there with any ideas?
