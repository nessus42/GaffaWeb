&gt; In article &lt;930630130553.2380107c@CCSVAX.SFASU.EDU&gt; you write:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;i'm sure Kate uses him for his guitar-playing talent.
&gt;
&gt; I am a big (and very knowledgeable) Prince collector and I can almost assure
&gt; you that he has written, yes written, a song for her.  He did three songs
&gt; for her, one of which was "With This Tear" which ended up on Celine
&gt; Dion's CD.  He may or may not play any instruments on the track,
&gt; depending on how much of his version Kate ends up using as backing.
&gt; (Celine ended up using her own arrangement I believe...I don't own the CD).

Well - newer information claims that Kate has written everything by herself and
that Prince appears playing guitar and providing bvs on one song. We'll see.

&gt; Incidentally, I don't know how many of you are aware of this, but Prince
&gt; did a one-off radio show in MPLS called the NPG Radio Show in 1989.  During
&gt; his stint as DJ he played a remixed (allegedly by him) version of Love and
&gt; Anger.  It was pretty interesting.

Well again - I asked another very knowledgeable Prince fan and collector (he's
known to quite a lot of people who he doesn't know - that's what I call well known)
and he said "well, didn't know that. Here's the radio show" (there is exactly ONE
radio show by Prince) and he handed me a three LP set. Later I listened to it,
found L&amp;A (on the 5th side I listened to :-(, it actually is on side 1), and did
not find anything unusual about the mix. Until the very last 5 seconds that are
twisted around a bit. I won't call this remix. And it is not too interesting. All
KaTe colleKTors: leave this piece for all the O{+&gt; collectors in hope that they
will someday find out what really good music is. Just give them a chance.

[the last remarks deserve a BIG smiley.]

Anyhow, for the completists (and for discography maintainers like me):

Prince - New Power Generation Radio Show 3LP set.
No order number at all. The set consists of three LPs with white labels (NPGR and
Side n, 1&lt;=n&lt;=6, printed on it). There's a runout groove message on each side,
'TONE BONE A' to 'TONE BONE F'. The LPs reside in white inner sleeves without
any trace of print on it. These inner sleeves each are to be found in a white
cardboard cover with a whole in the middle. No trace of color on these too.
(Now that's what I call bootlegger's fear.) Finally, the three LPs get company
by a full size b/w sheet of paper with 'PRINCE NEW POWER GENERATION RADIO SHOW 3LP
SET' printed in white on a b/w photo of Prince's head. His right eye is
hidden behind a scarf, the left eye is looking straight into the camera. The back
of this piece of paper is white again. The sound quality is remarkably good for
a bootleg, but remember that this was a radio show in 1989. (WHEN in 1989? Before
or after the middle of October?) Most important track is of course Love and Anger
appearing on Side 1.

Bye,

Uli
