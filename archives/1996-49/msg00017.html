I have put up the new version with the 
background sphere as suggested by Geoff and 
Chris at SGI.  This works.  It slows down the 
animation a bit as expected.  Looks nice though.

<A  HREF="http://fly.hiwaay.net/~cbullard">http://fly.hiwaay.net/~cbullard</A>

I've added a wave file which the start prox 
sensor kicks off.  This .wav is about half a meg 
which is as small as I could make it before 
the sound began to crackle unacceptably. 
It wonka's, then gives a taste of Kate's music.
No more than that.  Too big.  CD-ROM is a 
better media for this kind of thing.

On 14.4, the wav takes around six minutes to load.
A Bryan Dongray midi (Babooshka) starts when the page loads, so let it 
finish and/or select another from the list in 
the html frame.  CosmoPlayer PC lets you 
wander around the world while the wav is 
loading.  It will start unexpectedly because 
the prox sensor to start the animation and 
sound is in the region between the entry 
and start views.  The animation starts, then 
the sound goes off whenever it completes the 
load.  PAGE/DOWN or PAGE/UP switches 
the cameras.

hey all, Happy New Year!  Just got back from Florida where I saw an ad for
the Simpsons which was a parody of a Fruitopia ad . . . very cute. Did
anyone else happen to catch that one?

Last Monday, owner-love-hounds-digest@gryphon.com decided that something had
to be done to stop the encroachment of shadow.

&gt; Much more tricky is to travel via the Lindsey Kemp route:

&gt;   Kate Bush was in TLTC&amp;TC with Lindsey Kemp
&gt;   Lindsey Kemp was in The Wicker Man with Edward Woodward
&gt;   Edward Woodward was in King David with Richard Gere
&gt;   Richard Gere was in Pretty Woman with Julia Roberts
&gt;   Julia Roberts was in Flatliners with Kevin Bacon
ooh...who did Lindsey Kemp play in The Wicker Man?

Allan Anderson -- cerebus@megamed.com  (not starting the 'witch' thread)

"My age, and my time,
 The blood-fire, wine and rhyme
 That fills my dream
 Reminds me of an atom in a bubble, on a wave
 That held its breath for one sweet second,
 Then was popped, and disappeared
 Into Fruitful Futilities,
 Meaningless Meaning."  -- Roy Harper, McGoohan's Blues

   Ah, this is a *fun* bit. Lindsey was the Innkeeper. The Innkeeper
of the Inn on  Summerisle. In the film, you surely remember the
Innkeeper's daughter, right? Well, the *actual* daughter of the actual
Innkeeper of the Inn on Summerisle is Lucy Irvine. Lucy Irvine
wrote "Castaway"...the book which was made into a movie featuring
the song "Be Kind To My Mistakes"!
