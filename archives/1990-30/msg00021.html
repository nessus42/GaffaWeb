&gt;Some do not have the entire collection on CD, some do not have the
&gt;original UK pressings, some have never even heard many of the B-sides, 

The records/CDs in the box set are not original UK pressings, the
1st  four albums have been on the mid-priced Fame record label for at
least 4 years in the UK and these are the albums that are distributed
with the box.  I considered buying the box until I saw the ridiculous
price being charged (70# sterling for LPs). When you consider that the
first four LPs are five pounds each and the last two around eight
pounds, the three others (I understand there are three LPs for the TWW
stuff?) then come in at 11 pounds each which is the going rate for a
single CD!  Admittedly the whole thing is packaged up and includes
some pictures but when you consider that a lot of people will already
have all the studio stuff, the pricing seems rather steep to me. In
fact blatant con is the term I have been using!

I just hope that the record company do what hapeened with a recent
Jethro Tull box set and release the new stuff separately. Or I'll wait
a while for the price to halve like it did  with the Bruce Springsteen
5LP set.

I just object when dedicated fans are taken for a ride and have to buy
duplicate material to keep collections complete, let alone pay over
the odds for it!

Gary Hill, gjh@uk.ac.soton.ecs

&gt;some would like to have the entire set in one nice package.  Calling
&gt;the set crass because it addresses needs that you don't happen to
&gt;share is silly.  

&gt;I've yet to hear reports of anyone being forced to buy the set at 
&gt;gun-point so any "shake-down" is purely a figment of your
&gt;imagination.

&gt;&gt;        Five years later, I am worried.  It has helped me to understand
&gt;&gt; all this to have John Carder Bush's CATHY set.  Jay is 14 years older
&gt;&gt; than Cathy as they conspire together, he to be a photographer, she to
&gt;&gt; be a presence.  One can simply see in these photographs the birth of
&gt;&gt; what beguiles us in the Kate Bush they were inventing, with Paddy as

&gt;Here's where I start to disagree with your conclusions.  I don't
&gt;believe that there was ever a plan of this sort.  Now that you mention
&gt;it I wouldn't be surprised if Kate's early experience as "the
&gt;observed" in Jay's photography helped her to develop the lack of
&gt;inhibition that she displays in her early performances but I don't
&gt;think there's any real evidence that Kate's image was a Bush family
&gt;conspiracy.

&gt;&gt;        Well sister Kate is older now, and it's less and less
&gt;&gt; appropriate for her to be working inside an image she came to with her
&gt;&gt; brothers and Del.  The Kate Bush they saw in her, and she performed
&gt;&gt; for us forever--in "The Kick Inside" and the Hammersmith video from
&gt;&gt; the Tour of Life--had room for three more albums, but it ended with
&gt;&gt; "Hounds of Love."  Dead and drowned, that Kate will forever live again
&gt;&gt; to tell her mother, tell her father, tell her brothers how much she
&gt;&gt; loves them.  

&gt;It seems to me that the image of Kate that you're talking about didn't 
&gt;drown at the end of The Ninth Wave, it was blown up in a bank robbery, 
&gt;killed with a grenade, lost on a secret mission, drown in a straight-
&gt;jacket and finally thrown out of the house in _The Dreaming_.  

&gt;There seem to be different forces at work here.  First of all, at
&gt;some point Kate seems to have discovered all those inhibitions and
&gt;insecurities about her work and herself that she escaped so easily 
&gt;early in her career.  At the same time she moved in the direction 
&gt;of more and more dense music.  

&gt;At some point after _Hounds of Love_ it seems as though the density
&gt;of Kate's work reached critical mass.  At some point while trying to 
&gt;realize her vision of the music that was to become _The Sensual World_
&gt;I have to wonder if maybe it didn't become more of a labor than a
&gt;labor of love.

&gt;None of this means that Kate is finished, she just needs a slightly
&gt;different direction.  The recent HMV/Q interview gives reason to hope
&gt;that the boxed set has provided her with the perspective to find that
&gt;direction.
