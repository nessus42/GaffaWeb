Well, in less than six days some of you lucky Love-Hounds will be
be enjoying the physical presence of one of the greatest artists of
our time.  My envy knows no bounds.  Best wishes and a safe journey to
all of you.   

Some folks have suggested bringing printouts of Love-Hounds so that
others there might see just what we're all about.  Certainly the
essence if LH is lost without the phosphorous glow that is part and
parcel of the whole Love-Hounds experience.  Surely there is a UK
Love-Hound out there with a portable computer that can save LH
messages on disk and display them in a manner more likely to provide
our non-computerized brethren with a deeper understanding.

I was going to flame Jon Drukman into a crispy, steaming husk of a
human being for continuing to fail to see the incredible beauty of
Kate's live performances but then he got all teary eyed and I just
can't do it.  

I still think he must be addled from too much of that industrial dance
thrash funk metal he listens to.  

When Kate sits down at the piano and sings she can pack just as much
into a song as she does with whole studio full of equipment and 100
takes.  Granted, some songs aren't suited to this format, including
virtually everything from _The Dreaming_ on.  

Still, I'd guess that if Kate felt the desire to express herself in 
a live performance it would be in a format that would not require 
all that much material anyway, a half hour appearance on one of the
music channels for instance.  _Never Be Mine_, _This Woman's 
Work_, _Be Kind to My Mistakes_ and _Walk Straight Down the Middle_
would fill that out nicely.  And I still say that if she'd taken a
notion to join Pink Floyd at Knebworth for rendition of _Rocket's
Tail_ she could have set that place on fire.  (Yeah, yeah, what
about the Trio?  Anyone who can cover _The Great Gig in the Sky_ 
could do a reasonable job of "interpreting" their part.)

It was suggested during the griping about the poor quality of the 
recording of _The Sensual World_ that part of the problem might have 
been with the American pressing of the disc.  Sorry but no.  There may 
be some slight improvement in the sound quality of the UK pressing but 
it only serves to further emphasize the imperfections of the recording
itself.  Hiss, rumble and hum, its right there on the master tape and
there's no escaping it.

Fortunately, it does seem that the other UK pressings do benefit from a
slightly better sound.  I seem to detect better high and low end
response.  Or did I dream it.

At the latest record show here in Columbus we found a video of the
Christmas special with a much better picture than the copy we already
have so, of course, we bought it.  I wasn't particularly excited
about the fact that it was labeled as also containing the "Night
Flight" interview because we already have a good copy of that.

We were pleasantly surprised to find that this was in fact raw video
footage of the Night Flight show.  It's amazing to see how one of
these interviews works before they edit out all the interviewer's 
inane questions and replace them with remarks that are more appropriate 
to the answer once they find out what it is.  "What do you like in a 
man?" indeed!  Evidently the idea of knowing something about their 
subject ahead of time hadn't occurred to them.

It is sort of nice to see Kate "behind the scenes" while they fiddle 
with her mike and ask her to read promos.  Her reaction to reading 
"Hi, I'm Kate Bush, watch for my video coming up on Radio 1990" is 
priceless.

Is this something that is widely circulated or is this a rare find?

----

Another item we stumbled across were some postcards.  Most of them
were standard pictures from the album covers but one of them I had
never seen before.  The picture is of Kate wearing a strange looking
silky purple quilted outfit.  The outfit consists of a ankle length
skirt with giant ruffles at the bottom and a cape with giant sleeves 
of the same material tied at the neck.  Is this a promotional photo 
and if so was it associated with anything in particular?
