&gt; [Newbury Comics in Boston taking boxed set orders for ~$130-150]

I am informed that the set costs about $150-160 (#80) in the UK, and that
it is hard to find at that, so I guess I'm going to try Newbury C. as well.
Maybe we can get a bulk discount. 8-]

Slender Fungus asks
&gt; Hey...anyone here a fan of PYLON?
&gt; Is their new album good??????????

I'm a big fan of Pylon (well, actually a sorta average height fan of Pylon),
and I think the new album is good.  By this I mean that I don't think it's
great, nor is it bad -- just good.  It *is* a lot like their old stuff, if
that's any help.  I saw them perform in Boston a while ago, and really 
enjoyed the show -- I'm hoping that the reunion continues at least through
another tour...

Andy Semple says
&gt; P.S A good idea for UK lovehounds is to bring some spare Q/HMV mags,
&gt; so people who can't get it can have a copy at the convention!!

I myself will happily pay a helpful UKLH a reasonable handling fee in
exchange for a spare Q/HMV mag -- seeing as the interview seems to be the
most interesting since _TSW_ came out...

Richard Caldwell says
&gt; It's a shame that CDs are destroying album art.

It's a shame that the record companies are destroying album art;  the CD
format is admittedly much smaller, but there are still a lot of possibilities
for interesting art.  Rykodisc's Bowie reissues are a good example of 
imaginative use of the box, disc surface, foldout inserts, etc.  23
envelope et al at 4AD have done well, (I really like the booklet that comes
with the Pixies _Doolittle_) and one of my favorite music packages period
is the original UK release of New Order's _Lowlife_, which has individual
pictures of the band members sandwiched in a translucent folder:  you couldn't
really do this with an LP cover...

I will admit that Ms. Bush's album art is far more satisfying in the larger
format, but that's why my basement studio is filled with 5 foot high posters
of Herself...

Vickie says
&gt; [suggestions for a booth and/or identifying lovehounds emblem]
I myself was going to wear my VAXstation 3100 M38 on my head (it's in
my face most of the time anyway...) (8-})  Er, well, anyway, I'm gonna be
in London by midafternoon on Friday (I'm staying at the Anne Elizabeth
House near the Gloucester Road tube station) and would be delighted to 
meet up with any lovehound-types who want to record shop, sight-see, eat
dinner, etc.  Failing that, I like the "gaffa's" tape suggestion someone
posted:  just imagine a mob of sticky lovehounds gluing themselves to the
walls and furniture... ;-]
