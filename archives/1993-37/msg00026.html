&gt;OK, next thread: What's your most prized KaTe Kollectible?

Just one? That's too hard. If a flood were coming and we had time to
grab some things, these would be in the first load. 

(We're really the most casual of collectors, so it's amazing that so
much stuff has built up over the years. I can't imagine ever getting
rid of our Kate collection. No way, no how)

**Signed things**

2 photographs (one signed "To Vickie" and one "To Chris") she sent
to us out of the blue, with a note saying "Dear Chris and Vickie, I've
been hearing about you two - Hiy! Love Kate Bush X"

(Plus the envelope they came in, addressed by her) Postmarked July 31, 1984

Signed Japanese HoL LP (though she spelled my name Vickey :-))

Signed Armando Gallo original photo ("To Chris + Vickie, lots of love,
Kate Bush") also signed by Armando Gallo.

(Those we got in New York City, November 1985, when she came here to
promote HoL)

Signed "Suspended In Gaffa" flyer. (A flyer for my radio show) I got that
signed in London, November 1990 after the KaTe KonvenTion. I didn't meet
her, someone (Justin?) took it backstage. I meant to give it to her, but
they brought it back, signed!

Signed photo, same one that Lori has, got at the same time, at BushCon in
Winnipeg. (1984)

**Vinyl**

American "Wuthering Heights" 7" (bought for $1.99 in 1981)
Single File Box Set
This Woman's Work LP Box Set
(and everything else, tons of singles &amp; LPs, I could carry)

**Video**

The Single File (Japanese)
(and, well, everything else I could carry)

**Posters**

All of them! (But especially the "Cathy" poster AM/IED made for us, the
American TKI poster that says "Discover the amazing singing poetess from
England," the original English TD poster, the original American Lionheart
poster, the "Dove earring" poster, the tour posters and the TSW poster.)

plus various &amp; sundry magazines, KBC newsletters, fanzines (I'd definitely
grab the Issue #1 of Homeground!), books and, well...any and everything
humanly possible! I think it would take about 10 trips, just for the Kate
stuff we wouldn't want to lose. *Then* I'd worry about everything else :-)
(Though my original Happy Rhodes cassettes, a few other Happy things, our
Jane Siberry posters, my signed Victoria Williams poster and the painting
she gave me, and a few other things would be in the first load too.)

Goddess help us if a fire ever....yikes, never mind. Then again, stuff is
stuff, and as long as Chris and the cats were ok, nothing else matters.
(Well, that Armando Gallo photo too. If I could only grab *one* thing
besides Chris and the cats, that would be it.)

Vickie (one of Vickie'n'Chris, forever &amp; ever, amen)

ps, Of *course* She IS!
