<PRE>
Yesterday I said I'd look into German charts today. I did and found NOTHING.
And the German chart is a top-100, nevertheless: NOTHING. I don't know whether
Rubberband Girl was in there last week, I missed my chance to look at them,
I would have known last weeks position (if any) if there was a position this
week.

I wonder why. Or rather, I don't wonder at all. The first week of its release
I heard from all people around me that they've seen/got the maxi-CD. I also
did find it, not in the first week but in the second, and only in one shop.
This week I visited four out of five shops in Darmstadt that carry music
(the fifth can be forgotten completely), and I didn't find Rubberband Girl
in any of them. Now Darmstadt isn't as big as Frankfurt and so there's no
WOM or Virgin Megastore or Saturn Hansa or Media Markt, but at least two of
the shops usually have a good selection. One of them at least had RBG two
weeks ago. Now it's completely gone. Not a single disc can be bought in
Darmstadt (unless the fifth shop - nah!). Please tell me someone how anything
could even dream of entering charts with that presence on the market. It's
not as if it's sold out, then it would have appeared in the charts, it's simply
unpresent. Unexisting. Un-there. Like a stone that was created at the bottom
of the sea. Not even thrown into.

Unpleased,

Uli
