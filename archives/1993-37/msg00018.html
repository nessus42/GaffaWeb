<PRE>
Someone had only been able to find the KT sign on the first two
albums.  Unless you have the complete original artwork from Never
For Ever's gatefold edition, you're probably wasting your time looking
for the sign on that album.  As for the sign on The Dreaming, Hounds
of Love/The Ninth Wave, and The Sensual World albums, it helps to have the
artwork from the original 12" LPs, since the signs are relatively harder
to find and are not high-resolution images.  Finally, the KT sign is
hidden on the new _album_ cover (TRS), not (as far as IED is aware) on
the covers of the ETM or RBG singles' covers.  He hopes this is of
some help without being too revealing. 

Stefan complained that Kate's chart position is of no importance.  IED
disagrees.  News that the first single release from the first KT album
in four years has sunk to number 36 in three weeks -- this is bad
news, but news worth knowing.  Not only might her chart positions have
potential influence on her own decision whether to tour or not
(although that would appear to be a settled issue now anyway), it
could also affect her EMI's promotional plans, the media's plans to
cover the album's release, as well as Kate's own plans to make herself
available to the media.  A serious commercial flop in England could
even affect Columbia/Sony's plans for the U.S. release -- for example,
It's already less likely that Sony will choose to release Rubberband
Girl as the album's second single in the U.S. In fact, Sony might soon
review all follow-up plans (assuming anyone in that company is at all 
aware of what they're doing).  Might they opt instead for "And So Is
Love", which (in IED's opinion) fits much more comfortably into U.S.
AOR formats than Rubberband Girl?  Or might they decide not to release
a second single at all, and cut back severely on all their plans for a
big marketing blitz here in November/December? As of the October 2nd
edition of Billboard Magazine, btw, there was still no sign of ETM in
the top 100 US singles chart.
