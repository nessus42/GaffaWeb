Hi all,

    I just got my copy of EtM yesterday in Sydney. Here is where I stick my
neck out... I LIKE it. There, I've said it... Sure it's different, I'm GLAD
it's different. There is still that ineffable KaTiness about it all and as a
song it's very listenable (is that a word?) Anyway, the important thing is, and
here is the crux of the matter, many of my friends who are in no way KaTe fans
have come up to me as I have played it and RBG asked "Who is that!? ... I like
it!!" and isn't that what we all want! You know, spreading the word!!

    Last night when I put it (EtM) one for my other flat mates as we were doing
the washing up Jaquie asked who it was. When I explained it was my new KaTe EtM
CD single. I've kept all my friends up to date with the ongoing hubub on gaffa
with the new releases. She listened for a bit more and said "I don't know what
they're talking about I like it!" I felt like we were in some sort of weird
Coke Ad since we ended up dancing around the kitchen to it whilst washing up.
:-)

    Other KaTe stuff I got whilst in Sydney was the 12" RBG picture disk. Has
anybody else noticed the message on side A written into the free space to the
centre of the album!? If you look carefully you'll see 'WHACK IT ON' :-) I also
got my hands on another KaTe interview album from the HoL period and yet
another HammerSmith boot album. This one is a sort of ultimate when it comes to
bootlegs. It's a 12" 33rpm colour picture disk with NO markings anywhere! Not
even a side A/ side B. It came in a clear plastic cover.

Finally some non-KaTe news : If there are any other Celtic music fans out there
then do yourself a favour and get your hands on an album called 'CANAN NAN
GAIDHEAL' or 'The Language of the Gael' by Catherine-Ann MacPhee. I just found
this CD yseterday and all I can say is WOW!! This one is a must!!

See ya!

PS: She REALLY -IS-!!! :-)
