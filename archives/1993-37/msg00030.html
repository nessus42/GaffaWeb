&gt;thus spake jchokey@leland.Stanford.EDU (James Alexander Chokey):
&gt;&gt; devoted.  So, in addition to Kate Bush, what other contemporary musicians
&gt;&gt; are other gaffa readers really into?

&gt;An easier (and less-bandwidth-consuming) way of accomplishing the same 
&gt;goal is just to hang out here long enough, and see what other artists
&gt;people post about.

Unfortunately, not that many other artists get talked about in gaffa.
Mentioned, yes. Talked about? Not much. A far better source is the
mailing list Ecto, where other artists (especially female artists) are
not only mentioned, but **talked** about, reviewed, raved over. It's a
busy list, because anyone can talk about anything they want to talk
about without fear of being flamed. Besides music, topics range from
movies, books and concerts, to physics, weather and languages, and just
about anything in between. It's a very friendly list and anyone is
welcome (even if you haven't heard Happy's music) so you might give it
a try if the mail load isn't a problem. It's available in loose mail
form or digest form. Jessica's the Ecto Goddess Lady, so write to her
at ecto-request@ns1.rutgers.edu to join.

Coming soon to an Ecto list near you: my transcriptions of interviews
I did with Mary Coughlin, Sheila Chandra and Heidi Berry. Still to
come, interviews with Dead Can Dance's Lisa Gerrard, Jane Siberry,
Wendy MaHarry, Iris DeMent, Eddi Reader and maybe, The Story. Still
trying to line up, Lisa Germano, The Cocteau Twins, and maybe (oh
please oh please) Kate. If I were lucky enough to interview Kate, I'd
post that in gaffa, but I wouldn't feel comfortable posting any of the
others here because they'd take up too much space. They'll definitely
get posted in Ecto though, because I know that no one minds and I won't
get flamed.

I *love* gaffa dearly, so I don't mean to sound derogatory, it's just
that here, there's always an uneasy feeling that a flame war is brewing.
Tempers flare here (and I'm guilty of it too) and there's a feeling
that someone's always waiting to jump on something said. As I said, I'm
guilty of it too, though I'm not as bad as I used to be :-) and I've
tried hard to bite my tongue instead of lash out at certain posts. I
hope that *this* post doesn't start a flame war. I'm just saying that
Ecto is flame-free because subscribers understand that, though it's a
mailing list for Happy Rhodes, it's also a community where people can
talk about anything that's on their minds, get to know each other (beyond
just musical tastes) and be comfortable. It's there for anyone who
might be interested in (and have room &amp; time for) such a thing.
