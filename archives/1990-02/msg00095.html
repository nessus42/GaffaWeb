Vickie here.  This is last Saturday's show, I've just been too lazy
to type it in before now.
                             Yes, USENET, this YOUR show!

As I see women mentioned on the net I jot their names down, if I
know who they are or not. Then I go through my record collection
&amp; pull out those artists mentioned, that I have. If you scan the list
below and see an artist you've mentioned on the net (rec.music.gaffa,
rec.music.misc) or via e-mail correspondence with me, you can be
absoloutely assured that the song was inspired by your mention.

(The one exception is Jevetta Steele. This was a local request)
