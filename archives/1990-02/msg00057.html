 Subject: Complete Kate Bush music list, Part Two

III. NON-LP MUSIC, PART B: MUSIC OTHER THAN EARLY DEMOS.
     (N.B.: Includes, for completeness' sake, all b-sides and non-LP singles.)

  1. The Man With the Child in His Eyes (with spoken introduction).
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The only distinction of this original U.K. single mix is a strange
spoken introduction in which Kate repeats the words "He's here!"
which was added just prior to the song's release as a single in 1978.

  2. Kite.
     ^^^^
     Sung live on the German TV programme "Bio's Bahnhof" (with
host Dr. Alfred Biolek), on February 9, 1978, with the KT Bush Band
supplying live backup.

  3. Wuthering Heights.
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Sung live on the same programme as no. 2, but with
a pre-recorded backing track.

  4. Wuthering Heights.
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Sung live on another German programme, "Scene '78", in the spring of
'78, with a pre-recorded backing track.

  5. Moving.
     ^^^^^^
     Sung live on Japanese TV, June 18, 1978 during the
Seventh Tokyo Song Festival.

  6. The Long and Winding Road.
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Sung live on the Japanese TV programme "Sound in S", June 23, 1978.

 7. She's Leaving Home.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Sung live on the Japanese TV programme "Sound in S", June 23, 1978.

 8. On Stage.
    ^^^^^^^^
     A four-track EP of "live" performances from the Tour of Life, featuring
"Them Heavy People", "Don't Push Your Foot on the Heart Brake",
"L'Amour Looks Something Like You", and a long version of "James and
the Cold Gun". The original performances were taken
from the May 13, 1979 concert at London's Hammersmith Odeon,
and then re-mixed in the studio. These were mixed differently for
the subsequent film soundtrack, so that the performance which is the
common source of EP and film seems quite different in the latter version.

  9. Live at the Hammersmith Odeon.
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The official video release of excerpts from the same May 13, 1979
date, including performances of twelve songs from the Tour of
Life. There are many significant musical changes from the LP
versions, including a long instrumental introduction to
"Kite", and an early version of "Violin" (with non-LP lyrics).

 10.  Kate Bush--In Concert.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     A German/Dutch TV documentary featuring a long interview and live
performances of songs from the Tour of Life that were never officially
released. The concert footage comes from the Hamburg and Mannheim shows.

 11. Wow.
     ^^^
     One of the earliest bootleg Kate Bush albums, this 2-LP set was put
out in 1983 by a New York-based outfit. It consists of a transfer onto vinyl
of the "Hammersmith" video's audio track (see entry no. 9), and another
vinyl transfer of the audio portion of Kate's 1979 U.K. Christmas TV
special (see entry no. 14 below for details about this latter program).
Both recordings have appeared more recently in a made-in-U.K. bootleg 2-LP
set called "Moving", as well; and also as two of the three records
which comprise the recent U.S.-made "Kate Bush Live in Europe '79-'80"
bootleg set. In addition, nine tracks from "Hammersmith" turned up as a
third bootleg LP called "A Bird in the Hand". There are several
additional editions of these tapes to be found.

 12. Live in Paris '79.
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Another bootleg by the New York group,
this record features part of the Paris concert, which was given at
the Theatre des Champs-Elysees on May 6, 1979. The album includes some
interesting versions of LP tracks, including the very different live
arrangement of "Egypt". The identical recording was also included as the
third LP in the more recent "Live in Europe '79-'80" bootleg set mentioned
in entry no. 11 above. This first edition is identified as being
a production of the non-existent "Fan Club of Taiwan". The same
recording has also appeared as a bootleg audio-cassette.

 13. Dreamtime, Bristol Concert; etc.
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Many titles for various bootleg recordings of a number of dates
from the Tour of Life concert series. Among these are the Bristol,
London Palladium and Manchester dates. They feature not only songs, but
a chant, readings by John Carder Bush, and incidental bits of music,
all of which were heard while Kate changed costumes in between songs
during the concert. Specifically, there are: a heartbeat passage preceding
"Room For the Life"; an ethnic chant performed by the band in unison;
two synthesizer introductions to songs; three brief readings by
John--one known as "Two in One Coffin" (preceding "The Kick Inside"),
the others passages of unidentified prose (perhaps by John); an
arrangement of Satie's 1st "Gymnopedie", which is used to frame
"Symphony in Blue", and a short jam session by the KT Bush Band. Also of
note is the live version of "Egypt", which sounds very different from the
LP version.

14. Kate.
    ^^^^
     This was a forty-five minute TV special which aired in England on
December 28, 1979; sometimes called the "Christmas Special". In
addition to a couple of lip-synchs of LP tracks and one
or two new vocal performances of old songs, several new and
unique bits of music appeared on this show. They include a brief
introduction, an arrangement of part of Satie's "First Gymnopedie"
(as an introduction to "Symphony in Blue"); an early version of "December
Will Be Magic Again"; a choral introduction for Peter Gabriel (Kate's
guest on the show--he sings "Here Comes the Flood"), sometimes referrred
to as "Peter, the Angel Gabriel"; a brief bit of blues piano; and a
duet with Peter of Roy Harper's song, "Another Day".

15. Another Day.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^
     Approximately one year after taping the "Kate" special, Kate and
Peter Gabriel returned to the studio to re-record this song. It was never
released, however, and has never been heard.

16. Ibizza. &lt;sic--possibly Ibizza, after the Spanish island.&gt;
    ^^^^^^                 ^^^^^^
     A song co-written by Kate and Gabriel and originally intended as
the b-side for the single of "Another Day". They were "not satisfied
with the results", however, and the project was shelved. Consequently,
no-one has ever heard this track.

17. Let It Be.
    ^^^^^^^^^
     A live performance of the Beatles song, sung by
Steve Harley, Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush during a modified Tour of Life show,
staged at London's Hammersmith Odeon on May 12, 1979 for the benefit of the
surviving relatives of Bill Duffield, Kate's lighting director for the Tour,
who had died in an accident at the very beginning of the tour.
An excerpt from this performance appears in a very
limited edition red plastic flexi-disc, made officially by the
Kate Bush Club for the Japanese branch of the Club. In addition to
the excerpt from the song, the flexi-disc includes brief spoken messages
from John Carder Bush and Kate. A longer excerpt of the same song
(but without the spoken messages) has recently appeared on a 1987 2-LP
bootleg set called "Passing Through Air"-- the only unusual material
to be found on that bootleg album, which otherwise consists primarily
of more than usually illegal, poor-quality re-pressings of official EMI
b-sides and re-mixes. In addition to songs from The Tour of Life,
this concert featured a version of "Them Heavy People" with verses sung
by Harley and Gabriel; "The Woman With the Child in Her Eyes" sung by
Harley and Gabriel; Gabriel's "I Don't Remember" sung as a duet by
Gabriel and Kate; and Harley's "Come Up and See Me", sung by Harley,
with Kate and Gabriel on backing vocals. A poor recording of a few
excerpts from the Duffy concert surfaced ca. 1987 as a bootleg live
album called "If You Could See Me Fly", an album which also included
excerpts from two early demo versions of "Babooshka".

18. Blow Away.
    ^^^^^^^^^
     A live performance given at the London Symphony
Orchestra's 75th anniversary concert, November 18, 1979.
As far as I know, no recording of this performance has ever surfaced
in any form.

19. Kashka From Baghdad.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     A live solo performance given on a British TV programme called
"Ask Aspel" on September 5, 1978.

20. The Wedding List.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     A live performance given during the Prince's
Trust Gala Concert on July 21, 1982. Kate is backed by Phil
Collins on drums, Gary Brooker on keyboards, Pete Townsend and Midge Ure
on guitars and backing vocals, and Mick Karn on bass. This was released
on a video-cassette of excerpts from the Gala Concert.

21. Breathing (single mix).
    ^^^^^^^^^
    Almost unnoticeable changes from the LP mix.

22. The Empty Bullring.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The b-side of the "Breathing" single.

23. Ran Tan Waltz.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The b-side of the "Babooshka" single.

24. Army Dreamers (single mix).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Unlike the LP mix, this version does not fade out.

25. Them Heavy People.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     A cover version recorded by EMI artist Ray Shell on February 21,
1981, to which Kate contributed backing vocals.

26. December Will Be Magic Again.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The 1981 Christmas single, this song was actually written
much earlier, and was performed both on the "Kate" programme (see
entry no. 14), and on Abba's "Winter Snowtime Special" on December
21, 1979 (in a third arrangement which featured bongo drums).

27. Warm and Soothing.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The b-side of the "December Will Be Magic Again" single.

28. Sing, Children, Sing.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     A benefit single by Leslie Duncan, with
Kate (virtually indistinguishable) singing in the all-star
back-up chorus, released November 30, 1979.

29. You (The Game, Part III).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     A duet with Roy Harper of his song, on his album "The Unknown
Soldier", recorded in February, 1980. A rumour persists that Kate and
Harper recorded an entire album's worth of duets during these sessions,
and that the tapes may someday become available on the black market.

30. Flowers.
    ^^^^^^^
     A duet with Zaine Griff of his song, on his 1982 LP "Figures",
recorded in June, 1982. This song was a tribute to the dancer/mime/
choreographer Lindsay Kemp, with whom Kate and Zaine had studied
together for a time in 1976. Kate sang on this one track only.
for a time in 1976.

31.  No Self Control and Games Without Frontiers.
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Two tracks from Peter Gabriel's third solo album, for which
kate recorded backing vocals in January, 1980.

32. The Magician (theme from the film The Magician of Lublin).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     A song from the film starring Alan Arkin, it was recorded by Kate
in February, 1979, and featured music by Maurice Jarre and lyrics by
Paul Webster. No soundtrack was ever commercially released; consequently,
the song is only known from the nearly unlistenable film print itself
(dialogue obscures most of Kate's vocal).

33. Sat In Your Lap (rhythm track only).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     This track, isolated from the complete mix, was heard briefly on a
British TV documentary called "Looking Good, Feeling Fit," which aired
August 6, 1981.

34. Sat In Your Lap (single mix).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Different in sound (especially the rhythm and relative prominence
of the lead vocal track) from the LP version. This mix was actually
begun as far back as September, 1980.

35. Lord of the Reedy River.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The b-side of the "Sat In Your Lap" single. The original song
is by Donovan, who, the rumour goes, contributes backing vocals
(though if so, unidentifiably).

36. Dreamtime.
    ^^^^^^^^^
     The b-side of the single, "The Dreaming". An instrumental version
of "The Dreaming", "Dreamtime" is very similar to the LP track except
for a longer, different ending and the absence of lead vocal tracks.

37. Ne T'enfuis pas.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Originally the b-side of the single release of "There Goes a
Tenner". The same recording was later remixed (the rhythm sound
brightened and the lead vocal moved farther up in the mix) for French
and Canadian release as an a-side.

38. Un Baiser d'enfant.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The b-side of the remixed "Ne T'enfuis pas", this is a French-
language version of the track "The Infant Kiss", the original of which
is found on the album, "Never For Ever".

39. Running Up That Hill (instrumental).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Identical to the LP version, except for the missing lead vocal
track. Featured on the twelve-inch single.

40. Running Up That Hill (extended remix).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     An extended remix of the original recording, featured on the
twelve-inch single.

41. Cloudbusting (The Orgonon Mix).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
     An extended remix of the original recording, featured on the
twelve-inch single.

42. Cloudbusting (the video soundtrack).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
     An extended version of the original recording, with a brief insert
of new music.

43. Hounds of Love (Alternative Hounds mix).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     An extended remix of the original recording, with completely
different vocals.

44. The Big Sky (Special Single mix).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^
     A seven-inch version of the original recording, with a slight
remix and a different opening.

45. The Big Sky (The Meteorological Mix).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^
     An extended remix of the original recording, featured on the
twelve-inch single.

46. Under the Ivy.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The b-side of the "Running Up That Hill" single.

47. Burning Bridge.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The b-side of the seven-inch "Cloudbusting" single, and the first
b-side of the twelve-inch.

48. My Lagan Love.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The second b-side of the "Cloudbusting" twelve-inch, this
track is an a cappella recording of the traditional Irish folk-song.

49. The Handsome Cabin Boy.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The b-side of the "Hounds of Love" single, this track is a
Fairlight-backed recording of another traditional Irish folk-song.

50. Not This Time.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The b-side of the single, "The Big Sky".

51. Experiment IV (extended remix).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Featured on the twelve-inch single.

52. Experiment IV (video soundtrack mix).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     This version includes a brief insert from the twelve-inch extended
mix.

53. Breathing and Do Bears Sh... in the Woods?
    ^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Both live, from the album of the April 4/6, 1986 Comic Relief shows,
called "Utterly, Utterly Live". Kate accompanies herself on electric
piano for "Breathing", and sings the comic song (not of her composing)
"Do Bears Sh... in the Woods?" with British comic actor Rowan Atkinson.
The video version of these concerts features what appears to be a
different night's performance of the same two songs. (The programme
was performed a total of three times.)

54. Brazil.
    ^^^^^^
     A cover of the old popular song, not included in the 1985
Terry Gilliam film "Brazil", but promised for inclusion in the
soundtrack LP--which, however, will probably never be officially
released. A bootleg pressing of Kate's recording for the album
may become available eventually, however.

55. Be Kind to My Mistakes (soundtrack album version).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Theme song which Kate wrote and recorded for the 1987 Nicholas Roeg
film, "Castaway". This version appeared on the soundtrack album, and
is the original, full-length mix. An abridged version of the same
recording was heard during the title-sequence of the film itself.
See entry number 69 for further information about this song.

56. This Woman's Work.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Theme song for the 1987 John Hughes film "She's Having a Baby",
released in February 1988. (For some months prior to its release this
song was sometimes referred to by fans as "Make It Go Away", because
of the prominence of that phrase in the song.) Two later mixes of this
song exist. See entries nos. 70 and 71.

57. Don't Give Up.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     A duet with Peter Gabriel of a song from his album "So".

58. The Seer.
    ^^^^^^^^
     A track from Big Country's 1986 album of the same name.
Kate sings backing vocals.

59. The King is Dead.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     A track from Go West's 1987 album "Dancing on the Couch". Kate
sings backing vocals. She probably agreed to contribute to this track
because of her friendship with the late guitarist Alan Murphy, who was
an unofficial member of Go West at the time.

60. Let It Be.
    ^^^^^^^^^
     7" and 12" single by Ferry Aid for the survivors and families
of the 1987 Zeebrugge ferry disaster. Kate sang three lines of the song
during a separate studio session unrelated to the rest of the recording.

61. Running Up That Hill and Let It Be (both live).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^
     Songs performed by Kate in concert on behalf of
Amnesty International's "The Secret Policeman's Third Ball"
shows. The second of the two Amnesty concert performances of
"Running Up That Hill" is included on the official soundtrack album, and
"Let It Be" (backed with a poor-quality recording of the first of
the two Amnesty performances of "Running Up That Hill") is available
as a bootleg seven-inch single.

62. Wuthering Heights (New Vocal).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Actually an LP track, since it is featured on Kate's compilation
LP, "The Whole Story".

63. Under the Ivy (live).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     A live performance of the song recorded at Abbey Road Studios
for the 100th edition of the Tyne Tees TV programme "The Tube".

64. Sister and Brother.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Duet with Midge Ure of his song, from his album "Answers to
Nothing", released in September 1988.

65. Spirit of the Forest.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Kate sings one line in a guest appearance for the "all-star"
recording of a song (not written by Kate) about the dwindling
rain forests of South America. This song was recorded for and
broadcast during a programme about ecological issues called "Our
Common Future" in 1989. As with the Zeebrugge "Let It Be" charity record
(see entry 60), Kate did not participate in the group chorus sessions,
but came in at a different time to sing her one line alone.

66. Rocket Man.
    ^^^^^^^^^^
     A plan to record a cover version of Elton John's song, as part
of a compilation of recordings by various artists in a tribute to
John and his lyricist Bernie Taupin, has been scratched and re-scheduled
more than once now. As of January 1990 is has been de-activated,
and there is no sign that the song will ever be released.

67. Bulgarian folksong.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     An excerpt from an unidentified Bulgarian folksong, heard
briefly during a segment of an episode from the British music series,
"Rhythms of the World". Kate sings the vocal drone accompaniment to
Yanka Rupkhina's solo.

68. Rocket's Tail (excerpt of an early mix).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     This extract of an early, "rough" version of "Rocket's Tail"
is found in a segment from the British music series, "Rhythms of
the World" (see number 67). During this segment Kate is seen at a
mixing desk with Kevin Killen (?), supervising the vocal contributions
of the Trio Bulgarka.

69. Be Kind to My Mistakes (remix).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     A supplementary track on the CD-single of "This Woman's Work",
this version of the song Kate wrote for Nicholas Roeg's film "Castaway"
in 1987 is drastically abridged and re-mixed.

70. This Woman's Work (LP mix).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     This version of the song which Kate wrote for the John Hughes film
"She's Having a Baby" is a very slight remix of the original. It was
remixed by Kevin Killen, probably in order to fit the timbre of the rest
of the album, "The Sensual World".

71. This Woman's Work (Special Single Mix).
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     This version of the song which Kate wrote for the John Hughes film
"She's Having a Baby" features a sharper, more prominent bass line in
the second half and a boosted lead vocal line.

72. I'm Still Waiting.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     The b-side from the "This Woman's Work" single.
