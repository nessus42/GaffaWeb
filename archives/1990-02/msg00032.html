&gt;     However, IED must warn everyone not to get their hopes up too
&gt;high that all three of the new videos will be included. It's very
&gt;possible, of course, but you never know with these things. IED would
&gt;really doubt that the other three (of the six Arthur mentions) will
&gt;be new videos for _TSW_. More likely they are previously released
&gt;videos, or perhaps three of the five videos that were left off
&gt;_TWS_ and thus have never been released in the U.S. in any form.

I doubt very much if any of the videos from _The Whole Story_ will
be on this new video cassette, because Columbia doesn't have the
rights to them, as far as I know.   Capitol/EMI has the rights, and
they'd be foolish to sell them now -- they benefit from whatever 
publicity Columbia creates, and they don't have to pay for it!

I guess it's possible that some of the five videos that were left off
_TWS_ might be on this, since they were never released here, so it's
unclear who has the American rights to them.

Wait -- I just thought of a way that some videos from _TWS_ might be on
the new video cassette.  _The Whole Story_ was released in America
under the Sony label.  (I'm not sure how this came about.)  Sony
now owns Columbia.  So if Sony actually had the rights to the videos
on _TWS_, and didn't license the rights from Capitol/EMI specifically
for that video cassette, then it's possible.  Or perhaps Sony could
license them again from Capitol/EMI.  I just don't know.  Frankly,
I doubt it.
