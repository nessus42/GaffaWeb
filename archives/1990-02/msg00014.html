 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: Mailbag

   First, unless the laser-disks of _Hammersmith_ and _TWS_ are
imminent _domestic_ releases, your information about pricing ($20-25)
is incorrect. As far as IED is aware the only laser-disks of these
(or any) Kate videos are Japanese imports, and if you are able to get
those in for $20, please give IED the phone number of your dealer
_immediately_! The usual price is $60 to $120 per disk.

 &gt; Can anyone fill me in on who he is and what he's done over the years?  I
 &gt; picked up a copy of his album 'Figures' (WG, 1982) when I noticed that
 &gt; Kate was credited as a musician on the back cover, and sure enough, her
 &gt; background vox are present all through the album.  I'm not sure if she
 &gt; plays an actual instrument, because who plays what (and indeed, what is
 &gt; played at all) isn't listed on the album.

     _Figures_ was Griff's second album. He had an earlier one which
had a close-up of him on the cover with rainbow-coloured hair. It
featured Tony Visconti in the line-up and sounded very Bowie-esque.
     Kate does _not_ sing back-up vocals throughout the album of
_Figures_. Kate sings vocals on only _one_ track, _Flowers_. Kate
has confirmed this herself. The female vocals on the rest of the
album are _not_ Kate. Kate herself only came in as a guest of Zaine's
and sang on _Flowers_ because she had been a classmate of Zaine's at
Lindsay Kemp's dance/mime/movement school in the '70s, and Kate
loved the song.
