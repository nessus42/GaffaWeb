I'm listening to _Still Life_ by Beautiful Pea Green Boat.  First the
bad news:  It's not as good as Kate.  The group has a dumb name.  Now
the good news:  It's a great album.  I have to add myself to the list
of people who reccomend this one.  I got it, trusting other other
reviews of it here, and I'm glad I did.

It sounds most like Cocteau Twins, Innocence Mission, Heavenly Bodies,
and so forth.  Unlike the Coctuea Twins, the lyrics are in Enlish
rather than Fraserish.  The tracks are quite varied, though all within
the same genre.  Some have fairly strong percussion and move quickly,
while others are slower and more mellow.  Some are instrumental while
others have vocals.  I haven't listened to the lyrics, but they're
clearly comprehensible.  The most similar vocalist I can think of is
Sarah McLachlan.  It's on C'est La Morte Records.

By the way, I've had _Celestial_ by Heavenly Bodies for about a year
now.  It's very good too.  I may have written a review of it back
then, and if so I would have said it was also similar to Cocteau Twins.
I got it, also without hearing it first, solely on the basis of the
Cocteau Twins style cover and the reasonable (domestic) price.  It's
not as scary risking $12 on an unknown album as it is to risk $20!  I
liked it, and I wondered why I never heard about it in Love-Hounds
again until this month.  But I guess C'est La Mort is a rather obscure
label.  I'll have to try more of their stuff.

I should be mapped.  If mail bounces, try "nwnexus!sensual!steve" instead.
