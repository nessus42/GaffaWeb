Article from the Swedish "serious" magazine MusikDramatik's (Musical
drama) fourth issue 1989. It is written by Ola Stensson. The
translation is mine, with help from Ms. Carina Skytt.

I hope you'll be able to follow the translation; I think I've
eliminated most of the Swedish-isms...

_Of_course_ I've used _British_ spelling...

Preamble: "Much can be included in the conception of musical drama --
eg rock videos. Might this be an art form belonging to the future? Ola
Stensson have studied one rock artist with artistic ambitions -- Kate
Bush."

The article: "There is one enormously vital art form that have been
ignored in Swedish arts pages during the eighties -- the rock video.
It is possible that this means of expression already has changed our
perception, our view of a dramatic course of events, our sense of
rhythm, and also our view of man.
  The rock video is nothing new -- it's nearly as old as the form of
music itself. The interesting thing is that while this music has
stepped back after the reshaping years of 1966-1971, rock, in it's
capacity of visual medium, has developed and is at the moment most
creative, vital, and often experimental. The situation today is really
paradoxal. Sometimes it can almost be as if Harry Kupfer should
produce Laurel &amp; Hardy film.
  There are exeptions where music, lyrics, and visuals are a
synthesis, and where we are at the Complete Work of Art. An example of
an artist with ambitions as well as means of creating something like
this is Kate Bush. It's not a question of comparing her to Wagner,
Alban Berg, Karl-Birger Blomdahl, or someone else with their ambition.
But, she is an example of what could be done and what always can be
done. Most of the innovation remains.


WUTHERING HEIGHTS

Kate Bush is English, and was born in 1958, made a hit in 1978 with
"Wuthering Heights", a song based on Emily Bronte's novel. She has
since released six albums. The music is sometimes superficially very
difficult to access, with complicated arrangements and dared shifts in
rhythm, especially on the LP "The Dreaming" form 1982. This dosen't
hinder a strong influence from folk-music, not the least the Irish,
like in "Hounds of Love" (1985) or the Bulgarian as in "The Sensual
World" (1989).
  If you go through Kate Bush's videos from the beginning you find a
development that pretty well correspond to the one her music has
undergone. Here follow some examples.
	In the beginning it was not a matter of illustrating lyrics
and music. It was more a matter of pure promotion ((emphasized in the
original --Andreas)). If one, as an example, choses videos from Kate's
first album one finds her videos decorative, elegant, but dramatically
highly stylized. There are exeptions, though, like "Hammer Horror"
from the second LP "Lionheart". The lyrics are about the depression
that always seems to lurk in the singer's soul, and hinders the I she
shows among the people. Kate performs with an aura of innocence, she
wears brightly coloured flowers, but she is wearing black clothes and
is constantly followed by another black clothed figure that imitates
her movements. After a while she throws the flower decorated hat away
and the black shadow gets more power over her. They enter an erotic
dance, which ends with the black clothed masqued shape strangling its
victim.
  This is perhaps the first Kate Bush video where the producer's
ambitions were beyond creating a mere promotion. Kate's ideas are now
developing, and the result is shown in full by the 1982's "The
Dreaming", where an enormous amount of work has been concentrated on
her visual language. The result is very gifted and most peculiar.
Take, for example, "Breathing". Kate is here enclosed in a transparent
bubble, which strongly reminds of a womb. She tries to break out of
this bubble, but succeeds only in moving it. She imitates the embryo's
movements in the amniotic fluid "I've been out before. But this time
it's much safer in.". Suddenly the bubble starts rotating and rolls
without control. It bursts, and a birth takes place in strong lights
like from an atomic explosion. In the next sequence one sees Kate wade
out of a river (the water returns as a symbol) together with other
survivors -- breathing ((emphasized in the original --Andreas)) -- and
the A-bomb mushroom shrinks. So, life is appearently possible, even
for the one who manage to break free from herself.
  A very sophisticated video, not only technically, is "Sat In Your
Lap". The lyric is philosophical and deal with the impossiblitity
about knowledge. Kate roller-skates, in a cone-formed idiot hat,
together with similiarly clothed people. In come fools and heathens in
brutal bull masks. The urges and the joking is reality, we don't have
any other knowledge. Kate is now clad in "the White Ballet's"
attribute, and dances on the clean parquet, as the Cultural Human
surrounded by reality.


STONEHENGE LANDSCAPE

"The Dreaming" is one of her most famous videos, and is taking place
in a dreamt Stonehenge landscape, obviously located on another planet.
Kate falls out of the sky in a space suit. But everything from her
original civilization seems to have been forgotten, since she starts
working on a rock with a wedge and looks watchfully around like a
human -- a prehistoric human -- surrounded by a thousand dangers. A
laser beam cuts through the landscape, and she caresses it with her
hands. Thus she and the "primitive" aboriginies conjure
 on the planet a thunderstorm, which buries them in sand. But one of
the beings, previously mute, can suddenly speak. So, the human doesn't
change. The primitive can develop, and the civilized can go back, but
a change is in fact not possible.
  "Suspended In Gaffa" has a abandoned stable as the scene. "Can't
have it all" is a maxim in the lyric, which is illustrated by Kate
building a bird out of nothing -- out of the thin air -- which then
flies. In the end the bird is captured, but it's not a usual bird, not
of flesh and blood, but consisting of one feather which is caught by
the wind. "I'm much more of that girl in the mirror between you and
me" -- so it's her own view of herself that hinders her real contact
with other people. In the end a mother figure appears in this stable.
This mother is real and doesn't disappear when Kate hugs her.
  These songs about no contact and ignorance about the reality, were
in some sense exchanged by sturdiness in her next album, "Hounds of
Love". The perhaps most famous video from this production is about "a
deal with god" and is called "Running Up That Hill". Is it possible to
make a deal with God -- a deal implying that the Man and the Woman in
a relationship change places, change identities? The answer is of
course no, and is first illustrated by an intense dance between Kate
and a man. Then she leaves on her own, but wherever she walks she is
met by her opposite -- people with her beloved's mask. She gets
desperate and soon meets people wearing masks identical with her own.
Humans may change identity, they might even look like her, but she
herself cannot change with anyone.


HOUNDS OF LOVE

In the video for the song "Hounds of Love" she works as a guide in a
factory, where she finds a man who draws her to him. They flee into
the forest, but the "Hounds of Love" hunts them. They come to a house
in the woods, where a merry party is going on. Kate chains herself to
the man, they dance out, but it's not a question of love, the "Hounds
of Love" get tired and give up hunting them. She's afraid of love as a
frightful possibility, and attach herself to a man only to be able to
renounce.
  A video with a lot more hopeful tone in it is illustrated by
"Cloudbusting", based on a novel by Peter Reich which deals with the
child and the father -- the father has built a rain-making machine.
Everything is seen through the eyes of the child. The father (played
by Donald Sutherland) is caught by brutal police men in civilian
clothes. The child (Kate) sees him being taken away, but runs to the
machine and makes it start raining. She rejoices -- the machine is
working -- and the peoples creative power is stronger than the
oppression. The sky opens and the water pours down over Cornwall.
  Thus can Kate Bush's world look -- anyhow in the video version, even
if she sometimes herself expresses a fear that it might seem too
narcissistic. It would carry to far to deal with all the details
around colouration, choreography, and cutting rhythm. But the rock
video surely opens new perspectives, and also a multitude of
interpretation possibilities, at least when it's in the hands of very
gifted people. And we have seen far from the end yet.
  The conclusion is: Don't be afraid of the rock culture, and,
particularly, don't be afraid of the Bush lass. She has much to give
us, regardless to which generation we belong. And the rock video, as
has been said, is a very vital part of musical drama which we now must
not look down on. Don't content yourselves with reading about this:
See it and form your own opinion!"
