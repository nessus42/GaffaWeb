OK, folks, here's the news:

1)  From _Billboard_, Jan. 13:

The album moved up one more position, from #45 to #44, but it lost its
bullet, so it probably will not go up any more.

"Love And Anger" remains at #2 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.

The video for L&amp;A is still in the Buzz Bin at MTV, and is Current in
The Record Guide (whatever that is).

VH-1 has renamed its rotation labels.  Instead of Heavy and Medium, we
now have Five Star Video and Artist Development.  There doesn't actually
seem to be any changes;  everything that was Heavy last week is now
Five Star Video, and everything that was Medium last week is now Artist
Development.  The latter includes L&amp;A.

Melinda Newman's "The Eye" column talks about this change.  In it, she
says, "Artists such as Kate Bush and Peter Himmelman in the artist
development category will have their clips played three times a day."
This is the first time I've heard a specific number!

2) _Cash Box_ has its year end special issue, and several staff members
have _TSW_ on their top ten lists.

3)  I don't remember that anyone posted the review of the album that
appeared in the _Chicago Tribune_ of Oct. 26.  If someone has, please
accept my apologies.  It's pretty short.

Kate Bush  The Sensual World (Columbia) *** [out of 4]

     If Bush sounds a tad more accessible these days, it's probably
because pop radio has finally caught up with her (thanks to such like-minded
artists as Peter Gabriel and Brian Eno).  Though Bush has a sweet
soprano, she's more of a seductress than a singer, even when the topic
isn't love or romance.  In the grand tradition of Sinatra, Elvis and Al
Green, she knows she doesn't have to shout to make her point.  Just listen
to the way she whispers and breathes into the microphone on the record's
title cut, as if she and the listener were the only people left in the 
world.  Add to that an exotic mix of instruments -- uillean pipes,
bouzouki, David Gilmour's guitar, the surreal harmonies of the Trio
Bulgarka, airy layers of keyboards --and you have a record that more 
than delivers on the promise of its title.
				      -- Greg Kot

4)  Mondays and Fridays the California Music Channel (a daily hour-long
video music show) is
all request.  The video for L&amp;A was requested and played on each
of the last two Mondays.


That's it for now, folks.
