Vickie here. (Thanks Valerie! Dingdong :-)

Boris asks:

&gt; When was the last time you heard "murderess"?

    Is it the lonliness of night
    That makes you reach out and bite
    The unawakened flesh
    You lady in distress
 
    You poor poor suffering murderess

                  "Black Widow" by Michelle Shocked.

Anybody know what she's up to?

J. Fingerle says:

&gt; I always assumed "In Excelsis Dio", figuring IED and U2 (see _Gloria_)
&gt; meant Ronnie James Dio. 

Wow, time to dig out my Elf albums. I went through that phase, and Elf was
a staple diet. Especially the album with the "demented elf" on the cover.

Julian Lawton says:

&gt; Of all the acts on 4AD (probably 50 odd throughout the 80s) only 6 or 7 
&gt; spring to mind as typically 4AD - Cocteaus, This Mortal Coil, His Name Is
&gt; Alive, Dif Juz, Dead Can Dance, Le Mystere Des Voix Bulgares, Richenel...
                                                                ^^^^^^^^
Julian, do you (or anyone else) know anything about this artist?
A friend of mine sent me a song by him. She described him as
"a male Lisa Gerrard with a bit of Klaus Nomi thrown in" and that's 
pretty close. She only has that one song and wants to hear more. So do I.

Neil Calton says:

&gt; The Cockney Rejects were (maybe still are) a punk band who appeared
&gt; around the time of the Pistols, Clash, Damned etc. in the UK. They
&gt; had a few minor hits.

Are you thinking of The Cockney Rebels? Some of whom were on _The Kick
Inside_?

&gt; as Caetano is Brazillian and sings in Portuguese. I like him a lot though

Speaking of Portugese-language artists, does anyone know of a woman named
Fernanda Maria? I have one dubbed (from a friend) album called _Fados_
and it's great! She has an amazing voice and sings with power and emotion.

I've just loved all the talk about 4AD (and ish) artists, Laurie Anderson,
Kirsty MacColl etc. Thanks everyone.
