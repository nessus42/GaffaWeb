Vickie here.  Long post here too, but full of lots of music.

Greg Blouch talks spooky music:

&gt; Trick or treat!  Get away from me you sponging, freeloading, scrubbers!
&gt; Diamanda Galas will *definitely* be blasting out of strategically placed
&gt; speakers on Halloween night.  Hopefully the little tykes won't be 
&gt; escorted by easily offended parents.  Any suggestions for other
&gt; halloween music?  I can eat the candy myself if I can scare off (or
&gt; at least discourage) kids from coming to my door.

I love doing Halloween radio shows! This will be the 4th year that I've
done a "Witchy Women &amp; Weird Warblings" show. Here's my playlist for 2
years ago, when I was allowed 3 hours for the show. Not all the songs
will seem particularly witchy or weird by their titles, if you don't
know the song, but they are, really. Well, maybe not Dead Can Dance. It 
didn't matter what I played by them, I just _had_ to play them for their
name. :-)

"Music Mecanique" and "Fear of Spiders" are instrumental jazz pieces that
are full of creaking doors and spooky sounds. Diamanda Galas _always_ 
sounds creepy, so it wouldn't matter what I played. "Metamorfosi" is on 
John Zorn's album _The Big Gundown_ and, is one of my favorite things
Diamanda has done. "Leroy" by Fibonaccis is based on the classic creepy 
killer kid movie _The Bad Seed_ and has lines from the film ("I hit him 
with my SHOE!"), it's great fun! The Danielle Dax song was on a 12" 
that I had just picked up and I wanted an excuse to play it without breaking
the show's theme. Luckily it turned out the song sounded creepy anyway. :-)

Kate's "Carmilla" (remember your post Larry DeLuca? :-) is based on the
vampire story, but my mind's a blank at the moment as to who wrote it.
Happy's "I'm Going Back" has monsters, cats, attic antiques, and bats in it.
Very creepy and wonderful. Toyah's "Angel &amp; Me" is a ghosty tale and "Trust
In Me" just sounds creepy too. Most everything else is self-explanatory. 

Styles and eras run the gamut, from Diamanda to Toyah to Buffy St. Marie
to Valaida Snow, a singer/songwriter/trumpet player (!) from the 30s. At
the height of her career she was incarcerated in a German-occupied Dutch 
prison camp (no one knows why) and when she was released tried to revive
her career. She never was able to and died in poverty. "You Bring Out The 
Savage In Me" is an upbeat swing number that's lots of fun.

This was a such a *fun* show to put together! Definitely one of my all-time
favorite SIGs. I love every song. All these songs are female vocalists
and/or musicians too and I could have gone on and on. I still had a bunch
more to play that I didn't get to. I could have done _entire_ shows of 
Diamanda Galas, Kate, and Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees, maybe Happy too. I
didn't even really look that hard to find these other songs I did play. 
They're so much fun to find too. Yeah, there's lots of Halloween-perfect
songs out there.

For long-timers who might be confused...we weren't yet on the net 
when this show aired but I used to give Andy/IED my playlists and he
would type them in and post them. This is one he did for me. We got on
the net about a month later, thanks to Joe Turner (yay! thanks!) who
introduced us to the wonders of modern Public Access Unix sites.

Suspended In Gaffa (A celebration of the female voice)
currently airs on:

Kansas City  KKFI 90.1fm Sat. 10:00pm-11:00am
Chicago      WZRD 88.3fm Wed. 7:00pm-8:00pm

Soon (really Kiri) to air in WTSC in Potsdam, NY
