&gt;Well. I just saw Laurie Anderson a few days ago.  She is currently on her
&gt;"Voices from the Beyond" tour.  The show only contains 3 or 4 "songs".  The
&gt;rest of the two hour show is a stand-up social commentary , focusing on First
&gt;Amendment rights and equal rights.

Great! What 3 or 4 songs does she include? Anything new? Old? In between?
I sure wish she'd have more.

&gt;  She even included quotes from "Two Live 
&gt;Crew" and comments on the Thomas-Hill case.  In fact, she requested a TV 
&gt;backstage in order to watch the trial.

I think KT is better for quoting Joyce.
I wonder who she sided with? I am as eager to hear more about the
"case" as I am eager to hear about Iraq. Not very eager.

&gt;
&gt;Unfortunatety, the material from this tour would probably just not go over
&gt;well as an album.

Speaking of which. Do you happen to know when her next is coming out?

Does she do anything interesting in this latest tour? Big screens with
spinning objects in the back? Her violin? Glowing mouth? Sharky?

BTW, I am wondering if in the HotB video, that old guy in it, who seems
to be sharky, is Bouroughs (sp?), the author in which she got the
quote "Language is a virus from outer space" from.

Speaking about her concerts, I saw her Strange Angles concert, and
thought it was incredibly good. Unfortunatly I got there late and got
usher up to the standing room area, until a break, where I was then
seated. I think she sang a song about a cowboy; I don't have it on
any of my albums, is it on the America Live CD set? Also, I saw her
a few months later at an AIDS concert benifit, with Bobby, H. Hancock,
and others. It was in the outdoor greek theatre here at Cal, and
unfortunately it rained. Philip Glass refused to go on stage,
and tarp structures were errected for others including the
Kronos Quartet. Laurie wasn't to perform, but because of the
technical difficulty she kep us entertained. (monologue about
helms, White Lily, playing her tie/keyboard, other diddy's,
mingling with the crowd with Bobby taggin along). Bobby took off
his shirt and kept saying, "Let's get wet!" Trying to make light
of the rain, and make people feel better. (which he did) Then
people started to yell for Laurie to do the same. She declined.
Oh yeah, they played "Don't worry, be Happy" when the rain first started.
I hid in a makeshift shelter made from accumulated plastic bags.
An experience I won't forget.
