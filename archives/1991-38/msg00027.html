&gt;From article &lt;91Oct13.103424pdt.436280@wiretap.Spies.COM&gt;, by MTARR@EAGLE.WESLEYAN.EDU:
&gt; Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; Richard, you have a point.  There are people out there who go a bit far and
&gt; think Kate is a goddess incarnate, She Can Do No Wrong, and I think it's
&gt; good that there are people (like you) who remind them of that.  That's not
&gt; cynical- it's a voice of reason, albeit a sometimes overly harsh one... :)

Thank you.  It's nice to see that there are people out there who
accepted my post in the way that it was intended.  Thanks to everyone
who took it that way and particularly those who were kind enough to
speak up and point out that it may not have been so horrible as some
people are trying to paint it as having been.

Maybe I am a bit harsh at times.  But I try not to be any more harsh
than I need to be to make my point, or any more harsh in my responses 
than a post deserves.  If people feel I've been more harsh than 
necessary I would be interested in hearing about it through e-mail.  
You might find me saying, "Gee, I guess you're right." or you might 
find me saying, "Here's why I feel that I needed to put that so
sternly."
 
&gt; Vickie, no, you shouldn't congratulate Robyn.  Speaking of whom, where is
&gt; she?  People who have actually seriously asked where she got her information
&gt; haven't received an answer, most probably because she's been scared away.

Maybe I can clarify Robyn's situation somewhat.  For those who are
confused, Robyn is Tracy Robyn Sommerville, publisher of _Still
Breathing_ the Kate Bush fanzine and former co-publisher of now defunct 
_Breakthrough_ which has been widely recognized as one of the best Kate 
fanzines ever.  Her moniker says "Sommervill" sans the 'e' presumably 
because of an arbitrary limit on name lengths built into the software 
here.

Robyn has been calling The Big Sky long distance from Canada.  I
suggested when she first called that she would be better off connecting 
to Gaffa through one of the public access systems in her area code. 
I was sure that she would be interested in accessing frequently and
that would get expensive quickly.  I suggested mindlink or oneb from
her area code in the Nixpub listing but Robyn said she did not care 
for the management at those systems.  So for now Robyn is limited to 
sporadic access over long distance.  If anyone has suggestions for other 
systems through which Robyn might access more cost effectively, please 
send her mail and let her know.

Since Robyn hasn't called since her last post, she's sure to be way 
behind when she does call.  Just in case she doesn't get caught up
to the messages asking for details on her assertion that Kate would
not tour, I have sent her email asking for details.  If I hear anything
that she doesn't post here when she calls I will pass it along.

I certainly hope, along with everyone else, that what she has said is
not correct.
