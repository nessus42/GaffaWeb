Greg Bossert expostulates:
&gt;i *like* disagreement, i'm fascinated by emotional outpourings, 
&gt;i devote hours to obscure technical debates... like jon says,
&gt;KaTe's music is fertile enough to support a stinking jungle of
&gt;critical opinion... (urf, i *hope* jon said that -- i'd hate to think
&gt;i thought that up ;)

Yeah, that's close enough, Greg.

&gt;what i hate are *boring* posts!!!!

Amen to that, brother!

Jeffrey C. Burka opines:
&gt;But what Chris pointed out is that the Fairlight is not a sampler in the
&gt;conventional sense.  From Chris' description, it does much the same thing
&gt;that Alchemy for the Mac, which you mentioned, does--analyzes the input
&gt;sample, turning it into a synthesis algorhythm, allowing it to be played
&gt;back along a keyboard without the pitch being dependant upon playback
&gt;speed.

Chris, would you care to document this astounding claim?  As far as I am
aware, only the Synclavier does this particular trick.  I just talked to a
guy who used to work for Sequential and he confirms that the Fairlight was
just a big fancy sampler with some nice anti-aliasing circuitry.  I'm
certain that the I, II and IIx didn't do this.  I don't know about the III,
but I don't see any reason why it would, unless it was an add-on software
package.  Nothing I know of is fast enough to resynthesize in real time anyway,
unless it's a Cray or something.

&gt;So it might even be fair to say that the Fairlight *is* primarily
&gt;a synthesizer with a small sampler (and lots of number crunching additives)
&gt;tacked on...

I doubt it.  The original concept was to use short samples like today's
wavetable synths do, but people got more interested in just using the
samples on their own rather than as primitives for a traditional subtractive
synthesis model.  Listen to Who's Afraid Of The Art Of Noise - probably the
definitive Fairlight treatise.  Sounds like a normal sampler to me.

In other news, I just found a copy of Sussan Deihim and Richard Horowitz'
amazing album "Azax Attra" on CD, so I am a happy happy happy camper.
