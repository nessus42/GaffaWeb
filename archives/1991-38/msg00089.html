Subject: Re: The Death of Emotion
Chris here,

I posted:
&gt;&gt;    One symptom of an advanced case of cynicism, is to ascribe everyone
&gt;&gt; else's motives to cynicism. Misery loves company.

And Richard Caldwell replied:
&gt; Interesting that you should say so since it was Vickie that
&gt; started ascribing everyone else's motives to cynicism.  Feeling
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^| 
&gt; any less lonely yet?             |__No, just yours and Cynthias (and of
                                         course that boundless bundle of
                                         cynicism Jon.) 

  Richard, if I were to show randomly selected examples of your posts to
strangers on the street, I feel confident that the vast majority would use
the word "cynical" if asked to describe their general tone. Can you
honestly claim the same for my posts? I have several un-admirable qualities
(arrogence, no clothes sense) but cynicism is not one of them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You doubt the people who look at things from a fundamentally different 
&gt;&gt;&gt; point of view.  For you it's not possible that they are perfectly
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;   That "fundamentally different point of view" seems to consist of taking
&gt;&gt; an opposing viewpoint, no matter how strange, and defending it to the
&gt;&gt; death. You are in danger of becoming tiresome and predictable.

&gt; I don't always disagree everyone, just you.  Ok, so sometimes I
&gt; do agree with you but I do my best not to let on.
 
   Lord, how dull. What a sorry excuse for entertainment. I try to mention
the worthwhile points you make, no matter how stated.

&gt;&gt;&gt; have to account for their faults.  Try having a human being as a
&gt;&gt;&gt; hero for a change.  You'll find it not quite as easy, but much
&gt;&gt;&gt; more rewarding.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;    R-i-i-ight. This, from the guy who took me to task for daring to tell
&gt;&gt; Kate (through Lisa of the KBC) what I thought of the Box Set. _How_ many
&gt;&gt; different ways do you want to have it, Mr. Caldwell? _I_ was treating her
&gt;&gt; like a human who was party to a bad business decision, and _you_ reacted
&gt;&gt; as if I had piddled on your idol. A _little_ consistency, please!

&gt; My first response to your outburst was a simple disagreement on
&gt; the merits of the boxed set that you where impuning.  I have no
&gt; problem with such criticism and I certainly hope that the more
&gt; rational complaints about the boxed set have been well noted by
&gt; Kate.  I do not, however, agree that it is a "goddamn rip-off".

   It was. If you had seen the wonderful examples of Box Sets we saw in
England, by a huge variety of artists, every single one better and less
expensive than the Kate set. "Goddamn rip-off" is a reasonable way to
describe it.

&gt; My second mention of that little scene was as an example for Vickie 
&gt; of how you could become absurdly overzealous.  I hardly think that 
&gt; your little tantrum represents treating Kate as a human.  Rather, 
&gt; it seems to me to truely entail all the scorn and disrespect that
&gt; Vickie seemed to feel she saw in my post.  If you are incapable
&gt; of seeing the difference between my well considered, constructive
&gt; criticism and your heated cursing then I fear that you will find
&gt; little consistency here.

 A confession of a spur-of-the-moment conversation in a loud, crowded club
should not be judged by net-post standards. You were not at the convention
and, as the only report was my own, I don't see any basis for you to
characterize it as a tantrum. My statement was not judged harshly by the
Love-Hounds that were standing around Lisa and myself.

  The contents of the Box Set were entirely Kate's choice. The guy from
EMI lost Andy's list of suggestions and Dave Cross had to make up a list
overnight. Kate blythely crossed out any number of rarities that fans
would consider killing for (well, wounding at least) like "Maybe", the
second Peter and Kate song, etc. Just, "no, I don't know who has that"
and "that would be too hard to get rights to" without considering that
there are people employed by record companies to get rights and track
down master tapes. The Box set is one reason why an artist should not
attempt to be their own manager.

P.S. On the subject of adsurd overzealousness, I have not yet recieved
_any_ correspondence from anyone at AATHP/Little Light, let alone the
promised "proof". In fact, they have been entirely absent from the net
since I posted the comparison between their "statement from Kate" and
Kate's "message to Bush-Con." Am I to take their silence as an admission
of guilt and/or complacency that no amount of fudging can cover up?
