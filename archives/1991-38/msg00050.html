<PRE>
&gt; Vickie here.

I love this greeting, because it always makes it sound like you're ringing my
doorbell rather than starting an e-mail post.

&gt; Steve Berlin asks very thought-provoking questions:
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 8. Is Wilson Phillips going to be on her next album?  If not, why not?
&gt; 
&gt; This is a *very* well-kept secret! How did you find out? Yes, actually,
&gt; Kate and Carnie are even working on a single called "Ooh Baby Ohh"
&gt; and it should be out by Christmas. They are supposed to debut it on
&gt; a John Denver Christmas Special, but knowing Carnie, she'll back out.

And I heard that it was going to be debuted in honor of Kate's tour date
announcement!  Anyone want to take bets as to which will happen first?
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 7. Is John C. Bush the same person as Rod McKuen?  Their styles seem
&gt;&gt;    very similar.  (Sorry, this should have been in the FAQ file.  The
&gt;&gt;    answer is, of course:  yes, they are the same person).
&gt; 
&gt; Nonono! John is actually a Vogon. The Rod McKuen myth was started by
&gt; someone for some reason that only they know and I don't.

I think you've hit on something, here, Vickie!  Perhaps the reason we can't
understand JCB's poetry is in fact that it was not written for the sake of
anything meaningful, but just for the sake of something *bad*.  Hmm...

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 6. Is the boxed set coming out on 8-track tapes?
&gt; 
&gt; Only in Yugoslavia. Maybe Mexico too, but I'm not sure. I've heard that
&gt; it will come with one of those fuzzy things that you can put on your
&gt; rear-view mirror, but we'll see. 

Or one of those shaking hula girls that you always see on the dashboard of the
car in 'road-movies'...Perhaps one made in KaTe's image?

&gt;&gt; 3. The song "Wuthering Heights".  Is this, like, from, like, a book
&gt;&gt;    or something, y'know?
&gt; 
&gt; No, it's based on a play by Andrew Lloyd Weber, which itself was inspired
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
No, no, no, no, no.  In fact, ALW wrote a musical based on Wuthering
Heights...Hmmm...I think it was called "KaTe Bush Superstar", and involved some
silly story about KaTe being a goddess or something.  



Thank you, Steve &amp; Vickie, for a *wonderful* reprieve from all the cat-fighting
(does dax make this a cat-house?) that's been going on around here lately.
