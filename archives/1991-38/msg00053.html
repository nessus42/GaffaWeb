   OKAY, ENOUGH ALREADY! CAN WE PLEASE STOP ALL THE INCESSANT BITCHING
AT EACH OTHER THAT BEEN TAKING UP SO MANY INCREDIBLE LINES OF BANDWIDTH
LATELY? DISCUSSION OF DIVERSING OPINIONS HAS ALWAYS BEEN WELCOME, BUT
THE CONSTANT PISSING, MOANING AND CHILDISHNESS OF SOME POSTS LATELY HAS
MADE ME SICK TO THE POINT WHERE READING GAFFA LATELY IS NO LONGER FUN, BUT
REALLY GIVES ME A SCREAMING HEADACHE! YES, WE'RE ALL ENTITLED TO OUR 
PARTICULAR POINTS OF VIEW, BUT LATELY THINGS HAVE REACHED A NEW LOW WITH
ALL THE MUD-SLINGING, RUDENESS, NAME-CALLING AND SIMPLE IMMATURITY THAT'S
BEEN GOING ON. I, FOR ONE, AM TRULY NAUSEATED TO KNOW THAT SOME OF US JUST
CAN'T USE A LITTLE COMMON SENSE AND TACT WHEN DEALING WITH OTHERS.... (THIS
WHOLE MESS HAS ME SO UPSET I'M CONVERSING ENTIRELY IN CAPS! SHEESH!)
  PLEASE, IF YOU WANT TO DISAGREE WITH SOMONE, BY ALL MEANS DO SO, BUT SHOW
A LITTLE INTELLIGENCE AND RESPECT, HUH? WE ARE ALL ADULTS HERE, RIGHT? LET'S
ACT LIKE IT! 

  I, FOR ONE, WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE THE FOCUS OF THIS GROUP RETURN
TO SUCH TOPICS AS DEAR KATE, SIMILAR ARTIST, AND RELATED SUBJECTS....

  PARDON ME FOR BEING SO DIRECT AND UPFRONT, AND I'M SORRY IF I OFFENDED
ANYBODY, BUT I FELT THIS NEEDED TO BE SAID.....

  THE ABOVE COMMENT WERE NOT DIRECTED AT ANY ONE PERSON IN SPECIFIC, BUT
I'M HOPING THAT A CERTAIN GROUP OF ABOUT 5 OR 6 PEOPLE (I'LL BE NICE AND
POLITE AND NOT MENTION ANY NAMES) WILL GET THE HINT.....


  Oh! anyone else know any more about a rumour that the b-sides from the
boxed set will be released as two discs as a set in their own right?

  I'd hate to shell out all that money for the boxed set when I already
have all the other cds except for the two of rarities...
