&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have any idea what she means by that "ley lines" comment?

      Turner said, ". . . But see, quite a few of your oldest
    cathedrals are sited according to ancient principles of
    geomancy.  For exmaple, they might take some animal and turn
    it loose -- . . .  Say a cow.  And they'd kind of let it run
    loose."

      The truck was barely moving.  The countryside seemed to
    rotate around them, as though they were at its very hub. . .

       "But see, the cow, it would like, do whatever it did,
    until after a while, it would, stop!"

      Turner look out the window into a motionless yellow field.
    "We're not really lost," he said . . .  "We've just . . .
    stopped. . . do you know what they found at the place where
    the cow stopped?  . . .  When some dowser showed up . . .
    usually they discovered two underground streams, at least
    two, coming together right underneath that very spot.
    Sometimes there would even be a spring or something. . .
    What this means," said Turner, concerned that he might just
    conceivably not be making himself one hundred percent clear,
    "is that geologically speaking you have two separate things
    going on, two levels of history -- at least two -- right at
    the same place, where eventually maybe a cathedral or
    something would get built.  Standing stones, maybe.  Sort of
    an intersection, a crossroads . . ."

      "Oh, sure."  Vinny walked back toward the truck, making
    cross-signs.  "Lines of power.  Dragon paths.  All that
    retro-pagan bullshit.  Right?"

      . . . In the roadway stood a tall man wearing clothes made
    out of leather, with a beard down to his stomach and a
    walking stick as big around as a bat.  He looked like Rip Van
    Winkle after an especially long afternoon at the bowling
    alley . . .

      Turner . . . said, "Why were you going through the fields?
    Are the roads dangerous around here?"

      The man pulled his stick out of the ground and gestured
    with it, tracing a line in the soil.  "We have been following
    the old track. . .  It's difficult for some people to make
    out, but it's there, if you can follow it.  It goes all the
    way to the mountains -- and beyond that, I would guess. . ."

The above is excerpted from _Views From The Oldest House_, by Richard
Grant.  A practical example of ley lines at work.
