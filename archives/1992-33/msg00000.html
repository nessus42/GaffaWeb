 Call me a stoic but I don't think one's plight in life gives an 
&gt; excuse to victimize another whether it's the card holder, a store or 
&gt; Kate. If something's wrong then fix i, don't add to it which is what 
&gt; theft does.

Capitalism and the concept of "accumulation of capital"  has had many
victims.  Theft is merely an opposite:  It does not have to be done by 
a poor starving soul to be classified as a reaction/strike against the 
system, anyone can do it.  But remember that striking back at the 
system has risks.  I believe that if someone is prepared to accept those
risks, fine.  I dont believe that there is something intrinsically 
sacred about "private property" so that its violation should be 
considered morally wrong.  It is unfortunate that making music,
or creating a painting is currently so tied into money/currency 
that issues such as copywriting etc basically govern who gets
to enjoy those resources (which inturn is governed by our racist/ 
sexist/homophobic societies).  Theft puts the system in spin, which
I personally enjoy the concept of.  However it is unfortunate when 
the "real" victims happen to be honest ethical busness people (I hope
you didn't take my comments as a personal affront since I do 
sympathise with you).

&gt;I also think you idealize Kate a bit too much. I could care 
&gt; less if she stole candy as a child but I have my reservations she would 
&gt; condone such behavior in adults, and on a much more pricey scale --- 
&gt; remember Kate herself has been a victim of burglarly. Have you ever been 
&gt; robbed in any manner? If you have try to recall that feeling of emptiness 
&gt; and hopelessness, not because you no longer have a material possession 
&gt; but because a violation had been committed against you. 

I've had my apt broken into and stuff stolen and I wanted to kill the thief!
I agree with you completely.  However I don't idealize Kate Bush at all.
I've heard good stuff about her which has further drawn me to her music.
But I'm merely a listener.  I like what her words say, and assume her
character a bit.  And having lived in London on and off during my 
childhood I pictured a pretty rebelious child (I met many "rebels" in 
London as a kid, one of whom stole my bike:(.....still remember it ).


I know the risks 
&gt; of being in business, they're just like the risks involved in breathing, 
&gt; eating, sleeping...life is a risk. I will make a sweeping moral statement 
&gt; about stealing being bad; it's about time people took responsibility for 
&gt; their own actions instead of finding scape goats as to why they acted 
&gt; liek a child (taking candy?).

Even though I disagree with you about "good" vs "bad", I understand 
where you're coming from.  I will add that business is a greater risk
than life in general.....9 out of 10 businesses fail in a year!  

Good Luck.
