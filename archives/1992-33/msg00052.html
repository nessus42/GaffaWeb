Well, I've just got to tell my story, too!!

Sometime around Jan, 1978, I was at home in Corner Brook, Nfld,
studying for a Calculus exam and listening to CBC Radio. At
that time they were broadcasting a World Top 10 (or something like
that). They played this song with the most incredible eery vocals...
Wuthering Heights. I was really spellbound by this song but did
not catch the woman's name.

Flash forward to Sept. 1979. I'm in residence at Memorial University
in St. John's, Nfld. One of the girls plays this record....
and it's Wuthering Heights. I yell 'WHO IS THAT??? I HAVE to know.'
And thus, I learned of Kate Bush. 

And there started my following. Since then, I collected everything
she did (that I could get my hands on).     

'The Dreaming' was sublime. I was VERY happy with that one....
And 'Hounds of Love': Incredible.

Ahhhh... I could rave on about every album.

I do feel like an old fart though after reading a lot of people's
Kate stories!!

----------------------------------------------------------------

I would like to take time here to thank those of you who pass
on information about other artists. Yeah, I'm a Tori fan, too
and I'm still winding down from her Ottawa gig which was
astounding!

Also, I believe it was Jon Drukman who mentioned 'Single Gun
Theory' months and months ago (Correct me if I'm wrong).
This is an ASTOUNDING release and I wish that it had more exposure.

Peter Gabriel fans: am I alone in being disappointed with 'Us'?
I really like 'Digging in the Dirt' and the first part of 'Love
to Be Loved' but so far, it hasn't gripped like I wish it had.

I'm also quite fond of 'Warpaint' by Happy Rhodes.

Please keep mentioning other artists!! I've been rewarded immensely.
