Thought I'd share my first experiences of Kate before people tire of
them.  I first saw Her I-don't-know-when on an ABBA (Christmas?) special
shot in Switzerland.  The song she performed was 'Wow' (I think, judging
by the waving of the arms, which is about all I remember--was she
sitting atop the piano to begin with?)  I *hated* it!  But then again, I
was watching the show for ABBA, not expecting anyone like Kate.  She
must have been pretty young then.  Having alerted my piano teacher that
the show would be aired, she watched it as well, and at my next lesson
expressed her fondness for Kate's performance.  Suffice it to say, I
thought she was sick!

Well, some years later, I started watching a community TV music video
show in Calgary, hosted by a local record-store worker.  He obviously
had (pardon the expression) a hard-on for Kate, artistically speaking
that is.  The Dreaming was out at this time, and I remember him
explaining the photo on the front cover, how it related to the album's
contents (and Houdini has been one of my favourites ever since).  The
vids I remember most vividly were Babooshka and Sat in Your Lap.  Not
long after that, I came across a broadcast of the Hammersmith show, and
have been hooked ever since.

Maybe I'm a purist, but I would recommend that new fans start with the
early stuff, and move on from there.  I think it'd be hard to get used
to Her early voice otherwise, and it's an interesting study in musical
(and lyrical) evolution.  (And yes, by the way, I still like ABBA --
cauliflower I can take or leave.)


Peace,
