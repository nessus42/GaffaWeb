I can see the attraction of a lot of dance music. Don't get me wrong, I 
don't hate it. I like a lot of '80s soul and dance, and I don't think I 
could bear to listen to Kate non-stop all year round. I like to step out 
'into the sensual world' and enjoy some relaxing music other than Kate's 
(at the moment, it's The Cranberries and Eternal (don't laugh)). Just 
that I seem to go through a cycle during the year, and by winter I'm sure 
I'll be listening to "The Ninth Wave" again. I just feel Kate's music, 
especially from TD onwards, is more escapist than other artists', even 
people like Tori Amos (sorry to have to mention her). I mean (I think I 
may have said this before), for me, Kate's music is like a good film. For 
the time I spend listening to it, I can escape into somebody else's world 
and maybe even think about its relevance to my own life.

James, you also mention that you think TRS is nearly a concept album. 
Well, listening to "Constellation of the Heart" she sings the line "Just 
being alive, it can really hurt", which is also heard in "Moments of 
Pleasure" and, I think - excuse my memory, "And So Is Love". Perhaps this 
track was originally intended to be part of a longer story than Kate's 
film turned out to be. Also, in "Constellation..." and "Top of the City" 
she sings about a ladder that will take her to heaven/the top of the 
city. Maybe this track too was supposed to be in the film.

Alan.

&gt; For me, dance music is the exact opposite.  First of all, the pop genre is
&gt; designed for passive aquisition, somthing to be listened to while doing
&gt; something else entirely.  Dance music however asks for active
&gt; participation.  It is for people who have gone somewhere to do something:
&gt; dance.  Unlike Kate's music, which invites in the casual listener for a
&gt; journey of self awareness, much dance music is designed to kidnap the
&gt; purposefull listener into unconciousness of self.  

&gt; Now, speaking of taking the listener on a trip, there is the Red Shoes.  I
&gt; have always felt that it is really nearly a concept album, the sunrise to
&gt; sunset of a relationship.  I ought to say more, but I'm thunk out, so I'll
&gt; skip it.
