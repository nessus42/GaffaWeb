The Glory of Gershwin is currently in the top 20 album list here in
Australia.  Kate sings a beautiful 'The Man I Love'.  Since I am fond of
GErshwin and of some of the artists on this album, I had to buy it.
There are a few tracks that I found disappointing; Robert Palmer's
version of 'I Got Rhythm' does not work for me, I have a version of
'Rhapsody in Blue' that I much prefer, I haven't managed to actually
listen to all of Courtney Pine's version of 'Summertime'.  I was surprised
that I enjoyed Meatloaf's 'Somebody Loves Me', but I have never listened
to Meatloaf much so it might be my fault for having such a preconceived
notion of what he would sound like. Most of the tracks are quite
enjoyable though.

Not only do I now own the album but I have a copy of Kate singing the
song on video.  It's done in black and white, and is simply showing Kate
singing with some of the members of the orchestra they had set up for
the album.  A lucky capture from the Australia show RAGE which plays a
variety of music videos Saturday and Sunday mornings from 1 to 8 am.

For those who might be interested, a list of tracks from the album.
Press n now if either a) you know them or b) you don't care.
