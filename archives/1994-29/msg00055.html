I got this EMail from IGG.  Again, I must say that I'm staying neutral in
the whole "who to buy I shirt from" thing.

For people ordering via EMail, the price is still $12 ($13 for XXL), and
will stay there until Allan feels like raising the price.
Also, I had incorrectly reported that he has no mediums - well, he does.
This offer is only good for Net folk (everyone else pays an extra $3.00),
but why anyone NOT on the net would want a shirt that says
"lovehounds@uunet.uu.net" is beyond me.  Of course, the shirts DO
look so amazingly wonderful (IMNS(and completely biased)O) that a lot
of my friends who are KateFans(tm) but not on the Net just HAD to have
one.

Note for you Big People out there - Mary-Helen's XXLs are only $12, and
she has no plans of raising the price for anyone at any time.

Anyway, here's an edited version of the Email I got from IGG.  I deleted
some of it for brevity; anything in brackets are my comments.

Steve -

[snip]

The Deal:
The rec.music.gaffa t-shirt m-xl for $12, XXL $13 for net-based orders.
(you do not have to email - you can call and ASK for the net price!)
$4 p&amp;h in the US (others call or write first)

The IGG Shirt deal: buy m-xl gaffa shirt for $14.99 (xxl=$15.99) and receive
FREE L or XL (our choice at this point) FRUITOPIA 100percent cotton Tee! +
unused TLTCTC ticket from one of the Sept 11 shows (yes, kate's pic is on the
tic!) + current IGG list of Kate goodies. 

[Um, I'm trying to stay neutral here, but isn't that paying an extra 3 bucks
for the "Free" Fruitopia shirt &amp; ticket?]
