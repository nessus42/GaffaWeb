<PRE>
the latest issue of 'q' magazine has a sinead cover story in which she tells of
her attempt at suicide during the secret world tour. but was it only the first
leg of the tour on which she performed? as i have posted before, i am quite
certain sinead performed on the final night in london, as i could have been
there if i had not been a complete wanker to this guy i was dating at the time.
he went, i stayed home and i STILL haven't seen sinead live.

b/t/w, has anybody else out there heard the sinead/willie nelson version of
'don't give up'? it is quite nice. i like it better than the original actually.
sinead's vocals are less hopeful than kate's, more subdued, quite breathy.

does anybody know who duets with peter on the new secret world tour live album?
it came out just the other night at a midnight sale.

also, did anyone else out there rush out and buy 'universal mother' the night
it came out? i did that night, standing in line for 40 minutes with the other
sinead, they might be giants and peter gabriel fans. .. . .

i am still not completely sold on it (universal mother), mostly cuz i have
only listened to it once all the way through. it is very laid-back and soft for
the most part, although that makes it all the more impressive when she gets
loud. the 'soft stuff' is sandwiched between two very loud songs--the single
'fire on babylon,' which is about her mother and her own motherhood, and
'famine,' which features rap verses about the mythical nature of the irish
potato famine and the very real effects it had, sandwiched between sung choruses
of 'eleanor rigby' by the beatles. i am quite taken with both of those tracks
. . . . . .
