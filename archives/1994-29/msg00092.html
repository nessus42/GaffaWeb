Yes, MoP is one of my very favorites on TRS.  It's so pretty, and so 
emotional...Yes, she is..

Yeah, after a while this song started sounding more cheesy to me, but at 
first it caught me nearing the throes of a breakup.  Ack, I cried.

Yup.  Sorta a lull in the action....
: After playing 'The Red Shoes' for some time, I decided to buy the other

: different aspect of Kate...it would be difficult to imagine from just  
: hearing TRS, that she was capable of something so conceptual as TNW/HoL or  
: as Alternativish as The Dreaming...but I have yet to be disappointed, and  
: hearing all these other albums hasn't lessened my enjoyment of TRS. 
Damn great stuff, it's true....
: It is nice to be able to buy an album, and not have any expectations, and  
: still know it will be a good album, just because it has Kate Bush written

: some people...I honestly cant imagine where all the negative reviews that

I was expecting it with great and massive antici------pation.  And in 
some ways I was dissapointed.  But it's nice to here some good ythings 
about TRS.  I *did* enjoy it a lot.
: The only really annoying thing about the whole experience is that  
: occasionally, for no reason I will say 'it's the red shoes' in the middle  
: of a conversation....and at the most inappropriate times.
Hee hee!  would that that happened to more people!
: Thanks for your time,
