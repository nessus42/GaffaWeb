&gt;      Ick! Does ANYONE like her sappy ballad stuff? Just *thinking*
&gt;      of "My Man"
&gt;  thrusts my blood-sugar levels dangerously high. 

I hope not! But I'm sure someone out there does.

 For me, her last good song until the Yoko/Ima album
&gt;  (can't remember the title offhand) came out was "I'm Moving On"
&gt;  from _Double Fantasy_. It seems you ought to like _Double Fantasy_
&gt;  since you like "Kiss Kiss Kiss" (I didn't). 

I have a tape of _Double Fantasy_ and the other one she did with John
with alternating tracks. I like about half her songs on there on
average. Been a while since I've listened though, since I don't listen
to tapes that much.

I highly recommend the
&gt;  new album (with IMA), it really rocks! "Ask The Dragon" is her best
&gt;  song in a long time! 

Yeah, I heard a track either off it or the remix cd, and I wanted to
get it. I don't know the name of the song--I just heard it on the
radio once (college radio).

Considering you like "Yangyang", I'd recommend
&gt;  _Approximately Infinite Universe_ and _Feeling The Space_. _Feeling
&gt;  The Space_ is the best bet, probably; it's shorter and has a
&gt;  greater percentage of good tracks ("Coffin Car" is another
&gt;  favourite).

Thanks for the suggestions. I will have to look into them.

&gt; &gt;I noticed a bunch 
&gt; &gt;were rereleased recently. Are there any you would &gt;recommend? 
&gt; 
&gt;      Hmmm...hard to say. Her early stuff (like _Fly_ and _Yoko
&gt;      Ono/Plastic Ono
&gt;  Band_) was still very entrenched in avantgarde music, and is not
&gt;  dissimilar in style to other avant-garde vocalists of the time
&gt;  (like Cathy Berberian and Meredith Monk). That stuff is very
&gt;  strange, but if you have the stamina for it, very rewarding as
&gt;  well. The infamous "Don't Worry Kyoko" dates from that period,
&gt;  which a friend of mine correctly observes "seems to be the only
&gt;  Yoko Ono song anyone has heard".

Well, I can take experimental (I like Meridith Monk, at least what
I've heard by her, and I also listen to various avant-garde music from
Harry Partch to Nurse with Wound). Just as long as I don't have to
hear cheesy ballads! *g*

Thanks for the suggestions (from everyone who's posted them)--now I
have even more excuses to go CD shopping. (Like I need an excuse. 
*g*)
