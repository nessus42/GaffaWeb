&gt;Apparently we have Karen to thank for posting to Love-Hounds THE BIGGEST NEWS
&gt;OF THE YEAR!!  Here is IED's quick, more or less accurate (though scarcely
&gt;idiomatically faithful) translation.

&gt;(A)  Another concept album?
&gt;
&gt;(D)  Absolutely.  The idea was to imagine it not as a work with a break in
&gt;the middle, but as a single sonic design.  Very complicated.  [IED cannot
&gt;prevent himself from interrupting here to say CAN YOU BELIEVE HOW GREAT THIS
&gt;NEWS IS?!  Sorry.]

I am literally tingling all over reading this!

&gt;It will consist of a private album [with the sound characterized as] a type
&gt;of first-run-through (this is the significance of Del's phrase "with no break
&gt;in the middle,") as was the case with "Hounds of Love":  there will be a
&gt;continuous recalling of sounds throughout the entire work.  "A continuity,"
&gt;as Del himself put it.

I get the feeling that this is going to be a landmark release for Kate.
Hopefully on par with The Ninth Wave.

&gt;Gilmour, in April, had spoken of "a song divided into three parts, or at
&gt;least for now that's how it is.  It could be divided up into three segments
&gt;or into three specific phases." 

And it has one of the few God's I worship on it as well! :^)

&gt;In other news:  Del also spoke of a trip undertaken recently by Kate (in the
&gt;company of one of her elder relatives).  He said that she was gone for twenty
&gt;days, making stops in Helsinki, Stockholm, Rome, Madrid, Lyons, Paris,
&gt;Zurich, Dortmund. In each of these cities she visited the theatres.  In Rome
&gt;they spoke of the Assiago Forum, but when they learned that it was used as a
&gt;small sports arena they ruled it out.  It was suggested to her that, instead
&gt;, there were very beautiful venues in Milan but she replied, laughing:  "Yes,
&gt;La Scala!"

That would be right, she finally might do a tour, and I am living in
totally the wrong part of the world. I would be *EXTREMELY* (but
pleasantly) surprised if Kate tours.

Many thanks to IED for translating this for the list. It's not often we get
little gems like this off the internet.
