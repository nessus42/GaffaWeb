This is very similar to the British folk song "Two Magicians" (a.k.a. 
"Oh Coal Black Smith." In that song, the female character is pursued 
by a male character and both transform themselves various times. In 
this song, it's very clear that the female is trying to avoid rape.

I remember when I first got on Lovehounds there was discussion of 
some song Kate did that was similar to or inspired by "Two 
Magicians." At the time, I didn't realize this was the same song (or 
at least the same lyrics) as "Oh Coal Black Smith" by Current 93, so 
I didn't pay that much attention to what Kate song was being 
discussed. I don't think it was "GOOMH," but my memory isn't always 
the greatest;&gt; 

I'm fairly certain someone said she was inspired in one of her own 
songs by this folk song. As someone who was raised around trad folk 
music, she would most likely be familiar with this song anyway even 
if she didn't directly cite it as an influence. Even if she didn't 
directly connect it with "GOOMH," the parallels are there.
