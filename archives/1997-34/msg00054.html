Hi gang!

In this whole Cloubusting/gay (and now Get Out of My House/rape) song 
interpretation thing, I think everyone is forgetting one thing:

Kate tends to have *layers* of meanings.  

It isn't simply a matter of finding the *one* meaning Kate intended; 
good heavens, a great deal of her work is based on puns, 
double-meanings and such (The entire song "Babooshka", for instance, 
is a play on the double-meaning of the word).

I believe that Kate has said that Get Out of My House was inspired by 
the Shining, but some of the lines seem very much like the "house" is 
a metaphor for a body.  Couldn't it be that clever ole Kate had 
several layers of meanings going?

Same goes for Cloubusting.  I don't know the specifics of Peter 
Reich's life (although I do know that his Pop had some wacky ideas 
about sex!!!).  The song is "based on" his book, but that doesn't mean 
that Kate didn't allow herself creative license.  The fact that she 
cross-dresses in the video is interesting, and as a gay person, I can 
certainly see parallels to homosexuality in the song (what made it 
special, made it dangerous).  It is quite possible that all of these 
things are metaphoric, that she is operating on a bunch of different 
levels, and there are many meanings bleeding through at once.  Isn't 
it?

 
Matt
