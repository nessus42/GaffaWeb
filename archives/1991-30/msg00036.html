Following are two press releases issued earlier this month by the
legendary Cleveland, Ohio "Avant Garage" band, Pere Ubu. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PERE UBU IN LETTERMAN FUND RAISING APPEAL

August 9, 1991- Avant garde rock pioneers, Pere Ubu, announced today that they
are seeking financial contributions from their fans and fellow musicians for
the purpose of funding the group's trip to New York City for an appearance on
NBC's "Late Night with David Letterman" on Wednesday, September 11th. The
group is taking this highly unusual measure due to the equally unusual refusal
of their record company, Mercury Records, to pay the $2500 cost of their
visit.

Pere Ubu, founded in Cleveland in 1975, are widely regarded as one of the most
creative and influential groups to emerge from the late 70's new wave scene.
The band's 11th album (their 2nd on Mercury Records) "Worlds in Collision" was
released in late May and has been their swiftest selling ever. As is usual for
Ubu, the album and a June mini-tour both garnered uniformly excellent reviews.
A new single, the album's title track, was sent to radio last week and the
band have been invited to support a major tour in the Fall.

Speaking from his home in London, Ubu's lead singer David Thomas said "We've
always depended on the kindness of strangers. So we've simply extended the
concept of listener supported radio. It's the avant garage rent party. We
wanna be on tv. You want us to be on tv. So it's time for y'all to pay up."
Contributions (unfortunately non-tax-deductible) should be made payable to Ubu
Projex and sent to Ubu's representatives, The Hornblow Group USA, Inc., 24
Hudson Avenue, Edgewater, N.J. 07020. Contributors will receive an official
Pere Ubu Avant Garage sticker as a token of the band's appreciation.

FANS, BANDS FLOCK TO SUPPORT PERE UBU'S LETTERMAN APPEAL

August 20, 1991- In an unprecedented show of support for a fellow artist, many
of the top names in rock music have responded to Pere Ubu's appeal for
contributions to send the Cleveland avant-rockers to New York City for an
appearance on NBC's "Late Night with David Letterman" Wednesday, September
11th. Pere Ubu announced their fund raising drive last week following the
refusal of their record company, Mercury Records, to pay the $2500 cost of
their visit.

Following reports of the fund raising drive on MTV and in the national press,
contributions have been pouring in from Ubu's fans, fellow musicians and
friends in the musical community. The list of artists who have pledged their
support so far reads like a veritable Who's Who of modern rock: Lou Reed,
R.E.M., the B-52's, Jane's Addiction, Iggy Pop, Don Was, Living Colour, They
Might Be Giants, the Pixies, Marshall Crenshaw, the Buzzcocks, Meat Puppets,
the Feelies, the Sisters of Mercy and Miracle Legion. Also prominent among the
contributors have been executives and employees of a number of record
companies including, ironically, Mercury Records.

"Rock 'n' roll is really all about moving big black boxes back and forth
across town in the back of a car," says Ubu's lead singer, David Thomas. "So
it's a really cool thing to find out your new buddy's got a station wagon you
can use. It's extremely gratifying to learn that we have so many friends who
are willing to help out. Our thanks to everyone for their support."
