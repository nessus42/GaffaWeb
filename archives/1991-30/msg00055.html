This Labor Day weekend KITS San Francisco is counting down the "105
Greatest Modern Rock Artists of All Time", as voted on by the listeners.
It's similar to the Memorial Day weekend countdown, except that instead
of counting down 300 songs, it counts down 105 artists and plays three
tracks from each.

It's sort of an annual coundown.  I say "sort of" because last year
they did something different.  They counted down the 105 greatest albums
of all time, and played three tracks from each.  Relatively obscure
artists like Kate have a much better chance on the artist countdown they
ran this year than on the album countdown, because there are the same
number of positions, but artists have more than one album.  Staple KITS
artists, like the Smiths, Depeche Mode, and the Cure, had several albums
included, taking away space from people like Kate.

Anyway, on this year's countdown Kate placed No. 44, only slightly worse
than she placed two years ago (she was No. 40 then).  They played:

"Running Up That Hill"
"Love And Anger"
A promo:  "'Live-105' with a classic -- a modern rock classic!"
"Wuthering Heights" (new vocal)

The DJ said, afterwards, "I'm sure she'd love to tour the United States,
but she's afraid of flying, so maybe she'll take a boat."

I didn't get a chance to vote this year, because the voting started
as I was leaving for Montreal, and ended before I got back.  Maybe if
I would have voted it would have moved up a notch!

While W.H. was playing Jill called me up to tell me they were playing
Kate on KITS.  I told her I already knew.  My roommate happened to
hear it, and he said, "That IS a beautiful song."  I've sort of hooked
him!
