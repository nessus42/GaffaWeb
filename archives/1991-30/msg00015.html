&gt;Just curious: Why in the world are people so concerned whether KaTe
&gt;has written some gay-male-positive lyrics when she herself is female?
&gt;It's not just the heterosexual males who would Just Die if she got
&gt;married, either; I've seen some women posting in this thread.
&gt;
&gt;Kate is an artist.  Kate probably knows *lots* and *lots* of gay men
&gt;and lesbians, and maybe some of them are close friends with her.  Kate
&gt;has written about Houdini, murder, incest, cloudbusting, dreams,
&gt;(heterosexual) sexual relations, pregnancy, women struggling over
&gt;various obstacles, surreal experiences, and a jillion other topics.  I
&gt;think it's safe to assume she hasn't personally experienced some of
&gt;these things, but has experienced others.  Why assume that writing
&gt;about gay men means Something's Wrong?

Now I haven't been following this thread all that closely, but I dont'
recall anyone having said that there was something wrong with KaTe
writing a song that dealt with gay males! If my memory doesn't betray
me, the thread began when someone caught a comment about "Kashka..."
being about a pair of men and was thereupon surprised. Not offended,
just surprised.  I've thought it was about two men for as long as I
remember and possibly from the first time I ever heard the song since
I was reading LHs before I got the album.  

As you point out, she writes about anything and everything, so it
would seem that a fan should only be surprised if she *hadn't* written
a song like Kashka &amp; Wow (speculation or fact, you be the judge
*grin*)

(PS: If I have 5 Happy Rhodes albums, do I have them all? the results
of KaTemas at Greg's I'm afraid....)
