&gt;Being fairly new to the group, I don't know if this CD has been

It HAS been discussed here, but not for a while, so that's OK.  It came
out around the spring of 1990.

&gt;The Sensual World (LP version)
&gt;Be Kind To My Mistakes
&gt;Im Still Waiting
&gt;Ken
&gt;The Sensual World (instrumental version)

&gt;I know some people will hate me for saying it, but I like the song
&gt;Ken. Its nice to have a fun song once in a while.

I think it's pretty good, too.  As you say, an occasional change is nice.

&gt; Anyway
&gt;could someone tell me the purpose of this album? Only one song
&gt;was taken from TSW, and that was TSW. What was the film, _The Castaways_
&gt;about? And the comic strip film GLC?

No one really knows the purpose of any extra record releases -- we're
just glad they come out!  However, it seems to include most of the 
B-sides for the British singles that came from the album.

Castaway was a film starring Oliver Reed and Amanda Donahoe (now
of L.A. Law fame), and directed by Nicholas Roeg.  "Be Kind To My
Mistakes" was played over the opening credits.  The film was a flop,
at least in the USA, which is why you've never heard of it.  It is,
however, available on video, and large rental places have it.

Actually, there are three versions of the song:  The one on the very-rare
soundtrack album, which is the longest version; the one in the movie
itself, which cuts off before the end; and the one that was the B-Side
for "This Woman's Work" and also appears on AotSW, which is much shorter
than the other versions, and is mixed somewhat differently.  Vickie Mapes
says this is the "mutilated" version.

The Comic Strip film "GLC" was a half hour program shown on the BBC.
It was shown for the first time in the spring on 1990, and it was
shown again more recently.  All the music from this film, which includes
several instrumental pieces besides "Ken", was written by Kate. 
Unfortunately, in America the only way to see this is to find a Kate
fan that has a copy on tape transferred from PAL to NTSC.

&gt;It has a really nice cover, the same as a single I saw (cant rmemeber what
&gt;it was, only remember it was 6.95 on vinyl -- the small type).

The single is "The Sensual World", the first British single from that
album.
