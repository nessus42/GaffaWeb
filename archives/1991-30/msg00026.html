Vickie here. I've starting corresponding with a Russian who has
just become interested in Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel. I asked 
his permission to post his letter in rec.music.gaffa and he said 
it would be fine. Here is his original letter and excerpts from a 
follow-up letter. I've left the header in because I think it's
interesting.

Bill, please add him to the mailing list. I told him about rec.music.gaffa
but he didn't indicate in his follow-up letter that he was able to find
it.

I did send him a quick discography.

&gt; Subject: Re: Hello!!!!!!!!


&gt; I'm 18 now. I'm study in university at the second grade. I'm a system
&gt; programmer, and somewhere consider myself a hacker. I use computers
&gt; since I'm was 12 years old. About area: I live in the Kabardino-Balkarian
&gt; republic, it belong to the Russia. The Nalchik is the town where I live.

&gt;&gt; How did you find out about them? Were you in Europe or America or did
&gt;&gt; someone send you tapes or can you buy the music there? What music do you
&gt;&gt; already have by them?

&gt; I hate the 'heavy metal', 'pop' etc... because it's don't so hard for me
&gt; would be to know about them. But buy it's more hard for me.
&gt; I don't have the own once :( But I heard some stuffs, and I'm liked it.

&gt;&gt; The e-mail address (for Love-Hounds) has changed so I'm not sure what
&gt;&gt; it is, but I'll find out if you are interested.

&gt; Yes, I'm interested.

&gt;&gt; May I have your permission to post your letter to me in rec.music.gaffa?

&gt; Of course! Feel free to send my letter anywhere.

&gt;&gt; I know all Kate Bush fans on the net would be interested in knowing 
&gt;&gt; that there is a fan in the USSR. Perhaps other fans would want to
&gt;&gt; write to you. Would that be alright with you?

&gt; Yeah, of course. I'll be glad to write back and forth with anybody fans!!!

&gt;&gt; Your English is very good. Did you study English in school or did you
&gt;&gt; visit or live in Europe or America?

&gt; No I was never lived in either Europe or America! :-) :-) :-)
&gt; I studied basic english grammars in the school, but mainly my knowns came
&gt; from the 'chats' with computers.

&gt;&gt; How long have you been reading the music newsgroups?

&gt; I'm began read the music newsgroups about 1 years ago. And by the way...
&gt; I wrote about 2 articles in the rec.music.misc.

&gt;&gt; What Kate Bush lyrics are you interested in?

&gt; I'm interesting for all lyrics that you have about K. Bush and P. Gabriel.
&gt; I don't know more about P. Gabriel and K. Bush so excuse me, and don't
&gt; curious, please. Any info I appricated with great lucky!!

&gt; Here is location of my town in the USSR. Hope that it will be
&gt; understandable!

Vickie again, as I said, I sent him a short discography. Just the albums
and TWS, TWW, The Cathy Demos and mentioned that there were lots of
b-sides and other non-album songs. I don't think he needs a complete
discography right now. Obviously, very little is available to him now
and a full listing won't do him much good.

As far as lyrics, we can't ftp, and I don't know if he can. Perhaps 
someone could start sending him lyrics (in very small chunks please!)
but whoever does should SPEAK UP!! so he doesn't get lots of lyrics
from lots of different people. Volunteers anyone? 

I can't help him with Peter Gabriel lyrics. I keep spacing off joining
the PG mailing list. Anyone out there who's part of it? Do they have
ftp-able lyrics? 

I asked him about his feelings toward what's been going on in the USSR
the past couple of weeks. He's going to write back with his thoughts.

This is GREAT! I'm so excited that now we'll have a Russian Love-Hound!
He's just getting into Kate though, and if he becomes a fan he can
spread the word to his friends.
