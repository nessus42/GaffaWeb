Regarding Kate on Bravo..
        I did happen to see the "Love and Anger" video on Bravo last 
week.  They seemed to be using it as a filler in between shows.  Perhaps 
this is what Larry's friend saw.
 
Regarding Kate on MTV and E!
        I haven't seen "Regarding Henry" so I can't comment on wether 
TSW was in it or not.  I do remember that the movie prievew MTV played 
with it was for "The Big Man".
 
Regarding Kate purchases...
        I imagine that although one post said that "The Singles File"
video release was not to happen, the fact that someone purchased one is
a sign to the contrary.  It is obvious that I need to get to a Tower soon.
The Tower at Columbus and Bay (San Francisco) had about 4 copies of TWW
record set last time I was there ($139 I think.)  They said the CD set
was on order.  I haven't checked back to see if they got it in or how 
much they are asking for it.  I guess a couple of the mail order companies
no longer have it for sale.  I suppose I should buy myself one before they
become extinct (and before I wear the tape of TWWI and TWWII to shreds!)
Has anyone heard of any low prices recently?
 
Regarding Mouth Music...
        Any Bay Area Love hounds thinking of going to the Mouth Music
concert at VIP in San Jose?  If any of you know anything about VIP (ie
phone number or address) could you drop me a line?
