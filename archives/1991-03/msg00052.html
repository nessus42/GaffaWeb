&gt;Really-From: neff@hp-vcd.vcd.hp.com (Dave Neff)

[reprint from Douglas Pratt's review of TSF]

&gt;let alone a decent 12.  On one, the recording is "live" (there's clapping)
&gt;while the video is of Bush alone in a room.  Dishonest.

Just of curiosity, does this refer to the "Wow" video?  The only "Wow"
I've seen is the one made for "TWS."  I can't imagine it being
"There Goes a Tenner" and the only other video I haven't seen from
TSF is "Them Heavy People."  If it *is* "Wow" then we have proof of the
idiocy of the reviewer--never stopping to figure out what the song is about
before branding the artist as dishonest.


&gt;"Live at the Hamersmith Odeon" is even less satisfying, since she
&gt;doesn't do "Babooshka" (the discs only share three numbers) and there
&gt;are no pieces which stand out.  Bush has a microphone suspended in front
&gt;of her mouth like an orthodontal retainer and generally goes through the
&gt;same costume changes and exaggerated movements ('choreography') that
&gt;she did on her videos.

Hey, boys 'n girls, can you say *innovation*?  I *knew* you could.  God
forbid that a mic should detract from KaTe's beauty in order that people
can hear her *SING* while she dances.


&gt;Oh well, don't be too hard on Douglas Pratt.  After all, he is
&gt;a critic, and he can't be all bad since he liked "Babooshka". :-).  You

Oh, I'm the first to admit that some of those early videos aren't really
my idea of a good time.  I'm not sure what it is that supposedly makes
"Babooshka" all that different from, say, "Wuthering Heights" other than
maybe the costume changes, or the props (sword and bass), or the fact 
that she exposes considerably more of herself in the sword-wielding segments.

On the other hands, her dance routines have a lot more feeling, meaning, and
all around artistic quality then say, oh, gee, I dunno, something by Vanilla
Ice.  It comes down the difference between dancing to look cool and dancing
as a means to interpret emotion into motion.  

Critics.  Pah.

Jeff
