I receieved the Happy Rhodes collection a couple weeks back and I've
been absorbing it slowly.  There are a few songs on the 1st album that are
great (I love every odd song on the first side (1st, 3rd, 5th) but
Given In is my personal favorite (esp. when she says she tries to keep on
top of every one of them)).  Now the thing to note about Ms. Rhodes
aural gratification is that in the high registers she sounds *uncannily*
similar to Ms. Bush.  It is errie.  In the lower registers however
(which, incidentally I tend to prefer...) she is very deep and dark and
brooding and not too much like Kate, who doesn't use those lower 
registers as much as Happy does.  The music also is very much simpler
(acoustic on the first 2 albums almost entirely) which makes it a little
folkier than Kate.  That's ok.  I find myself wishing, though, when
I here the synth stuff that she either would decide to make the
synth sound less plastic, or perhaps have more money to do so...
make you appreciate the fairlight which sounds way less canned and
irritating.  But once again, if you are into hearing Kate Bush-like
vocals (and they are quite authentic, like close your eyes and
you would swear by them), order some happy stuff.   She certainly
is at least as good as alot of the other crap out there.

Interestingly, the little leaflet that comes with the tapes says she is
"reminiscent of Kate Bush and Joni Mitchell", and I can see where 
the Joni Mitchell comparison comes in (the acoustic guitar and the
lower voice registers are Jni-ish, but not as uncanny as the Kate likeness)
the music, is however more brooding than  kate and joni.  I can't think
of a better word.  It does bring to mind at least superficially
diamanda galas.

Now, who is this Kevin Bartlett guy who seems to be the co-artist of
aural grat?

Indigo Girls tonight in Chicago and I am very psyched.
Their new album is arguably stronger than their first (major one,
not strange fire) which was superb too.  Should be a fine show.

Till then.
