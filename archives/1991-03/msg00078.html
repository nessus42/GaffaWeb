WHOOPS.  I forgot to answer one of Vickie's questions.  I used a Cannon Sure
Shot which I bought at Price Club for 120 bucks.  The interesting thing is we
have another similar camera (The Vivitar, I think) for about 70 bucks that has
a zoom lens.  When I got paid before I left for the convention, we were out of
the cheaper camera, so I bought the Cannon.  I was kicking myself at the
Convention, cause right before I left we got in the cheaper camera which might
have had even closer photos.  Fortunately I have learned that the Vivitar
doesn't take as nice of photos, so I guess I made the right decision.  
        The only problem was that they were too white when printed normally,
but that was only on the Kate photos. 
        Also you mentioned how close I was.  I was lucky enough to get a close
seat without having to rudely go in front of people like the people standing
up.  This makes the photos nicer for me, cause I know I didn't have to be rude
to get them. 
        I just got a letter from Ray Russell.  It seems that when he helped me
sort out the photos, on the way back he dropped the axle on his car!! The last
of the photo-curse???  I have just gone over the (hopefully) last major
financial shock wave from the convention and photos, so hopefully this is the
end of the curse.       Also, I had my first Kate-contact (is that the right
word) in more than a year (not counting the convention).  I have been going to
a form of physical therapy called Feldenkrais and while I was having the
therapy being done I saw some Phycological books on the wall so I asked my
physical therapist if she had ever heard of Reich.  She said that she had some
of his books and had done a paper on him.  I later mentioned Kate and she said
"Oh, I heard of her, I have one of her albums."
"Which one" 
"The one with the black and white cover."
"The Whole Story?" 
"Yeah, that's probably it."
"There's a song on there called Cloudbusting which is based on book written by
Peter Reich about his dad."
"Oh, really" 

So anyway, next time I have the therapy she is going to bring in one of his
books and educate me on him and I am going to educate her about Kate....

P.S.  I left an early message to Vickie earlier but don't see it here now.
