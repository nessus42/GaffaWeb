<PRE>
does anybody know where i can find a print of the photo of KaTe on
the back of "the dreaming" single? that one is violated by the ly-
rics.

there is a new interview picdisc out there - it's from the interview
that i posted last summer (did i already mention this? i can't re-
member). i saw two copies of it today at a record show: one for $35
(!) that claimed it was the test pressing and the other for $15. i
haven't decided if it is really worth it yet (i didn't buy either).

still no word on the _passing through air_ cd that ied asked about.
it's been in goldmine a few times with, um, the cd exchange (if mem-
ory serves correctly). i know an english love-hound said he either
bought one or saw one in europe somewhere. there seems to be some
kind of bottleneck getting chapter one releases into the states of
late (the mccartney issues also on that label are not turning up
either).

ron hill: send me your address please. i'm finally going to break
down and buy those pictures, if you still have some left or will 
print more.

ken brownfield: your tapes are done. in the mail tomorrow. i lost
your e-mail address, so drop me a line if you've got questions. the
_tsw_ poster looks nice next to the "tsw" poster. :)

greg bossert: will you be willing to mail printouts of the _tww_ lyric
booklets to those of us without access to a postscript printer? also
thanks for announcing that your house is available for KaTemas. i was
going to, but now i don't have to... :)

kristin hargie: *nobody* listens to wtsc except other deejays. ;)

for those of you who care: laurie anderson's _united states live_ is
now out on cd. four discs. yum! i order mine tomorrow.

has anybody any ideas on what material KaTe would preform should she
go on tour again? it is mine and meredith's feeling that she would
concentrate on stuff *after* _lionheart_, and maybe playing "wuther-
ing heights" for old times sake.. _the ninth wave_ seems a bit too
unwieldly live, but that would be a fantastic experience if she 
could pull it off. 

our new moderator: what machine are the archives now on? and what is
its ip address (you know the funny numbers :) (we're gonna have to fi-
gure out a funny way to type his name like |&gt;oug's...maybe |3ill?).

oh! we got a scanner at work...i might be making more gifs again if i
can figure a way to make it do color. and convert the images. and...

incidentially, the lyrics for "games without frontiers" on the new
(well, recent) peter gabriel compilation were changed from "pissing on
goons in the jungle" to something less "offensive". gads! even peter
is politically correct now...

um, guess that's it for now...
