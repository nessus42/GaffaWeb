Crime-ma-nelly!!

Ever since I started posting to Rec.Music.Gaffa via the Love Hounds 
Mailing list, I have had SPAM problems.  Ick.  I hate SPAM.  
Processed Head Cheese...  

NOW something has happened and the SPAM is comming from the Mailing 
List!!!!  What the heck happened???  I would like it to stop, if 
possible..  What do we have to do?

I would also like to propose the following:

1)  If we continue to post to RMG from LH, can the posts to RMG have 
some sort of SPAM guard on the "reply to" field.  When I post to 
other newsgroups (using Forte Free Agent) I use a simple spam guard.  
 (altered e-mail address that person replying has to edit before 
using.  SPAMBOTS cannot use such an e-mail address - yet)  How 
difficult would it be for the LH-Bot that verifies subscription to LH 
to post to RMG with spam guarded e-mail... I'm not a news group 
expert, but this seems like it SHOULD be doable.

2)  If the above is not possible, could we consider divorcing RMG 
from LH?  the time lag from LH to RMG is at such a period that I 
hardly ever check RMG for postings.  I think that in most cases 
limiting LH to a basic mailing list with exposure from Gaffa Web 
should be sufficent.  It would also eliminate SPAM.  Ick!  I HATE 
SPAM!!!  THEN if one wishes to post to RMG, they could use the normal 
process (with or without spam guard) and when reading the newsgroup, 
can choose to skip the spam.

I had some other ideas, last night when I couldn't sleep from fear of 
SPAM piling up in my mail box... ICK I HATE SPAM (but did I already 
mention that??)

Whadda all think??
