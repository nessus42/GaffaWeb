&gt; 
&gt; &gt;1. Heather (from our mailing list) Russell was performing at a coffee
&gt; &gt;house in Charlotte, NC this last weekend.  I couldn't attend, but my 
&gt; &gt;son
&gt; &gt;Darren who was there held up the phone for a few seconds.  Heather, 
&gt; &gt;from
&gt; &gt;what I could hear and was reinforced by Darren (a tall kid with a 
&gt; &gt;"very"
&gt; &gt;short haircut), you're good! (P.S., he had a painting on the wall 
&gt; &gt;there,
&gt; &gt;two reclining intertwined figures in blue.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;2. While passing through Atlanta today, I noticed that Jane Siberry 
&gt; &gt;will
&gt; &gt;be performing there tomorrow night, Tuesday 09-Sep.  Drat. Timing is
&gt; &gt;wrong for me.  And the way posts are going lately, this will probably
&gt; &gt;be an after the fact notification.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;.                                                        Q___  -- --

&gt; 
&gt; Well, what a treat to be listed in the same title with my idol, Jane!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your comments, Neal - glad your son could make it to the 
&gt; show - chances are I talked to him at some point in the evening.  I had 
&gt; a wonderful time playing at Seven Seeds - very appreciative audience, 
&gt; great staff.  I'll be coming back there late October/November to promote 
&gt; the new CD.
&gt; 
&gt; And what synergy... I GOT TO SEE JANE IN ATLANTA!  For an early birthday 
&gt; present, my boyfriend had me skip work.  He wouldn't tell me why.  We 
&gt; got on I-85 South (from Chapel Hill NC).  When we got to Charlotte (home 
&gt; of my brother) he got on the exit ramp, then back on the highway.  OK, 
&gt; we're not going to Charlotte I guess.  Then a few hours later, he gets 
&gt; on the exit ramp for my parents in Greenville, SC, and back on the 
&gt; highway.  As anyone who lives around there knows, the only logical next 
&gt; guess was Atlanta.  Still don't know *why* until we pulled up at the 
&gt; Village Playhouse in little five points.  The marquee read "Leo Kottke". 
&gt;  As much respect as I have for Mr. Kottke, let's just say it was not the 
&gt; result I was expecting from a 7 hour road trip (especially since he 
&gt; plays our area fairly frequently).
&gt; 
&gt; However, as we drove by to park, I saw that on the *other* side of the 
&gt; marquee was the sign for that night's show - JANE!!
&gt; 
&gt; She was incredible as always.  She had not performed in Atlanta in 9 
&gt; years, and many people in the crowd had seen that last show (for The 
&gt; Walking album.)  It was her, Tim Ray on piano, and Rebecca Campbell on 
&gt; vocals.  She did mostly the newer stuff from Teenager and Maria, with a 
&gt; few "throwbacks", namely Love is Everything from When I Was a Boy, and 
&gt; You Don't Need from No Borders Here.  It would take several posts to 
&gt; describe the concert - truly wonderful.
&gt; 
&gt; I got to talk to her after the show and got her to autograph her "Day in 
&gt; the Life" CD I had just purchased. 
&gt; 
&gt; A wonderful early birthday present...
&gt; 
&gt; Heather
&gt; 
&gt; n.p. Jane (of course!) No Borders Here.
&gt; 
&gt;  P.S.  You can get on her e-mailing list at her website -
