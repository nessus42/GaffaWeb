&gt;1. Heather (from our mailing list) Russell was performing at a coffee
&gt;house in Charlotte, NC this last weekend.  I couldn't attend, but my 
&gt;son
&gt;Darren who was there held up the phone for a few seconds.  Heather, 
&gt;from
&gt;what I could hear and was reinforced by Darren (a tall kid with a 
&gt;"very"
&gt;short haircut), you're good! (P.S., he had a painting on the wall 
&gt;there,
&gt;two reclining intertwined figures in blue.)

&gt;2. While passing through Atlanta today, I noticed that Jane Siberry 
&gt;will
&gt;be performing there tomorrow night, Tuesday 09-Sep.  Drat. Timing is
&gt;wrong for me.  And the way posts are going lately, this will probably
&gt;be an after the fact notification.

Well, what a treat to be listed in the same title with my idol, Jane!

Thanks for your comments, Neal - glad your son could make it to the 
show - chances are I talked to him at some point in the evening.  I had 
a wonderful time playing at Seven Seeds - very appreciative audience, 
great staff.  I'll be coming back there late October/November to promote 
the new CD.

And what synergy... I GOT TO SEE JANE IN ATLANTA!  For an early birthday 
present, my boyfriend had me skip work.  He wouldn't tell me why.  We 
got on I-85 South (from Chapel Hill NC).  When we got to Charlotte (home 
of my brother) he got on the exit ramp, then back on the highway.  OK, 
we're not going to Charlotte I guess.  Then a few hours later, he gets 
on the exit ramp for my parents in Greenville, SC, and back on the 
highway.  As anyone who lives around there knows, the only logical next 
guess was Atlanta.  Still don't know *why* until we pulled up at the 
Village Playhouse in little five points.  The marquee read "Leo Kottke". 
 As much respect as I have for Mr. Kottke, let's just say it was not the 
result I was expecting from a 7 hour road trip (especially since he 
plays our area fairly frequently).

However, as we drove by to park, I saw that on the *other* side of the 
marquee was the sign for that night's show - JANE!!

She was incredible as always.  She had not performed in Atlanta in 9 
years, and many people in the crowd had seen that last show (for The 
Walking album.)  It was her, Tim Ray on piano, and Rebecca Campbell on 
vocals.  She did mostly the newer stuff from Teenager and Maria, with a 
few "throwbacks", namely Love is Everything from When I Was a Boy, and 
You Don't Need from No Borders Here.  It would take several posts to 
describe the concert - truly wonderful.

I got to talk to her after the show and got her to autograph her "Day in 
the Life" CD I had just purchased. 

A wonderful early birthday present...

Heather

n.p. Jane (of course!) No Borders Here.

 P.S.  You can get on her e-mailing list at her website -
