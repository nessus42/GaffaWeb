&gt;There you have it.  This CD is utter crap.  It garbage....garbage that even
&gt;maggots wouldn't touch.   
&gt;
&gt;I feel soooo ashamed to have spent money on this.  It's not worth it at all.
&gt;
&gt;on a scale of 1 to 10,  I rate it a 0.
&gt;
&gt;I know some of you are curious about this CD...but don't buy it.  If
&gt;you absolutely MUST here this sh*t, then email me privately, I'll tape 
&gt;it for you.  I don't want other people to waste their money on this bootleg.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Whoever made this CD has no class whatsoever.
&gt;
&gt;Kate's songs here are defaced, raped and literally destroyed.   
&gt;
&gt;I hope a warning goes out in the next Homeground issue....
&gt;
&gt;*sigh*

I for one have never heard the original Early Years tape.  I have only
heard the Organic Acid tape mentioned above so I don't know what the Early
Years tape should sound like. 
I would very much like to hear them but noone in this group seems to want
to get a few people together to make copies to circulate amongst all of us.
 I've only read about a few having this tape and in an earlier post, the
first thing in the message read, DO NOT ASK FOR A COPY. Most of us have
only read about how wonderful these tapes are and have no way of hearing them.
Are there any love-hounds out there willing to start making decent copies
of the original Early Years tape to circulate amongst us? 
I am willing to do whatever I can to help.
