&gt;Ok, this is a true story.  Disturbing, but true.
&gt;
&gt;Last week I was killing time at work, I mean having a meeting at work, with
&gt;a co-worker and the subject of music and Kate came up.  My co-worker was
&gt;not familiar with Kate so I thought - "Here is my chance to do some
&gt;missionary work!"  The next day I brought in "The Line, the Cross &amp; the
&gt;Curve" for her to see.  At lunch she took it into the conference room (we
&gt;have a TV-VCR in there) and I went out to get some lunch.
&gt;
&gt;I got back and was eating at my desk when she came into my office with the
&gt;tape, looked at me and said, "Artists!" , rolled her eyes and left.  Well,
&gt;I was dumbfounded.

   Was she referring to Kate? Or are you an artist?

&gt;When I could manage to get up from my chair I went to her office to try to
&gt;talk to her.  She then tried to get me to listen to The Violent Femmes. 
&gt;(They sounded like the Ramones hopped up on estrogen to me.)  I haven't
&gt;talked to here since.

   Before I try to interest anyone in Kate, I try to have a pretty good
handle on what other artists they like. Then you can carefully pick
an appropriate song. 

&gt;Anyone else had a terrible experience like this?  I mean, I tried! 

   Actually I rarely expect anyone else to "get" Kate. I discovered
her music in 1979 on Saturday Night Live. All the other people I knew
who saw it just thought she was "weird"; some thought she was drunk.
I, in the other hand, *had* to go out to get her album the very next
day. So I never expected anyone else to understand. I found my 
girlfriend Vickie (we've been together for 15 years) via an ad
in a music paper trying to locate other Kate fans.

&gt;Ken
&gt;
&gt;P.S. Over in alt.music.pink-floyd they were having a discussion about
&gt;whether Kate and Dave Gilmour had/are having an affair.  Some of you want
&gt;to go straighten those heathens out?

   I'm aware of the discussion (I have a service that mails me every
post where the words "Kate" and "Bush" appear together). As they refer
to Guilmor as "...that fat bastard" I didn't relish jumping in.

   It's not true, BTW. It's a sexist assumption by people unable to
imagine that any woman could succeed solely on her talents.
