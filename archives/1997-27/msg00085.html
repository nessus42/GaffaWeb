I don't even try anymore to get my friends into Kate.  I've never had one
successful attempt.  I think maybe she is something that a person has to
discover on his or her own (i.e. like on a various artist CD as I discovered
her -Greenpeace- or in She's Having a Baby as someone I know discovered her).
 Maybe she's too much for people to handle initially in a strong dose like a
full CD or a video.  I usually get the "she's too weird" attitude.  If the
music is "weird" her video interpretations must seem even weirder to the
Kate-deprived person, so maybe that was your mistake :)  Maybe one day Kate
and Violent Femmes will end up on the same various artist CD and your friend
will discover our fabulous Kate herself ;)

 Ok, this is a true story.  Disturbing, but true.
 
 Last week I was killing time at work, I mean having a meeting at work, with
 a co-worker and the subject of music and Kate came up.  My co-worker was
 not familiar with Kate so I thought - "Here is my chance to do some
 missionary work!"  The next day I brought in "The Line, the Cross &amp; the
 Curve" for her to see.  At lunch she took it into the conference room (we
 have a TV-VCR in there) and I went out to get some lunch.
 
 I got back and was eating at my desk when she came into my office with the
 tape, looked at me and said, "Artists!" , rolled her eyes and left.  Well,
 I was dumbfounded.
 
 When I could manage to get up from my chair I went to her office to try to
 talk to her.  She then tried to get me to listen to The Violent Femmes. 
 (They sounded like the Ramones hopped up on estrogen to me.)  I haven't
 talked to here since.
 
 Anyone else had a terrible experience like this?  I mean, I tried! 
 
 Ken
 
 P.S. Over in alt.music.pink-floyd they were having a discussion about
 whether Kate and Dave Gilmour had/are having an affair.  Some of you want
 to go straighten those heathens out?
