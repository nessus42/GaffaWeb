If you throw Mother Theresa into the equation, there should have been
hundreds of state funerals, drowning out the insipid nature of the
mass shock and horror following Diana's death. I can find very little
in Diana that made her worthy of the outpouring--other than that she
was a symbol. What was she a symbol of? Someone who was above average
in beauty and grace who married a prince that was already a
laughing-stock. I daresay that, if the Queen (God forbid this should
happen) left this world tonight, England would be stuck with a
tragically goofy figurehead that chose his wife badly, and then, in
many ways, abandoned his decision. 

How can anybody still be talking about Diana? Where she was a
store-bought figuring of soft pastic, Mother Theresa, no matter what
religion or irreligion you might follow, was the real thing. Where
Diana got tired of playing a barbie doll (oh the hardships she must
have endured) , Mother Theresa gave every day for what amounted to 10
times the duration of Diana's stint as a Princess.

I do feel the loss for Diana's children, and those that misguidedly
took her as some sort of roll model. I do think it was tragic that 3
people lost their lives in such a brutal way, but let's not waste so
much time on building emototional monuments to the loss of someone who
owed our knowledge of her to luck--plain, dumb, LUCK.

&gt;The wisdom of Kate's conscious decision to avoid the media and not to become
&gt;just another celebrity is now apparent.  See where Princess Diana's thirst for 
&gt;celebrity got her.  Now she's dead.  I find it very interesting the
&gt;relationship of 
&gt;talent and brilliance to who is meritorious of celebrity and how this has
&gt;worked in
&gt;Kate's favor.  Princess Diana, who was a relatively talentless cutesy
&gt;air-head and
&gt;a former member of the Royal family, is admired and mourned by millions;
&gt;yet, Kate Bush, who has given the world more than Diana ever thought of, is
&gt;relatively
&gt;ignored.  Brilliance is ignored while mediocrty is Glorified!  Ain't the
&gt;world a twisted place.  I hope I never live to see Kate Bush's death, but
&gt;when than time comes, she definitely deserves a state funeral.  Kate has
&gt;character that Diana only wished she had.
