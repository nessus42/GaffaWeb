Greetings Lovehounds,

   Boy, this latest episode really stirred up a lot of thoughts and
emotions.  Ther are a couple of things that I'd like share:

1.  bootlegs are bootlegs....  sometimes they're interesting, sometimes
    they're not.   For me personally, that latter applies to the Organic
    Acid CD that I recently bought.  Some of you might actually like the
    CD.  I don't have a problem with that.  Everyone's entitled to their
    opinion.   However, I do question anybody who would say that they
    enjoy the versions of "Passing throuh Air", "Dreamtime" and "The
    Handsome Cabin Boy" that are on the CD.   The same applies to the
    demos that were "enhanced".  I know the demos are sought after.  I
    can dub you all the "real" demos that I have free of charge, email
    me privately.  As far as the "Katetopia (Fruitopia Song Collage)"
    is concerned, I really don't like what was done here.  I never was
    one to enjoy "DJ" or "DJesque" remixes of songs.  In this case, the
    mix itself is quite amateurish.  But if it weren't for the fact that the
    bootlegger delibrately choose "Katetopia" as the title and the fact 
    that Kate's interview responses are stuck all over the place, the 
    collage MIGHT....be acceptable.    "Katetopia" is a lovehounds
    product.  It's unfair to have bootleggers associate their product
    with ours.  "Katetopia" was made in the best spirit of this mailinglist
    and newsgroup.  It WASN'T made to make any profit whatsoever.   It's 
    there for all to share.   

2.  I agree with Chris Williams when he says that if Kate isn't making 
    any money on the demos (of any other music), noone should.   As fans,
    we are always searching for new material to love and share...and as
    much as I hate to say this, bootleggers often play an important role 
    in providing us with "rare" material....good or bad.  

3.  Thank you to all who supported my "venomous" views.  Your faith in me
    is very refreshing.  :-)     IED and Karen have even suggested that
    I get my money back.  Again, thanks for the support but I'd decline any
    such offer from Mark.  He didn't force me to buy the CD...what he did was
    misinform me of the contents of the CD.  I NEVER would've bought this CD if
    I had known that the songs were "doctored".   What I would like to see 
    though is that whoever out there paid more than $30.00 should get a refund 
    for the difference.   Mark has been offering this CD for $40.00 to other
    people.    It's not worth it...but I CAN understand someone acquiring it
    to add to his or her collection.  That's why I bought it in the first 
    place...plus the fact that the CD contains a couple of new demos...I too
    am curious about them. 
     
    I'm also offering to tape this CD free of charge.  All I need is a blank
    60 minute tape and a self addressed stamped return return envelope.  
    (email me for details).

    Mark, perhaps you can offer the same service???
      
4.  As Chris Williams said,  the sound quality of tapetree diminishes
    considerably after about 3 generations.  If we're to set up a tapetree
    to share the newly found demos, The Magician of Lublin and the other
    demos,  then I think great care should be put in the tree structure
    so that any "leaf" is no more than 2 gens. away from a master tape.
    The tree could be set up as follows:
        - The masters could be those who have the CD.   
        - The branches could be people who have a DAT machine and are
          capable of dubbing onto regular cassettes.  If this is
          not possible, then a regular cassette Branch is OK as long as 
          branch's source tape is of the highest quality.  
    Of course, all this is dependant on volunteers who actually have
    the proper equipement.   I would be willing to setup and manage such a
    tapetree  (but I don't have a DAT) 


peace

ron
