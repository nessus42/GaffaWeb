&gt; 	has anyone ever heard of any connection with K. Bush and the
&gt; "hands-free" headset microphone? maybe that she was the first to use
&gt; them in a performance, perhaps? She didn't play a role in inventing them
&gt; , did she?

&gt;From "Cloudbusting", a compilation by Ron Hill (available on Gaffaweb, I
believe):

&gt;         HOW COMPLICATED HAS THE SOUND BEEN FOR THE TOUR?
&gt;         ENGINEER: Ah, very complicated actually.   [INAUDIBLE]  Mainly the
&gt; miking up of Kate herself, um, from the dance point of view.
&gt; 
&gt;         HOW HAVE YOU SOLVED THAT?
&gt;         ENGINEER: With a very small microphone!  Small mike on a boom arm,
&gt; its gotta be used from the side of her head.   
&gt; 
&gt;         The most difficult ones are where I've got the headset and I'm
&gt; moving a lot.  It's an amazing feeling of freedom, because, like,
&gt; there's nothing in your hands yet you can hear your voice being
&gt; projected miles away - it's incredible.  But it's not quite in it's
&gt; full design yet.  There are just a few things that are wrong with it.
&gt; And it's not always right in front of my mouth, but we're getting that
&gt; seen to.
&gt; (1979, Kate Bush On Tour)

&gt;         What I needed was a microphone that I didn't have to hold, because
&gt; we wanted to do dance that involved two other dancers so I could be
&gt; lifted and we could run across the stage, and holding a microphone was
&gt; very inhibiting.  So the sound guy that we had for the tour, I said to
&gt; him `I want you to invent a microphone for me that I don't have to
&gt; carry'.  So he basically invented the radio mikes that you see now,
&gt; that he made it out of a coat hanger.  So he got an old coat hanger and
&gt; kind of bent it into shape here, and then had this piece that came
&gt; round here, that the microphone was then put on so it was just in
&gt; front of the mouth.  (1989, VH-1)


Hope that helps.
