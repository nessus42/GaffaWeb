Working in the middle of nowhere I have not yet had the chance to buy
the new single and so have to resort to sending information about odd
Kate references. Not sure if this is what Meredith had in mind when she
referred to Kate spin-offs.

In last week's Canned Carrot programme on BBC-1 Brummie comedian
Jasper Carrot did a routine in which he mentioned Kate Bush. The
reference was to her having recorded an album with whales on it and
various "jokes" about getting whales into the studio. As well as being
notably unfunny (which is unusual as Carrot's material is normally
well-written) it was inaccurate - I believe it was Judy Collins who recorded
an album which featured whale sounds prominently.

The latest issue of BA's magazine for air-travellers (High Flyer) reveals
that Wuthering Heights (from The Whole Story) is one of the featured
tracks on channel 3 of Skysound. There is a small colour picture of Kate
as well.

There is an A4 size advert for Rocket Man in this week's NME, featuring
what I assume is the picture from the sleeve. It states that Candle in the Wind
is a brand new recording exclusive to this release.

The single itself is reviewed by some spotty adolescents called St. Etienne
(hope their music is better than their football). There is a small B&amp;W
photo with the caption "Bush whacked" (gosh that's original!).
The "review" is:
"St. Etienne all agree Kate is the empress of ethereal sex-pop and profess
a deep love for Elton's original, but her ill-advised decision to croon
breathily over an abysmal "reggae" arrangement causes widespread projectile
vomiting within a five-mile radius.
B: It's the Goombay Dance Band influence. Cod reggae. It should sound like
space, she could have done something really interesting with it.
P: It's better than 'Wuthering Heights' ... no it's not."

This was the first time I have bought a British music weekly for almost a
year. It will probably be longer before I buy my next copy!

Amnesty International are producing a 30th anniversary celebration to
be broadcast on ITV on Dec. 28th. So far Kate is not billed to appear
but Dave Gilmour is on the list so it is just possible Kate might make
an appearance.

Be seeing you,
	Neil
