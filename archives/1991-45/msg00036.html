&gt;Melissa, you have the empathy and compassion of a double-edged razor

razor!  Make me buy KaTe rarities I can't afford!

Vickie your propensity for name calling speaks volumes about you.

 OK Vickie *I* was also an abused child.  Now explain to me the `ungodly
risk` I just took.  That's right, none.  It's over and done with.  My
life goes on.
 
What's the bottom line on the problem you are having with Missy here
Vickie?  The fact that she is actually willing to stand up and assume
responsibility for who she is and not pass the buck off onto someone or
something else or something that happend in her past?  I know Missy's
accepting responsibility for herself is not fashionable but I think it's
wonderful.  It's real easy to blame your shortcomings, inability to make
decisions or your screwed up life on events or pressures (past and or
present) exerted on you by your parents, the church, government, job or
whatever, but it's something else entirely to _grow_up_ and take
responsible for your own life.  I think your attacks on Missy is way out
of line.  In my book if _some_ of your opinions were worth a 5th of what
you apparently think they are worth you would never again have a problem
with the phone company, hell you would own it.
