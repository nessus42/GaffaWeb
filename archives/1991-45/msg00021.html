&gt;Hi all!  Well, this  is a bit of a potporri.  

&gt;First, the latest music news in Orlando.

&gt;It seems last Monday, at a downtown "progressive, underground
&gt;punk" club called Club Space Fish, a group known as GG Wells
GG Allin
&gt;and the Murder Junkies, proceeded to urinate and defacate
&gt;onstage, and then began throwing the ... poo poo at the
&gt;audience.  They were arrested, the club was temporarily shut
&gt;down.   Apparently, in 1989, the same guys were arrested in
&gt;Dallas for the same type thing.  THe news had a video snippet.
Apparently he has threatend to kill himself on stage on Oct 31st
next year taking as many of the audience with hime as possible.
I find this quite interesting relating to cencorship - after all if
he did so would he be guilty of murder, or manslaughter? If it
was known in advance he was going to chuck crap at people, or try
to kill them &amp; they turned up, can they complain.
Could they sue him if he didn't kill himself? :-)
And more importantly would it be a loss to the world? Just think -
a great artist like that commiting suicide :-)

&gt;It was very nice.   One of the band members claimed that his
&gt;body was atemple, and all his fluids were sacred. 
&gt;Neat.  I'm so glad I was doing laundry instead.
