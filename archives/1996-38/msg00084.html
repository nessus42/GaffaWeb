I sent a post a few days ago, but I didn't see it on the list.  So, I am
writing again.  First of all, someone asked if Kate steals from Tori.
Well, I love both women, and I have been into Tori a lot longer than Kate.
However, if one woman has stolen from the other (and I think the idea is
ludicrous to begin with), it would have to be Tori from Kate.  Kate was
making music long before Tori, and her albums and singles reached the
public long before the first of Tori's.  Now, on to my questions.

1. what Kate Books do you people own, and which would you recommend?  Does
   anyone have KATE BUSH COMPLETE or KATE BUSH: A VISUAL DOCUMENTARY?

2. what videos are on THE WHOLE STORY video that are not on THE SINGLE FILE

3. are there cool liner notes in THE WHOLE STORY album

I have all of Kate's albums of original material, but have yet to get THE
WHOLE STORY.  I have THE SINGLE FILE video, but no other videos.  I am in
love with this woman and I wish to God that I had discovered her years
ago.  Now nineteen, I feel that I am just too far behind the times!  The
reason I got into the goddess is that I saw a letter in REQUEST from a
woman who claimed that Tori Amos has ripped of Kate Bush and should take
be taken to court for the crime!  I was intrigued and decided to explore
Kate.  If the letter was written by one of you, please let me know, so that
I can thank you for turning me onto Kate.  I still love Tori, too, and I
don't know if we are "allowed" to mention her on this list.  Please respond
someone.

shane, with thanks
