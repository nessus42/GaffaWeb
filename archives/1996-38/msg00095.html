Hi there everyone,

I've been reading this newsgroup for nearly three weeks now (that is,
when it is getting any postings at all :)), and I felt I ought to
chip-in at last with my five-eggs-worth.

I also am a huge fan of KB. During my early teenage years she was a
huge influence on the way I looked at life in general and I doubt very
much if my character today would be the same if she were not part of
my make-up. (For anyone who is even remotely interested, my first
music loves were KB, Mike Oldfield, Tangerine Dream, YES and JM
Jarre).

I have followed her career avidly since even before her first single
hit the UK charts. I remember the earliest time was the late Summer of
1977 when I met my first true girlfriend and we fell in love , which
just happened to be the first time I heard Kate's "Wuthering Heights".


Over the last few years with pressures of work and a struggling
marriage (I'm now 30 incidentally) I've lost touch with my true faith
in KB and it has brought deep emotions back to the fore when I've read
some of your equally devoted testimonials to her.

The one thing that I have noticed when those of you who are interested
in collecting all things KB, is that I haven't seen anyone mention one
of the earliest (if not THE earliest) written publication dedicated to
her.

I am talking of course about the book "The secret history of KATE BUSH
(&amp; the strange art of pop)" written by the equally enigmatic and
besotten Frank Vermorel.

This wonderful book, published in 1983,  full of beautiful pictures of
Kate from her early teenage years to the time when she launched "The
Dreaming" and in-depth research into her family's intrigueing past is
an absolute must. 

Oh dear, I'm falling in love with her all over again.
