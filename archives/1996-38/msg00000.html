Note:  I tried sending this yesterday but I keep getting messages saying
that it didn't go through and will keep trying.  So I apologize if it
appears twice here.

&gt; &gt; P.S.  Back in 1986 I heard "Jif of LIfe" on the BBC, but without any
&gt; &gt; singing.  It was a different arrangement and the broadcaster said the song
&gt; &gt; was an old tune unearthed by one Paddy Bush.  Does anyone know more about
&gt; &gt; this?
&gt;
&gt;This is fascinating, the first IED has ever heard of such a broadcast.  Do
&gt;you remember whether Paddy was a guest on the programme?  What was the
&gt;context of the piece being aired?
&gt;
&gt;At the Romford KT Convention (October 1985) Paddy said that the source for
&gt;the rhythm and bass-drone sounds from the "jig" sections of "Jig of Life"
&gt;were inspired by a tape he had made of a performance he had himself witnessed
&gt;of a "Greek or Macedonian fire dance" (if IED remembers correctly).  He has
&gt;never heard anything else about such a thing, however.  Anyone?

The broadcast was heard from Vancouver, B.C. on the folk music program.  I
had just tuned in a few minutes before getting home.  I caught some of the
tune and then "Jig of Life" ended as I pulled into the driveway and all I
heard was the Paddy Bush credit at the end.  I'm unsure if he was a guest
or not on the program.  What I distinctly recall was that it WAS an
instrumental version of "Jig of Life" and Paddy's name being mentioned in
some context of discovering the tune.  I wish I could recall more.
