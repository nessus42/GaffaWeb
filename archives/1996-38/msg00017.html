Just two short bits  ...

On Monday night on 2fm the national Irish music station , the lead 
singer of Dublin band The Wild Oscars was selecting his favourite 
tracks on the Moloney After Midnight programme . Lesley Keyes asked 
Mike Moloney to play Deeper Understanding as one of his all time 
favourites . He mentioned that the song (and album ) had taken a long 
time to get into but that it had helped him to get through some bad 
times . The song made him rush out and buy all of Kates prior 
releases.... Mike Moloney commented after the track was played that he 
had a "fragmentary" relationship with Kates' music and a conversation 
ensued about how it was about 20 years since Kate got the EMI advance 
and of how extraordinary their faith in her was at the time .
I haven't heard much of this band but they are currently plugging 
their new album "Fish" and play Dublin on Sunday night ...might check 
them out !!!

Also last night (Wednesday) on RTE 1 television , in the programme 
Planet Rock Profiles , Dave Fanning was interviewing Suede about 
their new album Coming Up .Dave mentioned to lead singer Brett 
Anderson that It was strange that the influences on his sound ranged 
from Crass to Kate Bush . Brett acknowledged a big influence from 
Kate and sought to emulate her in his work !!!

That's all ...

Sean :-)
