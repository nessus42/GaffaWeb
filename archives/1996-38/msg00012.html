&gt;(I got behind on reading this newsgroup's posts a few weeks back due to work,
&gt;and am slowly swimming upstream.  Did a recent post REALLY ask if love-hounds
&gt;was active? Anyway, the headwaters are almost within sight now!)

Time to spawn.  calloo callay!

and bama handed arkansas their heads!  And Tennessee and Auburn lost
theirs.  A good weekend.  Now if kitchens would just stop tossing
high....

&gt; if someone will buy the billboard space,
&gt; I'll contribute a few bucks!  Would probably get better results than toilet-
&gt; papering her house, anyway (American custom for showing affection).

Might not be as much fun, but we could avoid climbing that evil looking 
gate at east wickham... although tossing rocks at her window has a 
certain allure...  there is quite a bit of wire strung that we can 
toss the rolls over and all the bushes we need out back.  Hmm, the
fence?   Compressed air cannons?  MondoSling shots?  It can be done if
enough 
of us can get to england at the same time. ;-)

Sort of the British invasion in reverse.  BonkersAmericans across the
waters.

More interest than I thought.  A few americans are willing to
contribute.  Anyone in Kent willing to find out what a billboard would
cost?  Surely 
there is a British Lovehound willing to take up the cause of the
rebellion?  Just for giggles.. what would it cost?

Yes, it's an insane idea.  I like it.  Take it to the streets.  Make
posters and put them in all the public transit stations.  Cajole radio
disk
jockeys into repeating the Mantra (Kate Must Tour!) on the air.  Put
helium
balloons  with the message into the skies over London.  Go into
restaurants and
pubs and leave fliers on tables all over Kent.  Hang them inside public
restrooms on
the backs of doors.  TV is too expensive unless someone knows someone in
the 
British Comedy royalty who likes a good roust.  We could call the fellow 
at Virgin Airways and see if he will paint it on a 747.  Ideas?

but a billboard outside her home somewhere would be a good start.

ya gotta be a little crazy. what's she gonna do?  fire us?
