Hi Kelley!

&gt; Hi Uli--as predicted, the TKI w/pink leotard cover showed up
&gt; again, so I bought it.  It is an EMI release, and has this
&gt; code no. on the front under the title: TOCP-6460.

Wow! That's indeed a Japanese catalog number. And it's the exact catalog number that appears on the TKI CD that's in the Japanese This Woman's Work boxed set. But that CD, insert and booklet clearly say "Made in Japan".
The other CDP number is in the boxed set version as well. It's the regular
international catalog number from EMI. Is the CD tray in the jewel case
white? For the boxed set ones is. Another thing that distinguishes the
Japanese TWW issues is a small circled "1" on one of the spines - is it
there? Is there any Kanji writing there? On the back of the Japanese TWW
one there's "KATE BUSH BOX (1)" as well. So the TWW ones are clearly
distinguishable, at least the Japanese ones.

I do not know any regular Japanese TKI CD, only the boxed set one, so I don't
know the catalog number of it. You should ask on love-hounds. Your CD
definitely looks like a German-Japanese collaboration. Maybe someone with a
regular Japanese CD can help.

&gt; On the back it says Manufactured in West Germany, and has the
&gt; same playlist and 1978 date as the US TKI I have.  It has the
&gt; credits on the back, too (they are inside on my US disk).

Credits are on the outside of European issues normally. Not on the Japanese
TWW edition.

&gt; The photo credit is Jay Myrdal
&gt; There is another code number: CDP 7 46012 2.  I don't know if
&gt; that helps. I don't know yet what photos etc. might be inside--
&gt; I didn't take off the shrink wrap yet because I don't know
&gt; if I'll keep it--I really like the picture but if some love-hound wants
&gt; to trade me a video for it, or if it really is rare and worth
&gt; something to collectors, I'll possibly part with it!

I wouldn't say it's that rare. It's just a strange combination between a Japanese and a German release. If you don't find anyone else, I'll take it.
If you find someone else, fine with me. If that someone doesn't care, ask
him to allow you to open the shrinkwrap ;-)

&gt; Thought I'd check with you before "advertising," --you get first
&gt; choice.

Thanks! I pull back for any other taker, but I'll take it if noone else
wants it.

&gt; Did you find this release there in Germany?
&gt; Since it says "West Germany" that means it it isn't a recent
&gt; re-release, correct?

Geee - you're thinking quicker than me. Of course not. It has to *older* than the This Woman's Work boxed set which is from late 1990. German reunion took place on October 3rd 1990.

Bye,

Uli

P.S.: You should forward this email to love-hounds.
