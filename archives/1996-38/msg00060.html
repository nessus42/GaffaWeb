        Well I, for one, have reached my particular limit on how much I'd   
        pay for such an old piece of film of Kate.  5 minutes of Kate       
        probably saying the same thing we've all heard 23 times during that 
        timeframe is not worth it to me.  But is that snippet live, ay? :) 
     
     err..yes it is live. She was interviewed on local TV. The Hammer 
     Horror clip is live too, having been sung on the 'Bill and Boyd' show.
     
     
       God, I feel so old sometimes. :) I used to have such a enthusiasm    
       for *anything* even remotely Kate-related.  But, I think you're      
       asking for trouble doing this. 
          
     I sympathise, however I'm still doing penance for missing the show in 
     1978.
     
          
      &gt;&gt;&gt; These tapes are 'for personal viewing only'. This means that if I
        was the sole purchaser of a copy I would not be able to make it
        available to the LH collection. &lt;&lt;&lt;
     
        HA HA HA!  Good luck. You'd better not make it available to anyone, 
        if these so-called rights owners should hold you accountable.
     
     A good reason to get as many in on the scheme as possible - no one's 
     accountable to me, and seeing as I would never make my copy available 
     to anyone, if a copy did make it to the LH collection they would have 
     no reason to hold me accountable.
     
          
     
        Rhys, while I admire your dediKaTion, I think you're starting       
        something that might come back to haunt you.  And this talk of      
        putting up a billboard to remind Kate. Hey man, it's a waste! Call  
        me a burned-out-from-waiting old fuddy-duddy (god I can't believe I 
        just called myself that), but I think Kate would consider you mad   
        for doing such a thing.  
     
     Being considered mad by Kate would be Kompliment.
     
        She really IS, you know, but she never will. Tour again, that is.
     
     Well, OK - but another promotional trip would be nice ;-)
