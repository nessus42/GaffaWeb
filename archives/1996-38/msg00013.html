Comments from the peanut gallery....

    To be honest I find myself a little irritated by people who must take too
    close a look at an artist's style, talent or personal preferences.

And Len Bullard wrote:

    I find myself irritated by people who won't let me have the pleasure of my
    own irritations. 

My comments - 

Ya know, with a little genetic manipulation you both could be producing pearls.
But if you were both oysters, would len be masochistic for enjoying "... the
pleasure of my own irritations."?

Then Ken wrote

    So what if Kate doesn't want to tour. So, she changed the way she sings a
    song. I'm lucky enough to be able to have seven of Kate's albums in my car,
    and I listen to them almost every day, in order from the old to new.

What I want to know is where you got a turntable that doesn't skip when you hit
potholes.  Oh wait, does your car run?  If it doesn't run, you don't have to
worry about skipping the needle across the vinyl.

[Note to younger readers:  In ages past, artists distributed their recordings of
audio material via pressed vinyl disks which had a set of encoded grooves.  The
information on these grooves could be decoded by running a needle through the
groove and then amplifying the signal.  Sorry about the archaic references.]

Len typed:

    Keep accepting less and expecting less and you will get less.

Cool!  A new weight loss plan!  Get back, I thought of it first...

Len again wrote:

    Or we could take up a collection and buy billboard space on the route from
    her home to Abbey Road that says "KATE TOUR NOW SO BULLARD WILL SHUT UP!!".

... if we're taking up a collection, I've got some socks and old pants to 
contribute along with an old couch.  Who's got a truck?

So I'm poking fun... no offense intended towards either of these fine Net 
citizens, just being irreverent.
