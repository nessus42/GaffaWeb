&gt;         I don't know, but it's not where Kate got the title of the song. 
&gt; 
&gt;         The song is not about, as many think, Hammer Horror films.  It is 
&gt; about an actor and his friend.  His friend is playing the lead in a 
&gt; production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, a part he's been reading all his 
&gt; lfe, waiting for the chance to play it.  He's finally got the big break he's 
&gt; always wanted, and he is the star.  After many rehearsals he dies 
&gt; accidentally, and the friend is asked to take the role over, which, because 
&gt; his own career is at stake, he does.  The dead man comes back to haunt him 
&gt; because he doesn't want him to have the part, believing he's taken away the 
&gt; only chance he ever wanted in life.  And the actor is saying, "Leave me 
&gt; alone, because it wasn't my fault - I have to take this part, but I'm 
&gt; wondering if it's the right thing to do because the ghost is not going to 
&gt; leave me alone and is really freaking me out.  Every time I look round a 
&gt; corner he's there, he never disappears."  (1979, KBC 3)

Before I'd heard Kate explain the meaning of the song, I interpreted it 
to mean that the actor was killed by his friend, and that was the reason 
for the "haunting".  It still works for me...
