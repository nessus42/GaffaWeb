first of all, welcome back to ied.  i thought that perhaps
you were getting absorbed in your thesis, but i should've
known better--a wedding is a Much more noble excuse.  

RUTH was playing in my office when a coworker walked in (the only 
song he recognized, ofcourse), and he asked what the song was about.  
he wondered why she wanted to swap places with god, and indeed that's 
what i thought the interpretation was until i actually read the tiny 
print on the cassette insert.  it seems she wants god to swap places 
with her _and someone else_.  probably an ex-lover, who she's trying to
convince that she's unharmed ( "do you want to know that it doesn't 
hurt me").   but why she would want to swap places with him (?) is
a puzzle--and that she'd somehow be _stronger_ if she did ("be
running up that hill with no problems").  and the symbolism of
going uphill--usually this is used to express progress.  and
_running_ up a hill implies even more drive and determination yet.
but why would she need to swap places with the object to be able to 
_run_ up a hill?  is the object somehow stronger, more immune to weakness?
sorry if this song's too trivial to analyze (in the face of the 9th
wave).     %^)

other notes:  i have now viewed my special video gift from a very
special frIEnD several times now.  i must say, that breathing piano
solo is something to behold.  i had the pleasure of sharing this
with ant in chicago, whom i had the happy opportunity to meet wednesday
night while he was in town (hi ant!).  he ofcourse, agreed.

modern woman with a pleasant attitude,
