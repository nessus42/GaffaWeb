&gt;         . . .  Diaries are for the private perusal of the person
&gt; who writes them.  Private phone calls are for the ears of the
&gt; two people involved.  These tapes were made to show off Kate's skill,
&gt; and were for the perusal of anyone who might be interested in offering
&gt; her a contract.  They were intended for the ears of people who didn't
&gt; know Kate, and who would possibly not listen to them with a kind ear.
&gt; They are not 'private.'

Nor are they 'public'.  The tapes were intended originally for a very
specific audience -- record company execs.  Are you one?  If not, then
Kate has not granted you permission to even *listen* to these tapes,
let alone own bootleg copies of them.  Do the artist's wishes mean
absolutely *nothing* to you people?

&gt; I'm sick of hearing this line about them being like childhood diaries.
&gt; It's bullshit.

So are all the defenses of IED's piracy campaign that I've heard so far.
You folks just hate to even *consider* the possibility that what you're
doing is flat-out morally *wrong*, don't you?
