This is my first posting to this newsgroup -- let's see if my newsreader
can handle it...

In article &lt;1211.3.2925.1&gt; James G Britt writes:

&gt; I like minimalist 
&gt; music. However, the only composers I
&gt; know are Glass, Reich and Reilly.
&gt; Could anybody let me know of some
&gt; other composers and/or works?
&gt;        Thank you!
&gt;            James 

One you probably haven't heard yet is David Borden. Let me quote from his
liner notes:

	...Incidentally, my own approach to repetative structures
	was influenced by Terry Riley's _In C_, NOT Steve Reich
	and Phil Glass as has been widely assumed by critics
	and audiences alike. I met both Steve and Phil in 1970
	and was encouraged by their wonderful work. I think they
	were surprised to find that my work was so stylistically
	close to theirs at that time. The main difference was in
	sound was that mine was a synthesizer ensemble (Mother 
	Mallard, formed in 1968)...

He has at least three albums out:

	_Music for Amplified Keyboard Instruments_ on Red Records
	_Migration_ on Cuneiform
	_The Continuing Story of Counterpoint, Parts 9-12_ on
		Cuneiform

All these records contain parts of his extended work "The Continuing 
Story of Counterpoint".
