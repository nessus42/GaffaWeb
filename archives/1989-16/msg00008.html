I thought I'd post this article I came across a while back in rec.arts.movies,
regarding artistic interpretation, as a counter-point to IED's insistance that
we accept KaTe's interpretation of her works. All right, she is the artist 
(and a very talented one at that), and her interpretation of her own works
has more validity than some lame-brain fan who just likes listening to these
works (ie. me!). HOWEVER, we are all entitled to make our own interpretations
of her works, and they are valid to us , and to other people if it makes sense.
There is no one, true interpretation of a work of art. Anyway, enough waffle -
here's the posting..........

&gt; Article 4589 of rec.arts.movies:
&gt; Subject: Re: Citizen Kane, and how not to watch movies
  (blah, blah, blah deleted)
&gt;The answer to all the above questions is:  Because those are the criteria
&gt;that I chose to use.  Look, this may come as a surprise to you, but 
&gt;appreciation of any art form is a purely subjective matter.  There is no
&gt;"right" or "wrong" criteria to use in forming a judgement.  If, to me,
&gt;"good" painting requires a recognizable human face, then Picasso is a lousy
&gt;artist _to me_.  Does the fact that I am in a minority with this opinion
&gt;make me "wrong"?  Does the fact that the "art experts" disagree with me
&gt;make me "wrong"?  No.  It just makes me different (and wouldn't it be
&gt;boring as hell if we all agreed on everything).  You, sir, do not get to
&gt;decide whether or not my approach is "appropriate".  The creator of the
&gt;art does not even get that privilege.  It is mine alone, just as you
&gt;are the only one who gets to decide what _your_ approach will be.
&gt;I will relate to you something my writing teacher told me, which applies
&gt;equally to all art and which you would do well to remember:  Once a work
&gt;of art leaves its creator's hands it is _no longer his_.  It belongs
&gt; to the public.  It does not matter what the creator intended, it only
&gt;matters what the viewer/reader sees.
(more blah, blah, blah deleted)

See what I mean? 
(ahem..What's IED doing that flame-thrower? Is |&gt;oug reaching for his matches at
this very instant?? All will be revealed in their next postings folks!)
