 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: MisK.

     Just a note on _Babooshka_'s grammar: IED has studied two early
versions of this song, and there can be no doubt that in those early
versions Kate wrote _and_sang_ "worse move". No "T" sound at all.
Therefore her inclusion of the "T" sound in the final version was
either a.) a very peculiar but deliberate change on her part which
was made apparently purely for the sake of the _sound_; or b.) a
little slip of the tongue which she decided was not worth scrapping
the whole take to fix. Judging from the strength of the "T" sound
the former explanation seems likeliest. She just stuck a "T" sound
on there. Now there is another possible explanation, and that is that
perhaps she meant to keep the grammar correct ("worse"), so left
the "correct" grammar on the lyrics-sheet, but at the same time wanted
to introduce _still_another_twist_of_meaning_ to the phrase, so in the
vocal, added the "T". Whatever the reason, there is _no_possibility_
that Kate didn't know the correct grammatical construction--she not
only wrote it out for the lyrics, she also sang it correctly in two
early versions of the song.
     And if some of you are now extremely curious about where IED got
access to two early versions of _Babooshka_, he'll just say that they
were broadcast once on UK radio by Kate herself, and the tapes are
floating around for traders to find. Good luck. (No, no _obsKuriTies_3_
is planned--all those projeKTs are a thing of the past.)
