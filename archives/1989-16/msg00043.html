&gt;Really-From: jw@math.mit.edu
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well, I read a "Rolling Stone" article on Gabriel last summer, and in
&gt;response to a question about drugs in the sixties he said "the only
&gt;drug I was ever interested in was acid, and I was too scared of my 
&gt;ordinary dreams to try that." I always thought this was the thinking
&gt;person's attitude, so I had a lot of respect for this.

Hah!  What about empirical evidence?  Ever hear of that?  "Thinking
persons" attitude?  I scoff!  It's almost as bad as my (clearly
deranged) sister refusing to listen to any other Kate songs than
"Wuthering Heights" just cos she thinks they won't be as good...

&gt;A (creative) person could certainly write about a "drug" experience
&gt;that was not chemically induced. Though why would one want to?

Well, I would assume that if it were a chemical experience worth writing
about, then writing about it at the time would be extremely difficult.  At
least, I would hope so!

&gt;In "Houdini" I believe Kate writes "...using code only you and I know..."
&gt;so she must be able to write using proper grammar. My own theory
&gt;with regard to "You and me knew life itself..." is that it fits the
&gt;meter a little better, and is consonant.

I looked up "consonant" in my unabridged dictionary (yes, this is a
real happening saturday night 'round the Drukman residence) and, while
I readily admit that the sentence does indeed fit the definition, I
am at a loss as to the significance.  In other words: big deal!  Are
you being sarcastic?  (I haven't been exposed to any sarcasm in a while
so I don't recognize it easily any more... Henceforth include an X-Sarcasm
header line, OK?)

&gt;For Drukman:
&gt;&gt; the one who repeatedly spells my last name "Druckman" which is ALMOSt as
&gt;&gt; bad as you spelling it "JOHN."
&gt;
&gt;An astonishing spelling error indeed! 
&gt;(Besides, you should write "..your spelling..")
&gt;
&gt;(I'm only being mean to you because I liked Zardoz.)

Bah, I was using a colloquial mode of speech.  Presumably you didn't
get it because I didn't put it in the "X-Pretension-Factor" header
line.

(I'm only being mean to you because Zardoz was a complete crock.)
