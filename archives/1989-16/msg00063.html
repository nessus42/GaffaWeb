Quoted-From: Doug Alan &lt;nessus@athena.mit.edu&gt;
&gt;But at least if you are going to accuse someone of
&gt;something, please accuse them of the crime they have done or are
&gt;likely to do.  IED has not considered here distributing copyrighted
&gt;material that is widely available commercially.  So don't say that he
&gt;is likely to.  This is slander, and is also a crime.

Don't be an idiot.  Parody is a protected activity under the first
amendment and has been since day 1.  But then, you've already shown
more than once that you can't even recognize parody, much less
understand it.

&gt;What IED was considering may or may not be wrong, but it is
&gt;*different* in many ways, and you do not do intelligent discussion any
&gt;service by refusing to acknowledge the difference.

Yes, of course it's wrong.  I think under any reasonable system of
ethics, it's far worse to knowingly invade someone's privacy and
disseminate private materials which they do not want distributed, than
it is to deprive an already wealthy individual of a few dollars of
profits.  That is, the crime Andrew Marvick actually committed is worse
than the crime I alluded to in my satirical posting.  They're both
wrong, but the invasion of privacy is far more serious than the theft
of a few bucks from a multimillionaire.

Since this is miscellany, I should also note here that there's a Giger
folio I forgot to mention.  It's from 1988, and is from Edition C in
Zurich.  The copy I've seen is available at COMIC RELIEF in Berkeley CA
for $94.  The title is H.R. GIGER'S BIOMECHANOIDS.  Despite the title,
it is a fairly eclectic selection of Giger's more recent work.  He is
continuing to improve, hard as that may be to believe; the prints show
few of the muddied greens and browns of his earlier work, and he uses a
wider range of high-level compositions.  It's probably the best Giger
folio to date.
