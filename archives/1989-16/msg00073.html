 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: KT (bootleg) NEWS; plus a message for Steve Schonberger

     First, here is the big bootleg news: after more than three
months Volume Two of _The_Cathy_Demos_ has finally appeared in import
shops in the Hollywood area; naturally, IED has obtained a copy.
     The new record is packaged and designed in the same style as the
first volume: it consists of a seven-inch EP, packed in a plain white
inner-sleeve, which in turn is contained in a white outer-sleeve of
lightweight cardpaper. On the front of the outer sleeve is a black-
and-white reproduction of one of the photographs taken by John Carder
Bush of Kate when she was about eight or nine years old. It is a candid
shot showing her sitting cross-legged with hands resting on the top of
a cane in front of her chin, and with a four-pack of fresh milk-bottles
in her lap. Below the photo on the otherwise blank white cover are the
words (set, as in the first volume, in a type-style similar to that on
_Hounds_of_Love_): "KATE BUSH   Cathy Demos Volume Two". On the back of
the sleeve is a close-up of Kate's hands from the same photograph, over
which are listed the track-listing: "Side One: _Kashka_From_Bhagdad_
&lt;sic&gt;, _Camila_ &lt;sic&gt;, _Oh_To_Be_In_Love_. Side Two: _In_My_Lover's_
_Room_ &lt;sic&gt;, _Snow_Bowl_ &lt;sic&gt;." Below the photo on the back the series
number (IED's copy is No. 280 of 600, for whatever the bootleggers' word
is worth on such a subject) and the catalogue number: KB002.
     The record itself is pressed this time in translucent green vinyl
(the first EP was pressed in red vinyl), and the labels (this time like
the first EP's) are black with white pseudo-_HoL_ writing. The catalogue
number is the same on the record as on the outer sleeve (that was not
the case for the first EP). The timing of each of the five tracks is
given on the labels. On the runout groove of side A are the words:
"I HAVE BELLIE BAD LUCK", and on side B the words: "YOU WISHED IT
ON YOURSELF". IED will not hazard a guess as to the meaning, if any,
of these phrases.
     The most interesting thing about these transfers of the demos,
in IED's opinion, is that, as with the first EP, the sound appears
to have been "cleaned up" a bit before pressing. IED doesn't know
how this was done (or even whether it was deliberate), but not only
is the hiss of the original tape considerably reduced in the EP
version, but the by-now very familiar (and much beloved) clicks and
page-turning noises which punctuate each song on the master tape have
been omitted for the transfer to vinyl.
     Some may be wondering what songs are those which the bootleggers
have so strangely identified (see IED's "&lt;sic&gt;s" above). The two familiar
titles are Kashka_From_Baghdad_ (misspelled "Bhagdad" by the bootleggers)
and _Oh_To_Be_In_Love_. This leaves only one song--_Violin_--
among the five LP-song demos contained in the full collection
of 22, which has not yet been released on vinyl by bootleggers. The track
_Camilla_ (misspelled _Camila_ on the EP) has also been identified
(by Theo Haast in the Dutch Kate Bush fanzine _Kate_) as _Surrender_
_Into_the_Roses_. _In_My_Lover's_Room_ is the song which IED identified
as _Playing_Canasta_in_Cold_Rooms_ (a much better title for identifi-
cation purposes because the word "room" in the phrase from which the
bootleggers derive their title is highly suspect. KT could simply be
singing "Ooh...") Finally, _Snow_Bowl_ is plainly a mistaken reading
of the lyrics sung by Kate in the song IED has identified as _Hot_in
_the_Ice_ or _Set_in_the_Snow_. Kate is actually saying "snowball",
not "snow bowl".

     On quite another note, IED must send the following message to
Steve Schonberger via Love-Hounds, because he has been totally unable
to mail anything to Steve via his UUNET address. Steve, if you have any
alternative means of access to other e-mailers, please let IED know.
IED was glad to learn that you had not taken his words on Reich
amiss. You will know by now that IED absolutely _must_ rebut any and
all remarks which he sees as in even the most indirect way interpretable
as criticism of Kate Bush. Hence his 145-line-long counter-rebuttal of
yesterday.
     Regarding your ideas re a Fest 2, IED supports the idea with
enthusiasm. (He sent off a letter to you via Mike Kinsella last week,
hoping Mike would find a way to reach you, but without success.) The
"2" idea is excellent. If you need help which you think IED might be
able to provide, please let him know, and he will try to oblige.
Also, IED suggests that the larger the city, the better the chances
of a good result, no? L.A. humbly recommended, therefore. Date: perhaps
around November 1?
