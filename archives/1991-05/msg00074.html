Richard Caldwell quotes Ed Suranyi quoting Steve Thomas:
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm glad that I did get a proper copy, because (IMHO) the final
&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes, just before the credits, when Kate is finishing her
&gt;&gt;&gt; routine for "Wuthering Heights" and is jumping around waving
&gt;&gt;&gt; at the audience in extreme high spirits, is the most delightful
&gt;&gt;&gt; part of the video.

i usually jump up and down and wave back at this point.  my housemates
are used to it.

and then Richard says:
&gt; ...I was speculating as to why someone who so obviously enjoyed performing
&gt; as the Kate that we see in those last few minutes of the Hammersmith show
&gt; would avoid live performances for so long.  It seemed to me that
&gt; somewhere along the line she developed an industrial strength case of
&gt; stage fright.

Sir Laurence Olivier was stricken by disabilitating stage fright while
directing and starring with the National Theatre -- this was after three
or four decades of performing.  also, in my limited experience with
performing, by the time you are waving good-bye you feel *great*;  it's
that moment waiting for the curtain to go up, or when you actually notice
the audience, that is so terrifying.

more Richard:

&gt; Generally I think we should consider the Hammersmith version of all of
&gt; the early songs to be definitive.  Kate could do whatever she liked
&gt; with those versions while Andrew Powell had his hands all over the
&gt; first two albums. 

this explains those greasy fingerprints.  but seriously, i concur whole-
heartedly -- and soon (!?) we will have all new versions to admire!!!

and just a bit more:
&gt; I wonder whether Kate's original vision of _James and the Cold Gun_
&gt; included the instrumental portion that she added for the live show.
&gt; I love it even when I can't see her slinking about and blasting bad
&gt; guys!

i don't know why this never hit me before, but that body-suit Ms. Bush 
wears in the live _JatCG_ is straight out of "the avengers".  and me
a serious mrs. peel fan, too.  wonder if this is concious (the outfit
never fit the gangster imagery...)

my friend dan (hi dan) says that having a full color screen sized background
of a digitized KaTe on one's work-station limits one's productivity, 'cuz
you keep moving the windows around so that you can see Her.  i'll let you
know about this, as soon as i can figure out how to post email from this
little tiny window at the edge of the screen...

footah!
