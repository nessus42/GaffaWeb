not much tonight...

i have a copy of _the garden_ if anyone wants it. if enought requests
come though, i'll post it to the list - but it *is* big, so it might
be better just to stick to personal requests rather than flooding the 
world with it.

somebody asked about hex. greg summed them up pretty well. no, they
don't tour. however, on the acoustic tour that steve kilbey did last
fall, he did do a number of hex songs. like greg, i am quite partial
to the first release. the second, well, it just hasn't hit me yet. i
have tried about three times to listen to it and i just never quite
get past the first few songs.

somebody else asked about comparing box set sound with other cds of
the same album. well, i shall let derek and the "comparing contin-
gent" do that work - i have not even opened the non-b-sides jewel
boxes yet! :)

and finally: after being separated from a vcr for about six months,
during which time i had _the collection_, i finally was able to view
that cassette. the only new clips for me were the snl performance,
the performance of "suspended in gaffa", the "babooshka" with the 
cloak and "them heavy people" ala tuxedo. not to bad - though the
video quality is pretty rotten. to be expected i suppose...but one
always wants the picture to look sharp. also, i recently got a copy
of an interview with victoria (or is it laura?) brown from a pro-
gram called "the new music" (canadian). interesting interview from
the time of _the whole story_. nothing terribly new, but KaTe sure
did seem more political than i had ever heard her when she talked o
of "experiment iv" and practically downright criticized the military
for exploiting the postive creations of science for destructive pur-
poses. while she didn't seem angry, i think she was a bit agitated
by the question...most intriguing. she also tied "cloudbusting" into
that theme as well. has anybody else (besides richard locke) seen
this interview?
