&gt;Vickie here.
&gt;

&gt;Yes, she painted the covers of Vol. I &amp; II. Yes, Rearmament is a photo. It's
&gt;Happy. I think Ecto is a photo too, I can't remember the details about it.
&gt;I &amp; II are "demons that lurk."

Now I'm even more impressed with her...;-)

&gt;&gt; c) Has anybody ever taken the time to transcribe any of the lyrics?  Over
&gt;&gt; the summer I did "Don't Want to Hear It" (there were a couple of words I 
&gt;&gt; couldn't figure) and "Ode" and I think I may have done another one or
&gt;&gt; two.
&gt;
&gt;Happy sent me the lyrics to Ecto but has never herself sat down and trans-
&gt;cribed the lyrics of the first three. I've never done it myself. It needs
&gt;to be done because on so many songs there are so many voices that it's
&gt;hard to pick out lyrics. Anyone who's willing to help work on it? We
&gt;could get them to a point where we only have a few words missing and I
&gt;could send a semi-final version to Happy for her to finish up. She'd be
&gt;willing to do that.

YES!

I'd already started working on transcribing bunches of the songs anyway.

I don't know how we'd want to coordinate something like this--I'm sure the
mailing-list part of Love-Hounds doesn't want to see billions of copies
half-completed Happy lyrics showing up in their mailboxes.  I'm willing to
try coordinating an effort...something along the lines of I'd keep a list
of people willing to work on lyrics.  As I work on or receive copies of
lyrics from people, I can mail them out to those on the list.  People can
then send me corrections/suggestions.  After a few days of nothing new, I
can send out our "final" version.

Anyone willing to help on this?

I've currently got partial lyrics to:  "Possessed," "Given In," "Moonbeam
Friends," "Step Inside," "The Wretches Gone Awry," "Noone Here," "To the
Funny Farm," "The Perfect Irony," "I Am A Legend," and "Crystal Orbs."

The only one I'm at all sure of my accuracy on is "Possessed" (possibly
my favorite song by her!).  I still haven't decided if the first word
is 'paralyzed' or 'tantalized' but...

(who's been working on lyrics to _Rearmament_, but has completely given
up on "For We Believe")
