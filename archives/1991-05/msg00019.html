Hi, Love-Hounds.
   For the last three weeks IED has been reading faithfully (but alas
not KonTributing to) Love-Hounds. He hopes soon to be able to send a
few interesting vintage KT texts your way, but in the meantime, here
are a few comments in response to recent postings:
    First, further congratulations to Ron Hill are in order for the
splendid job he did with the photographic record of the KonvenTion.
IED, like so many others who received copies of the photos, enjoyed
them immensely. Particularly magical to IED was the photograph of Kate
at the very moment when she held in her hands the official Love-Hounds
bouquet (four dozen white roses with a big card saying "TO KATE FROM
THE LOVE-HOUNDS--USA AND THE WORLD" on it)--in fact, Ron's shot
perfectly conveys the moment when Kate must actually have been reading
the card itself (she is looking at the card in the cellophane)--and to
add to the magic, projected on the video-screens behind Kate is a view
of the bouquet from another angle, on which can be read the letters
"FROM THE LOVE-H--"! The shot also shows Dave Cross, who has just
handed the flowers to Kate and explained who they were from! Just one
of Love-Hounds' several small but not insignificant moments of glory,
folks! And all you philocanines who were unfortunately unable to
attend were in the thoughts of those who could be there. Thanks again,
Ron, for the great pictures. 
   Par Fornland asks what _Rocket's Tail_ is all about: the song is a
little story about a young person who, in a final desperate moment of
life (the details of which have not been explained), has actually
strapped onto his/her back a rocket and shot him/herself into the air
from Waterloo Bridge into the river. In the first part of the song
this person recalls a conversation he/she had had with a friend one
Guy Fawkes night, in which the friend had remarked upon the beauty of
the fireworks (rockets). The narrator wryly recalls how he/she had
originally thought such an idea crazy--that the momentary brilliance
of the rockets was a sad waste. The irony is that in the second half
of the song, the narrator has not only come to share his/her friend's
opinion (that life is short, and that a moment of brilliant glory is
worth seeking even if it should be one's last act in life)--he/she has
even taken the idea to its ultimate expression, i.e., jumping off a
bridge in a rocket-suit.
    A great moment in the history of art.
    Welcome to Bill Wisner--a belated but heartfelt welcome--as
Love-Hounds' new Humble Pseudo-Moderator. Good luck, Bill!
    Ed: Thanks again for all your invaluable information. By the way,
do you have the address of _Dreaming_Fairies_ near at hand? And its
subscription rates for USA Airmail, by any chance? Thanks.
   Anders: Thanks for the information in re _Passing_Through_Air_.
Ditto to Patrick Jost. Second ditto to Dave Steiner. All of your
e-mail to IED was much appreciated. 
    buckaroo@APPLE.COM: in re _The_Garden_: IED is sorry but for the
next four months at least, _The_Garden_ is simply inaccessible to this
Love-Hound. Does anyone else have a complete copy in his/her files,
which they might be able to forward part or all of to buckaroo? IED
should warn any other interested parties that _The_Garden_ is a
compendium of information for the Serious Kate Bush Fan. It now runs
to well over one thousand pages of fine print, making it far too
costly to print!
   In re KT videos: remember the availability of all of Kate's
official video releases n LASER-DISK, at least in Japan. If you care
about the quality of your video colleKTion, consider the laser option.
At last report, _The_Single_File_, _Hammersmith_Odeon_,
_The_Whole_Story_ and _The_Hair_of_the_Hound_ (a CAV version of the
four _Hounds_of_Love_ videos) were all still available through a small
number of dealers in the States who are willing to obtain Japanese
laser-disks upon request. Also, _The_Sensual_World_ video program is
available on laser-disk domestically.
   John asks why a discussion group dediKaTed to Kate Bush has to
always be focused on--Kate Bush? IED can devise no suitable answer to
this remarkable question. Maybe it's just too deep...
   As already observed by another Love-Hound, the "fake" live
video--clearly a reference to the _Them_Heavy_People_ video--is in
fact not "fake" at all, but a video-tape of a one-off live in-studio
performance by Kate and the KT Bush Band. 
   Best of luck to Greg Bossert, Katemas 1991!
   In re Derek Langsford's observations about the boxed set's CD
sound: IED would just like to caution anyone making comparisons of
sound quality that not all UK editions of the CD boxed set were alike!
IED remembers one early Love-Hounds report which described the
boxed-set's _Lionheart_ CD as the "Fame!" re-pressing (a UK budget
series of re-pressings of once-popular albums). Yet IED's UK boxed-set
edition of that album on CD was an original, pre-"Fame!" pressing. IED
therefore assumes that EMI was using the boxed set as a vehicle for
scrounging up and dumping on the public all excesss KT stock, from all
periods, without a care for the various editions' original stated
value or price.
   Neil Calton: thankyou for the AMAZING news tidbit from _Q_
Magazine, about Kate's reported turnup at a London studio to work on
overdubs for a _NEW_ALBUM_! WOWWOWWOW!
   Again to Ron Hill: Alas, IED has no access to his transcript of the
entire Kate Bush section of the KonvenTion. Perhaps you might find
some other kindly Love-Hound out there who took the trouble to save
that transcript?
   Phong asks: are the _Passing_Through_Air_ and
_If_You_Could_See_Me_Fly_ bootleg CDs "worth it"? Worth it!!?? Well,
that depends on whether all you care about is sound quality, or
whether you actually care about getting access to seventeen of the
greatest songs of the twentieth century--none of which is yet
available through legitimate channels. If hiss and pops are so
distracting to you that they prevent you from appreciating the
incalculable, towering Godhead that is "Playing Canasta in Cold
Rooms", then no, IED supposes that these CDs are not "worth it".
   To Whisnant Kerry Lewis: All the rest of us look forward to news of
the new LP and tour, as well. Do you have any???
   In response to a question about the late, still-lamented
_Break-Through_ magazine: There were some eleven issues of that
fanzine in all, the last few of which were more the work of Tracy
Robyn Somerville than of the publication's founder, Dale Somerville.
The shift in leadership was due to the founder's gradual descent into
some sort of bizarre religious zealotry which reportedly climaxed with
a conviction that Kate was the Devil Incarnate. Robyn, happily,
resuscitated the fanzine a couple of years later with
_Still_Breathing_, which as far as IED knows is still sporadically
active. All of Dale's and Robyn's fanzines about Kate are worth
owning, particularly the third through eighth issues of
_Break-Through_, which are still classics of their kind.
   Bye bye for now. Meanwhile, IED is still reading...
