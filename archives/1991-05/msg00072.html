<PRE>
   Kate was once asked (through the KBC Newsletter) the identity of
the man in the photo on the cover of "The Dreaming". Her reply was,
"Why, Houdini, of course." 
   IED's guess is that the man is Anthony Van Laast, Kate's one-time
dance instructor and collaborator on the choreography for some of her
early videos and the Tour of Life.
   For those who are wondering what "The Garden" is: "The Garden" is
an unwieldly collection of lists, catalogues, lyrics, articles and
interviews by and/or about Kate Bush, transcribed (with the help of
a number of other Love-Hounds, including Ed Suranyi, Doug Alan, MarK
T. Ganzer, Tippi Chai, etc.) by Andrew Marvick (IED) and once intended
for hard-copy printout and wide dissemination. Alas! the text quickly
grew too large to make paper copies affordable--the postage alone for
a text weighing some five pounds would be prohibitive for some
locations, let alone the cost of a decent laser-printout and even
the simplest velo-binding. As a result, _The_Garden_ remains, except
to a few early participants in the project, merely a well organized
alternative or supplement to the Love-Hounds Archives--and equally 
difficult to access!
   Greg asked about a poster-ography. IED has never had the time
to make one, but he knows of at least fifty, perhaps as many as 
sixty-five or seventy, different Kate Bush posters--a certain number
of which are near-duplicates of each other, but different enough in
detail and source to merit inclusion in the total. There are at least
forty different posters using different imagery. Perhaps IED and Ed
and Chris'n'Vickie could find the time next summer to put together a
proper catalogue of KT posters?
   woj: The interviewer on the Canadian programme to which you refer
was Laurie Brown. There are two versions of that show: the one you
described, and a one-hour-long version (the interview is no longer 
than on the half-hour version, but it is supplemented by clips from
an earlier pair of interviews done by Canadian TV as well as more
complete clips from Kate's videos) called "The Story So Far..." It
is a wonderful interview--great, well-prepared questions respectfully
asked, with fascinating, serious answers from Kate. There is also a
brief glimpse of Kate's new home (in Eltham?). Kate herself looks 
less than her best--she was in the midst of wrestling with "The
Sensual World" at the time, though we didn't know it then, and she
had clearly _not_ yet resumed her dancing regimen. In fact, wasn't
it in this interview that she described the "RUTH" video as her 
"farewell to dance"--a pronouncement which has very happily proved
to be inaccurate--?
   Dead Dog Robey asks about "The Dreaming" posters: There have been
at least three different editions of the poster featuring the front
cover of "The Dreaming" LP. The first is now the rarest (IED saw an
ad recently for copies of this UK-only edition at 30 Pounds recently):
KATE BUSH and THE DREAMING are sub- and super-titling a large blow-up
of the cover photo. There was later a second pressing of nearly the
same poster, except that the title and Kate's name had traded places,
and the edges of the letters (upon close inspection) are saw-toothed--
the letters were very smooth and sharp-edged in the original. The
original poster is visible in a collection of photographs of Kate 
dating from her appearance at the Virgin Megastore to sign copies of
the album in 1982--shots from this collection have appeared from time
to time in various fanzines and books, mainly because they were sold
for years by Pete Still Photography, a mail-order business.
   About two years ago IED came across a third edition of the same
poster--this time a bit smaller in size, and the whole thing printed
in monochrome orangeish-brown ink. IED has heard that this poster was
actually available in more than one shade of brown in different parts
of the US--but it is believed to be American in origin, and it didn't
cost much money. Perhaps you may still run across it in some stores,
or at a swapmeet, someday.
   That's all for now, folks. If you're feeling blue, take comfort in
the supremely heartening knowledge that SHE'S GONNA TOUR!
