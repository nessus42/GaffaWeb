&gt;From: mpf0642@njitx.njit.edu
&gt;The way Kate Bush worked and used the already worldwide known
&gt;qualities and enchantments of Bulgarian Folk singing is foolish and
&gt;naive.

&gt;So, where's the originality ? I even don't think that originality is
&gt;an issue, but the way she took away the brightness of these singers and
&gt;their songs is. I could start telling you about marketing,
&gt;but maybe some other time.

The poster may be unaware of the Rhythms of the World interview I posted
back in March, so here is a pertinent part for contemplation.

Kate:	I first heard their music about three years ago when I was just
	finishing the last album, through my brother Paddy who has always
	been interested in ... in ethnic music and collected instruments,
	since he was a kid really, and he played me a tape and I couldn't
	believe how beautiful it was. I listened to it all the time and
	thought how lovely it would be if perhaps on the next album I'd
	be able to somehow work with them; somehow incorporate their
	music with my own.

	So then we had to find out how to best approach it so, as not to
	just use them in the music for the sake of it, but to make the
	most of what they do. Because what they do is so special. And,
	really through a process of elimination we decided the best thing
	to do was actually to go to Bulgaria and to meet them and to work
	with them there with their arranger and work out the process
	there in Bulgaria.


Eva:	[translated] Music does not recognise the existence of two systems.
	Music travels around the world without a visa, without a passport.
	Music is international. The opportunity our Trio had to record with
	Kate Bush was very important to us and we consider it a great
	honour. I think that everything went well. We coped well with the
	variety of rhythms and our composer [sic. probably arranger was
	the correct translation] Dimitar Penev was a great help. I think
	that Kate Bush was satisfied with the work we did together. I think
	she chose to work with Trio Bulgarka because we are folk singers
	with strong musical roots and able to meet any musical challenge
	we are faced with.

It is clear the Trio were as delighted to work with Kate as she
was to work with them. Mutual respect and understanding on both sides.
So lay off with the criticisms.

P.S. In the latest issue of Q magazine (Dec.) there is an advert from
Hannibal Records for the Trio Bulgarka's album "The Forest is Crying".
The ad states "As featured on Kate Bush's 'The Sensual World'"

So Hannibal clearly expect to sell lots more Trio albums through
their collaboration with Kate.

Be seeing you.
Neil
