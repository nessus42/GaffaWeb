    Well, here's the poop on the enigmatic giggle at the end of "Love and
    Anger."
    
    Fact 1: The British EMI CD puts it at the end of track 2.
    Fact 2: The American CBS CD puts it at the start of track 3.
    Fact 3: It ain't in the video
    Fact 4: It ain't on the promo CD single
    
    Clearly, someone's messed up somewhere.  Since we're never going to
    find out the TRUE (if there is one) answer, I propose a little
    love-hound survey.  Where do YOU think it should go, and why?  I'll
    compile the answers into a humorous, yet incisive little article after
    I get a bunch of responses.  ("A puckish satire of contemporary
    mores"?)
    
    Send them HERE, to ME, NOT TO THE LIST!  If you send them to the list,
    we will kill you.  That is all.

Obviously, the laugh is on the wrong album entirely!  I suggest it 
is the result of a long, often fruitless fight between Kate and the
record companies.  For years, Kate has wanted to insert a laugh between
tracks, and for years the record execs have nayed the proposition.

Originally, the laugh was to go between Strange Phenomena and Kite on
TKI.  When this plan was nixed, Kate decided to place the laugh after
Peter Pan on Lionheart.  And after that on NFE at the very end of the album.
Again, to no avail, but this time the execs met Kate half way and let her
add a little extra bass at the end of Breathing instead.

Despite the first three rejections, Kate endeavoured once more to
include the laugh on TD just after Suspended in Gaffa.  The execs
dismissed this demand as unreasonably antagonistic towards the general
public who would have a hard enough time figuring out just what Gaffa
was (not to mention the "WLTWI" at the culmination of the very next track)
without the added intimidation of a mocking laugh.  

So it was HoL where Kate was first able to sneak in the laugh, cleverly
mixed *backwards* into the secret message in WYWM, the forward contents
of which were discovered by fans only recently.  Luckily, the record
execs never discovered this laugh, although its effect is all but lost
in the mix.  But Kate was still unsatisfied, since she knew most people
would probably never know the laugh was even there.

TWS was the next candidate for the laugh, but since it had never charted
as a single, the execs refused.  Kate even volunteered to redo the laugh
as a "new vocal" cut, but alas, no go.

Finally, Kate had had enough.  "Look," she said, "no more albums unless
I get a full, uncut, forward, undistorted laugh on the next one."
British execs gave in, but Kate had to change labels in America to 
have her demand met.  

But still, it wasn't easy... a full year of bickering about where the
laugh should go on the new album ensued and caused unprecedented delays
in release.  And now we see the fruits of Kate's effort: the laugh, in
full, is indeed a part of TSW.  But in attaching the laugh to different
songs on the two pressings of the CD, and omitting it entirely from the
single and the video, it looks like in the final analysis the bigwigs
still had the last laugh.
