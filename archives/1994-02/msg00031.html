&gt; I bought another copy of The Whole Story last night. I was
&gt; looking at the track listings, and was wondering why some songs
&gt; (like Wow) were there, and others (like Moving) were not.
 
That's simple: The Whole Story was a "commercially correct"
product, consisting of single releases, not of so-called "album
tracks".
 
&gt; I really don't think this album represents Kate's absolute best,
 
Neither do I, but from the singles that were released it was not so
bad a selection...
 
&gt; NEW THREAD! NEW THREAD!
&gt; If you had to put together a compilation album, with 15 tracks
&gt; maximum, what songs would you put on it and in what order? And
&gt; what would you call it?
 
It depends if it has to be sold. An artisticly correct album often
doesn't sell. So, I've come up with a solution for that: a double
album for the price of one. The first disc of 15 songs would then
include:
 
Running up that hill / Babooshka / The man with the child in his
eyes (the 7" version, at long last, on CD!) / Hounds of Love /
The sensual world / Wuthering heights / Wow // Them heavy people
("live") / Sat in your lap / Army dreamers (also the 7" version) /
Breathing / Cloudbusting / Rubberband girl / Rocket man / ...and a
new track, recorded for this album [Sorry Kate, but you have to
work again...] to promote the project. Hopefully a strong track
which'll become a hit.
 
The second, more interesting CD:
 
Be kind to my mistakes (film version; Never heard that one :-( ) /
The wedding list / Symphony in blue / Blow away / The kick inside
/ Waking the witch / Song of Solomon / Jig of life / Reaching out
/ Suspended in Gaffa / This woman's work / Warm and soothing /
Feel it / You're the one / Never be mine / All the love / One last
look around the house before we go... /
 
Well, it contains 17 songs, but the last one is so short... - But
_SO_ beautiful.
 
BTW, on the CD-single they could put "The seer" with Big Country (a
_brilliant_ song) and the "video" version of Cloudbusting... Ahhh,
just dreaming now...
 
I would have called it "Moments of pleasure" but left that track
out. So a nice alternative would be the name of the new track...
Unless that one's called "Experiment 5" ;-)
 
&gt; I would call it...hmmm...Kate's Golden Greats 1978-1994 !
 
Yuk! Kinda Tacky. It's the sort of title one would use for a Roger
Whittaker album... It also vaguely reminds me of an epitaph...
 
I like the collection, actually. I think I will record it on a tape
to try it out. Well, except the "new track" of course... ;-)
