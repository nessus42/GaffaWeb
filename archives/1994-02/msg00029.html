Melissa Ferrick is from Ipswich Mass...the reason you may not have heard 
of her before is that she just had her first album released this 
summer....the press has definitely taken to her...praising her often in 
multiple reviews across the us...and including her as one of the women 
changing the face of music today...but noonw seems to have heard her 
music.
she has a very beautiful voice that quavers intensely.
I've been listening to her for umm...2 1/2 years now...i believe it was 
the summer of '91 that morrissey picked her up and brought her on tour 
with him in europe....he was impressed by her apparently when she opened 
for him at Great Woods in Mass....because his opening act was 
ill....since then she has appeared in various local "folk festivals' etc
last year halloween time she opened for Bob Dylan at Endicott Collegfe in 
beverly mass   again a wonderful performance as she has always 
been...unfortunatly the crowd was ONLY there to see dylan.
she normally plays with just her voice and one guitar but since this 
summer when a full album was released   her label has been working to put 
together a tour band for her.
I have only had the opportunity to hear her 3 times and i wish it were 
more...but i do know that she secretly gained a lot of attention and even 
opened for Jah Wobble!    hopefully her success will continue..she 
deserves it
