Hi everyone,
 
I am starting the new year very good by reading "The Garden". IED
did a great job compiling the lot, and I recommend everyone to get
this electronic publication asap if it's not already in your
possession.
 
Nonetheless, there are a few points of interest that I want to
bring to everyones attention.
 
For instance, there is a demo song mentioned in "The Garden" called
"A waltz growing old". On "Passing through air", the CD with this
track, it called "A rose growing old", but IED states that's wrong.
I have a lot of trouble of imagining a waltz growing old. After
all, dances are not in the habit of having an age. Roses do grow
old. They can wither, and die.
So either I am misunderstanding the whole concept of this song -
which I doubt - or "A waltz growing old" is an incorrect
interpretation of what Kate sings. Any comments, anyone?
 
&gt;    10. Die Efteling Tapes: Six videos (some refer to seven, but
&gt; I only know of six), taped in the Efteling Gardens (a gothic
&gt; theme-park), Amsterdam, April 1978.
 
As I have stated in the past, De Efteling can be found not in
Amsterdam, but in Kaatsheuvel, in the south of Holland. (Last year
it has been proclaimed the best amusement park in the world btw.)
 
&gt;    11. Wuthering Heights: lip-synch, on an April, 1978 edition
&gt; of German TV programme Top Pop. Note: Ruud says this is a Dutch
&gt; programme. Peter says it is German.
 
Toppop was a Dutch programme, which ran, either from 1970 or 1975,
until the late 1980s. I presume this recording is from this
programme. I have never heard from a German Toppop. Maybe Uli
knows. I have to assume this is a Dutch performance until proven
otherwise.
 
&gt;    13. Voor de Vuist Weg, Kate's appearance on the Dutch TV show,
&gt; April 1978. I do not know what this appearance consists of. Peter
&gt; mentions it in his chronology, but I have never seen the clip.)
 
"Voor de vuist weg" was a talk-show by the world-famous (well, in
Holland anyway) Willem Duys. Kate appeared in this show to perform
"Wuthering heights", probably lip-synching. At the end of her
appearance she received a rose from Willem. Regrettably, I don't
have a recording of this appearance.
 
&gt;   100. Music Box: Kate is interviewed at some length, at the
&gt; London Palladium. Shown on U.K. (Sky) TV, ca. 1985-86.
&gt;     I have never seen this interview.
 
Dunno if this has been talked about on the list already in the
past, but I have this special, be it slightly edited (I cut out the
Cloudbusting video 'cos I had recorded it several times before then
- what a shame.) One can place it at the end of 1985, and the
programme lasted for some 60 minutes. If it is still unknown by
most of you, I can transcribe the lot. But I'm wondering if this is
really such an unknown programme...?

"Rrreally happ'nin' to ya..."  -  Kate  Bush,  'The  red shoes',  which,
I  think, wasn't  a  good  choice for a  single release  anyway... &lt;MHO&gt;
