Hello everyone- my first posting here! :-) 

Over the Christmas holiday, a few days before Christmas, I was at a 
party, and someone was giving a sneak preview of what is supposed to
be an upcoming (but as yet unaired) public access cable TV show.
The show is called 'Projekt: X-Treme' (yes, that's how it was spelled)

One episode shown was a series of music videos, and among them was
Big Sky, but not the version I remembered from several years ago.
For one thing, the audio seemed out of synch with the opening sequence
of the video, and during the part where she's looking up with binoculars,
she points them upward, a jet fighter appears swooping in low.  From that
point on, the video was a montage of aircraft war footage, mostly Gulf War
bombing footage, leading up to a scene of a B-52 squadron's scramble takeoff,
and ending with shots of nuclear missiles launching, all synchronized with
the song 'Big Sky'.  The running time must have been at least 6 minutes, alot
longer than the original.   Obviously a parody of some sort.  

I know this can't be an official video, but is it a bootleg?  
I mean, has anyone else seen this?  One other video on the tape seemed
to be a similar parody: Enya's 'Sail Away' sychronized with a montage
of submarine war footage.

If it's not a bootleg in circulation, then it's something the producer
himself put together.  I didn't get a chance to ask about it, but if it 
is something he made himself, it would have been relatively easy to
do.

oh well.

I'm a relative newcomer to Bush's music (besides my memory of Big Sky from
several years ago :-) ) and I would like some suggestions on what would be
a good CD to start with.   

And have there been any video releases? - real ones, not like the one I saw
at that Christmas party! :-)  

enough rambling for now :-)  

Simon
