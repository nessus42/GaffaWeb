&gt; /Philadelphia Inquirer, Sunday January 9, 1994, Section F, pp. 1, 7/
&gt; 
&gt; [headline] A Return to Innocence
&gt; 
&gt; The notoriously shy composer, vocalist and cult heroine works in a

Is she really notoriously shy, or just reclusive?

&gt; major unblocking."  At various times on 'The Red Shoes,' the usually
&gt; reserved vocalist can be heard scat singing, babbling nonsense syllables
&gt; and screaming with abandon, reacting to the moment rather than to a
&gt; plan.

You can say that again...

&gt; Bush's distinctive Victorian soprano reinforces the impression.  Her
&gt; haunting, mewling vocals have helped her carve her own subgenre,
&gt; somewhere between too-sweet pop ballads and ostentatious art-rock,
&gt; between no-bull and florid love poetry, between the tactile and the
&gt; abstract.

I couldn't have said it better myself. Ahhh, that voice, that voice...

&gt; Whether they focus on grand themes or tiny frailties, her songs are
&gt; wracked with a hovering doubt, wary that fate might rearrange things at
&gt; any moment.

Huh?

&gt; back.  She's investigating past-lives therapy and communicating with her
&gt; angels.

Uhhh...yeah.

&gt; Respectfully, they shuffled by in an orderly line.  Couples with tears
&gt; in their eyes who gave Bush credit for bringing them together.  A woman
&gt; who begged for Bush to sign her arm, so she could go directly to the
&gt; tattoo parlor.  Legions of fans who waited in freezing weather for
&gt; nothing more than an autograph.

I hope she appreciated it!

&gt; When she returned to England, Bush's record company was clamoring for a
&gt; follow-up.  That's when the singer snapped.

Ahh, so that explains "Violin" and "Coffee Homeground" ;-)

&gt; measure, 1985's 'Hounds of Love,' yielded the single "Running Up That
&gt; Hill," but little else -- a three-years-in-the-making disappointment.

Give me a break!

Somebody scan these...

Overall, a really good article. I want a copy.
