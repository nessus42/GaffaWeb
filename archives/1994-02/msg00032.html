Thanks to the "really-deep-thoughts" mailing list for the following:

 
4. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:
 
Q: Where is Tori Amos from?
 
A: North Carolina, though she now lives in London, England.
 
Q: When was Tori born?
 
A: 22 August, 1963
 
Q: Where can I find a discography?
 
A: There's one stored at together with the archives (see section 3).
If you can't get it via ftp then ask me and I'll mail it to you.
 
Q: When will Tori's next album be out?
 
A: The new album is scheduled for release on 25th January '94, and the
title will be "Under The Pink".
 
Q: What is Y Kant Tori Read?
 
A: Before making Little Earthquakes, Tori was in an LA-based rock
band called Y Kant Tori Read. They produced a self-titled album in
1988 which was a critical and commercial failure. Opinions on this
album are divided: some of people consider it to be just a mediocre
radio-orientated rock album, while others think that there is still
some very good music there, though it is partly obscured by the heavy
rock production. Tori herself dislikes this album, partly because it
holds bad memories for her, and has described it as like "Madonna and
Kate Bush in a head-on collision after eating bad mushrooms".
 
Q: How can I get Y Kant Tori Read?
 
A: Interest in this album has been revitalized since Little Earthquakes.
Since it's been deleted for some time now, and very unlikely to be
re-released, it is now very difficult to come by. Jason Bilsky
(fuzzbox@world.std.com) has kindly offered to make tapes of the album
for rdt subscribers. You can send him a C60 tape, with a postage paid
return envelope, to:
 
        Jason Bilsky
        21 Gorham St.
        Apartment 2
        Waltham, MA 02154
        U.S.A.
 
Also send him your email address so he can send you confirmation and
let you know of any delays.
 
 
Q: Is Tori going to be playing at such-and-such any time soon?
 
A: There are no definite plans or dates for Tori's next tour yet. The
informal plans are that sh do a UK-based tour in Febuary/March of next year,
followed by a US and World tour. Details should appear on rdt as soon as they
become known.
 
Q: What is the Really Deep Thoughts fanzine?
 
A: There is now a Tori Amos fanzine, also called Really Deep
Thoughts, being produced by Melissa and Richard Caldwell. The magazne
is independent of this list, and it has the support of Tori and her
management.  Subscriptions are $15 per annum ($20 overseas). For
details write to:
 
        Really Deep Thoughts,
        P.O.Box 328606,
        Columbus,
        OH 43232
        USA
 
or send email to info@bsbbs.columbus.oh.us for more information.
 
Q: How can I write to Tori?
 
A: Tori has said that she gets huge amounts of mail and just doesn't
have time to answer it all, though she does read everything she gets.
So if you write to her, don't be dissapointed if you don't get a
reply. You can write to her, care of her management Spivak
Entertainment. The address is:

        Los Angeles,
        CA 90064.
 
Q: What is Tori's natural hair colour?
 
A: um, I don't know if I should reveal this one???
 
 
If you want to find out more background on Tori and her music, I'd
recommend starting with the interviews which are available by
anonymous ftp, or by email from me (rdt-owner@gradient...).
 
 
Post soon and enjoy the list!
