The cast (in order of appearance):
C&gt;Cynthia Rosas
A&gt;Andy Gough
D&gt;Jon Drukman (as the beaver)
W&gt;Me

Act One
=======

(The curtain is raised to reveal a gothic dungeon. Cynthia, dressed as
a nun, is reading from a large text.  Andy enters stage right,
wearing a professor's graduation robe)

C&gt;Pop as a genre would include RuTH, for instance, because it made it 
C&gt;in the top 40 pop charts.  I would not, however, call the song pop, 
C&gt;because it doesn't fit the degradatory stereotype that pop can represent 
C&gt;as well.  It's both, and pop arguments always get confusing that way.

(Drukman, in full armor, comes riding in on a white horse)

D&gt;Sure it does - verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/chorus ad infinitum.
D&gt;What's missing?  You can even HUM the tune.  Not to mention that 
D&gt;there's a dance remix, even.

(Cynthia glares at Drukman and exits stage left)

A&gt;Agreed, but RUTH fails at pop perfection.  In addition to the features
A&gt;you mention, the perfect pop song is less than 3 minutes long and has
A&gt;a long instrumental introduction and ending--so that the pop DJ's can
A&gt;talk over both the beginning and end of the song.

(from offstage)

W&gt;What you're describing is the traditional criteria for a hit single,
W&gt;not the definition of pop.

(Whitcomb enters wearing a tutu and a football helmet).

A&gt;RUTH has a long instrumental introduction, but ends with the "It's
A&gt;only good if you're running up that hill" chant.  I don't remember how
A&gt;long it is, but I think it's over 3 minutes.  The remix is about 5
A&gt;minutes as I remember, and has the chant at the beginning and the
A&gt;end--so it's kindof the anti-pop version of RUTH.

W&gt;Pop is generally accepted in the music business as music that doesn't
W&gt;fit into classical, international or jazz categories.  It's a very,
W&gt;very broad definition, and often the lines are blurred (jazz-rock
W&gt;fusion, for instance).  Unfortunately, the term has come to have a
W&gt;derogatory connotation.  As a result, pop music fans like to make up
W&gt;all kinds of silly definitions so that they can say music that they
W&gt;like isn't pop, but music that they don't like is.

(Cynthia rides across the stage on a unicycle, chortling loudly).

W&gt;The biggest confusion is between "bubblegum" and "pop" (probably
W&gt;because people pop bubblegum).  Yes, bubblegum is one flavor of pop
W&gt;(bubblegum flavor).

(Inspired, Andy pulls out a piece of gum and pops it in his mouth.)

W&gt;Then there is the music tagged as "power-pop", which is usually love
W&gt;songs featuring jangly guitars and strong hooks.  

(The horse stomps nervously and pins his ears back)

D&gt;Embrace POP!  Love your POP!  Personally, I have an extreme weakness
D&gt;for incredibly overproduced girlpop of the Fuzzbox or recent
D&gt;Propaganda ilk.  I might even admit to liking a few bananarama songs
D&gt;if you were to pump me full of drugs (somebody please volunteer).

(Faces Drukman:)

W&gt;You left out "worship POP", which better suits this group.

(Chewing thoughtfully:)

A&gt;Pop is like bubblegum--you stop chewing when you get tired of it.  It
A&gt;doesn't last.

(Spits out the gum.)

W&gt;Gee, yet another association of "pop" and "bubblegum".  Of course if
W&gt;you swallow bubblegum you might get an acid reaction.

(Looks around distractedly, as if waiting for StevO to appear).

A&gt;KaTe's music is like false teeth--you need them for long-term
A&gt;survival.

(Takes out his false teeth.)

W&gt;Somehow this doesn't seem a flattering comparison either.  It gets
W&gt;specially messy when you get bubblegum stuck in your false teeth.

D&gt;Nothing wrong with pop, as a basic concept.  It's just the purveyors of
D&gt;worthless, bland, cookie-cutter pop that need to die.

(The horse raises it's tail and loudly passes wind.  Drukman departs)

A&gt;I don't like the 3 minute rule, though.  

W&gt;Well, you shouldn't have made it up!

(Pouting:)

A&gt;I'd like all songs to be 5 minutes or longer--provided that the time
A&gt;is filled with substance, not just an extra long bridge.

(Andy departs)

(Calling after him:)

W&gt;Tell that to the Minutemen!  Ever hear the Resident's "Commercial
W&gt;Album"?  A song should end when the composer wants it to.  If the
W&gt;composer gets the message across in twenty seconds, fine.  Don't bore
W&gt;me with the chorus repeated umpteen times.  I personally like They
W&gt;Might Be Giant's self proclaimed song structure:  "First verse,
W&gt;second verse, chorus, weird middle section, chorus, let it end".

(Whitcomb removes his helmet)

W&gt;People like to make up rules and restrictions.  It gives structure to
W&gt;their worlds and provides justification for the existance of bureaucrats.
W&gt;One of the interesting things about pop music is that it is so broad.
W&gt;The only real rules are that it doesn't fall into the classical,
W&gt;ethnic or jazz category.  If it makes you cringe that Wilson Phillips
W&gt;and Kate Bush are in the same musical category, try counselling.

(Stage light dim.  Whitcomb paces thoughtfully.)

W&gt;Here are some sub-categories of pop that come to mind:

W&gt;Rock'n'roll, rock, hard rock, acid rock, art rock, bubblegum rock,
W&gt;industrial rock, progressive rock (I hate that term), alternative rock
W&gt;(that one too), soft rock, frat rock, comedy rock, noise rock,
W&gt;rockabilly, religious rock, folk rock, classic rock, dance rock, three
W&gt;chord rock, psychedelic rock, modern rock, post modern rock, glam
W&gt;rock, heavy metal, metal, speed metal, garage music, house music, club
W&gt;music, soul, rap, hip-hop, folk, punk, punkabilly, cowpunk, hardcore
W&gt;punk, chipmunk punk (a very small subcategory with only one album I
W&gt;know of), thrash punk, new wave, old wave, surf music, urban
W&gt;contemporary, adult contemporary, women's contemporary,
W&gt;militant-gay-marxist-fundimentalist-monk-drug-head contemporary (okey,
W&gt;I made that one up), blues, rhythm and blues, bluegrass, skiffle
W&gt;music, country, country western, western, power pop, synth pop,
W&gt;reggae, ska, calypso, Bulgarian speed polka (made that one up too)...

(To the audience:)

W&gt;I'm sure many of you could add to this list.  Note you won't find most
W&gt;of these listed in the Phonolog.  They will all be in the "Popular"
W&gt;section.  

(Whitcomb wipes his brow.  The stage is completely dark save for the
spotlight on him)

W&gt;So, you can quibble to your heart's content about which sub-genre you
W&gt;want to shoehorn Kate Bush's music into.  I'll settle for pop.

(Curtain)

(End of act one)
