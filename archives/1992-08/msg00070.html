In article &lt;63139@apple.Apple.COM&gt;, daemon@Apple.COM (Wizard's Assistant) writes:
&gt; There was one you missed, but I can't think of where it's from. Kate told
&gt; a story aobut Hannah being ill when kate was a small child. Hannah had
&gt; "died" and was having an out-of-body experience. She was up above her
&gt; body, looking down on herself, when Kate came into the room. That "forced"
&gt; her to re-enter her body and she was alive again. Now, even if people
&gt; don't believe in that sort of thing, obviously Hannah and Kate did, or
&gt; else Kate wouldn't have told the story. I wish I could remember where I
&gt; read it...

This was mentioned in "Illustrated Documentary" by Sean Mayes (and some
other guy whose name escapes me). I think the it went along these lines:

Hannah collapsed one day, and found herself at the ceiling looking down
at Kate's father trying to resuscitate(sp?) her. She called out, "Leave
me alone, I'm OK" (but nobody heard her, of course). When Kate came into
the room, she returned to her body. Apparently this incident influenced
"Watching You Without Me".

The question that springs to my mind is what did Hannah mean when she
said she was ok? Did she mean that she knew it was only temporary, and
she would be back, or did she mean that death wasn't a problem for her?
If it was the latter, that thought may be of some comfort to Kate and
her family right now.
