        As usual, I find that Kate says things better then I ever could: 


 
        WHAT'S BEEN THE LOWEST POINT IN YOUR LIFE? 
        In my life!  The worst moments are when I've lost people that have 
meant something to me, when people have died.  They're definitely the worst 
moments.  It's probably just the selfish feelings of why you miss a person.  
You want them to be with you again, you want them more and they're not 
there.  [MAKES OK SIGN]  Because probably where they've gone, they're really 
having a good time.  It you want to look at it, death, in a way, should be 
looked on as the greatest thing that's ever going to happen to you.   (1980, 
Profiles In Rock)

        DO YOU COME FROM A PARTICULARLY ARTISTIC FAMILY?
        Well, my mother's a dancer, she won a lot of prizes cleaning the 
floor with the opposition, and my father's a musician.  (1981, RM)

        I don't know if it was a dream or not, but I remember somebody 
looking over into my cot going something like "googgy wooogy woogy wooo".  I 
might have been one, maybe two years old.
        My father was a doctor and my mother a nurse.  Now she works on the 
phone for my father, taking calls.  (1982, Flexipop)

        PADDY, MAYBE YOU'D GIVE A QUICK SKETCH OF YOUR CAREER AS A MUSICIAN 
PRIOR TO YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH YOUR SISTER.
        PADDY: Well, I suppose it all started off initially because there's 
always been so much music in our family.  Our mother comes from a very 
musical family, all her brothers, i.e. our uncles, played on accordians and 
fiddles and stuff.  So music was something we were always exposed to as 
young kids and we were always hearing Irish dance music, which has been very 
special to me ever since.  (1985, Kate Bush Con)

        My mother's Irish and she always had relatives popping around, the 
vast majority of whom were superb musicians.  They'd come around and play 
accordions and things. (1989, Pulse)

        My mother, to whom I have always been very close also, was a muse.  
But my eye was almost always on what my father was up to.  Don't you think 
that, as a child, your aspirations are into the world?
        You take the whole domestic situation, including your mother, for 
granted.  Little did I know it was mum who was holding it all together.   
(1989, You)     

        An engineer we were working with picked out the line in 
"_And_Dream_of_Sheep_" that says "Come here with me now."  I asked him why 
he liked it so much.  He said, "I don't know, I just love it.  It's so 
moving and comforting."  I don't think he even knew what was being said 
exactly, but the song is about someone going to sleep in the water, where 
they're alone and frightened.  And they want to go to sleep, to get away 
from the situation.  But at the same time it's dangerous to go to sleep in 
water, you could drown.  When I was little, and I'd had a bad dream, I'd go 
into my parents' bedroom round to my mother's side of the bed.  She'd be 
asleep, and I wouldn't want to wake her, so I'd stand there and wait for her 
to sense my presence and wake up.  She always did, within minutes; and 
sometimes I'd frighten her - standing there still, in the darkness in my 
nightdress.  I'd say, "I've had a bad dream," and she'd lift bedclothes and 
say something like "Come here with me now."  It's my mother saying this line 
in the track, and I briefed her on the ideas behind it before she said it.  
And I think it's the motherly comfort that this engineer picked up on.  In 
fact, he said this was his favourite part of the album.   (1987, KBC 21)


        HANNAH: We always encouraged Kate to write songs, but we never 
thought, we never dreamed, it would all turn out like this.  We're very 
proud of her, naturally, but hasn't it all happened very suddenly?  The 
doorbell's ringing all the time now from fans who want autographs.  I have 
to collect them up and give them to Kate to sign.
        I worry about Kate at times, but she's a very stable girl and always 
seems to know what she's doing.  She hasn't become affected in the 
slightest.   (1978, Bush-Whacked!)


        HANNAH BUSH: [inaudible] Oh, in the show.  I like her in all of it 
actually, the quality, her performance, and her stamina.  

        HANNAH: Stamina, yes.  I mean her stamina is fantastic.  I mean she 
had to go on... We're very proud of that.  [Taps Kate on the shoulder] Very 
professional, uh huh, isn't she?   (1979, Kate Bush In Concert)
