Hi,
 
Glad to see Lovehounds is back in full glory. I tried to send this some time
ago but it bounced due to Lovehounds going down, I think. So...
 
The following small text appeared in the Haagsche Courant, 11 March 1994, on
the 'People' page, alongside a small 1" by 2" picture of Kate from the Whole
Story cover.
-------
KATE BUSH MISSES AWARD
 
Kate Bush doesn't qualify for a Brit Award (the English Grammy) for her
album 'The red shoes'. The reason is a change in the regulation. It was
decided that only records qualify that were released between 1 November 1992
and 31 October 1993.
Bush was exactly one day late. Not because her album was delayed, but
because her record company EMI had decided to couple the release of 'The red
shoes' with the release of the accompanying fifty minute film 'The line, the
cross, the curve'.
Ironically Kate was the inducement for the change in regulation. The jury
wants to avoid in future that artists without a record produced are being
nominated. Last year Bush was nominated for a Brit Award in the category
'best female vocal', whereas her album 'The sensual world' was released in
1989 already.
---------
 
...and there you have it.
Questions: (1) was 'TLTCTC' released? (2) Why did I buy The Red Shoes on
30 October? (3) Why is this 'fact' published now, when the awards were
already handed out ages ago?
Answers: (1) Nope. (2) Because the UK release date was different from the
European. (3) Eh... anyone?
 
Puzzledly yours,
