Glen talks about him finding a yet unknown Kate bootleg CD:
&gt;     So here's the scoop since I've never seen a listing for this cd.  Is it a
&gt; rare find?  (obviously its somewhat rare to ever find any 'boot' KB).
&gt; Title: Kate Bush - Shrubberies

It is new and as far as I know you're the first love-hound who's found that thing.
Right now I can count 16 Kate Bush bootleg CDs including this one.

&gt; Red Robin Records, no date anywhere, on the cd itself it has: KBCD 940111

'94...' is another indicator of it being new. Probably pressed on January 11, 1994.

&gt; It's a digipak (too bad) with a black n white cover of what appears to be

Digipack? Very good! (at least it's something special.)

&gt; about a 14-16 year old Kate singing into a mic with a bearded drummer with
&gt; very long hair behind her.  On the bass drum it says "The K.T. Bush
&gt; (Band)--you can't actually see the word Band.  It's got six full color photos
&gt; of KaTe on the inside panel (I've never seen any of them before).

I think the photos are what is the most interesting feature of that CD. I've
never even heard of a photo of the KT Bush Band live in action (at least if
you don't count the TV appearances that had the KT Bush Band as backing band
for Kate, for example Kate's very first TV appearance in Bio's Bahnhof).

&gt; So what's on it?  It's presumably demo recordings of just KaTe and her piano
&gt; for 22 songs and presumably the K.T. Bush Band for 4 songs (3.5 really).
&gt; The recording is fair to good for demos.  They're not lifted from an album as
&gt; there are no surface noises.  The piano demos are a better recording than the
&gt; 4 band ones.

Hmmm... Now the first 22 songs are the exact contents of the Alone At My Piano
bootleg CD. The other 4 songs do exist in a kind of band-version on the other
home demo recording bootlegs, so probably it's just them again. The running
times of the last four songs on the other CDs are

Babooshka: 1st version: 2:03, 2nd version: 1:57. The 2nd version is basically the
    same as the 1st version with some cheap drum pattern programmed over it.
    This drum machine (dap-dap-dap-dip, dap-dap-dap-dip, ...) is supposed to be
    'programmed' by David Gilmour.
Moving: 2:41
Don't push...: 2:53
Kite: 2:45

If on the new CD they are within a +-5 sec range of these values they are probably
the same.

&gt; I was so excited about all this, I haven't even listened to the whole thing
&gt; yet-- I had to come over to post this.  A must for colleKTors.

Surely! The first specially-packaged Kate CD bootleg.

&gt; So experts (Uli, Chris n Vickie, Andy, etc.), is this a cd from an album
&gt; (maybe Alone at Her Piano? which I've never seen) or what?

*blush!* me listed first in that row of famous love-hounds... I'm not worthy!!! ;-)

Right, most of it is the same stuff that is on the Alone At Her Piano CD, though
two or three tracks run under different titles (remember that the titles are
not confirmed in any way, so both are equally correct and wrong at the same time).

&gt; The same store also had another KB boot cd called, B Sides.  I'd never seen
&gt; this one before either but it seemed to have all songs that are now available on
&gt; TWW box set (which I already have).  Can anybody confirm this?

If 'B Sides' means 'Back Sides' then you are right. If not then you've found
something else that's new. (Back Sides has a white cover with a black/white
picture of Kate sitting at a piano, track listing: December wbma, Warm and
Soothing, Ran Tan Waltz, Full House, The Empty Bullring, Burning Bridge, Not This
Time, The Handsome Cabin Boy, Under The Ivy, The Big Sky (Meteorological [sic]
mix).)

Bye,

Uli
