       Rec.music.gaffa readers: To cut down on a super-long Digest,
       I've just posted SIGs 121 through 129 in rec.music.misc only.
       If you're interested in seeing them, look for the subject
       line "Vickie's playlists-Updating Suspended In Gaffa/Kansas City"
       Sorry, but most of the flack I got came from those who only
       got the Digests and those people would really be mad if they
       suddenly got over a dozen playlists at one time! Since I'll
       be posting them regularly again from now on, I'll spare them
       all the Kansas City shows this time. If you're only on the
       Mailing List and actually WANT the KC list, e-mail me and I'll
       send it to you.


Vickie here. Now for my Chicago shows. In a way these are easier because
I'm starting from scratch and can play anything I want, not having to
worry about how many times I've played it in the past or when was the
last time. Then again, it's harder because I feel that WZRD's listeners
have already heard EVERYTHING and I can't possibly suprise them. I also
feel that I should keep away from anything even slightly mainstream.
WZRD is 1000 times more alternative than KKFI and there are artists
that I wouldn't feel comfortable playing. All I can do is do my best and
that's all I can do. Sharp eyes will notice a lot of songs that appeared
on my recent Kansas City playlists. I confess to a certain amount of
laziness and also think that good songs in neat segues can be repeated.
Only you know the truth. :-) Onward....

That's it. The playlists are all up to date now. I think all of the above
artist/groups have been discussed at one time or another in either .gaffa
or .misc so I won't add anything.

Wait. Rodeo Riot hasn't been mentioned. They're a local Chicago group sadly
no longer together. It's country swing very influenced by k.d.lang. This is
a great song about a woman who loves to party, never mind that she has to
get up and go to work at 6am! Fun song!
