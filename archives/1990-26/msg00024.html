&gt;	Well yes and no! If you mean the pickups to be 6 or 7 small round

&gt;the body of the guitar, then there should be only 6 and that would mean a 
&gt;six string guitar. (If there are 7, and I doubt it, then that would mean a 
&gt;7 string, yes they do exist but are uncommon.) 
&gt;	Here are some pickup types reply to which is most likely:-

&gt;	I assume the "pickups" you talk about are the magnets as described 
&gt;above. I don't think there would be 6 or 7 pickups on the guitar!

  *Blush!* Yeah, thats what I meant.  I'm not *too* knowledgeable on
guitars!  Anyway, it looks as though we have the guitar type nailed
down now.

&gt;4&gt; Also Who is holding/playing the guitar?

  I don't know about this one - in fact does anyone know who played in
the KT Bush Band?  I think we all know the singer ;-), but all my
references are pretty vague about the actual band members ('friends of
Paddy' etc).  The guitarist has light hair, not too long.
