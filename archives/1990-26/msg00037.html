For myself, I like to listen to progressive rock in the background (or
in the foreground).  A lot of people can't study to such things or to
music at all, but here are some suggestions with comments on how much
vocals are involved:

Yes - Tales From Topographic Oceans (has some vocals but mainly lengthy
	instrumental pieces, very complex music, mainly rock with some
	wierdness thrown in)

King Crimson - various but notably Lizard (which has some vocals but the
	title track is a 20 minute piece with lots of jazzy instrumental
	passages)

Pat Metheny Group - no vocals at all.  Some of their later stuff (like
	First Circle, Still Life Talking) is very melodic yet good for
	background.

National Health (never heard of them you say??) - an excellent jazz/rock
	group with very very little vocals and great complex musical
	schemes interspersed with solos by keyboards, horns and guitars.
	A disc entitled National Health Complete was just released which
	features all 3 of their albums on 2 CDs, definitely worth getting
	if you like complex rock/jazz music.

Frank Zappa (seriously) has a some really good jazz music for background,
	namely Grand Wazoo and Waka/Jawaka.  Also Hot Rats for the
	most part.  Another good one is You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore
	Volume II in parts as much of this is instrumental although the
	vocal parts might cause you to lose your train of thought!!

Andreas Vollenweider - Down to the Moon, pretty good for newage.

Michael Oldfield - Tubular Bells.

Just a few suggestions for you.
