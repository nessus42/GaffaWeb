Last-modified: 1995/08/26
Version: 1.3.q minus 1.3.n

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action.  The full version is posted to
rec.music.gaffa only.  You can get a full copy of the FAQ by requesting it from
me (uli@zoodle.robin.de).  If you subscribe to the list (done by sending
email to love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net) Bill Wisner will also provide you
with the full FAQ.  If you can't receive more than 64KB in one piece I can
split the FAQ for you.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.  Cosmetical changes aren't listed.

         [see also 4.4.]

[A completely new section, thanks to stev0 for the words, let's see how
it works.  I'll try to post this section more often. No promises to the
regularity of this though.]

2.1. Who is Happy Rhodes?

     To post a message send it to

        ecto@nsmx.rutgers.edu.

[slight change in address was forgotten at this spot previously]

     Postage and handling is 2.00 for the first and 0.50 for each additional
     CD.  Postage to Europe is 3.50 (1 CD), 4.35 (2 CDs), 6.00 (3 CDs),

        Happy Rhodes
        c/o Aural Gratification
        P.O. Box 380
        Bearsville, NY 12409
        USA
        auralg@aol.com

[adjustment to reality in AG's email address...]

2.2. Who is Tori Amos?

     Tori Amos and her music, and anything else that seems relevant.  Due
     to the heavy load of discussion and members after the release of Tori's
     new album, Under The Pink, Anthony was forced to make the list digest-
     only, that is there is no bounce mail.  Watch out for limited editions of
     Tori's singles, since they ARE limited and the first UtP one, Cornflake
     Girl, was quite fast sold out completely.

[removed sentence "A massive world tour has ended right now". This 'right now'
was December last year...]

3.3. What is Katemas?

     In 1995 there were parties in Chicago (Illinois), Boonton (New Jersey),
     Portland (Oregon), Gwynneville (Wollongong, Australia), Hamilton (New
     Zealand), West Beach (Adelaide, South Australia), Belchertown
     (Massachusetts), Boston (Massachusetts), Glastonbury Tor (England), San
     Francisco (California), Toronto (Ontario, Canada).

[Actual sites for 1995]

     Who else shares Kate's birthday?

        Emily Bronte (1818, author of the novel 'Wuthering Heights')
        Paul Anka
        William Atherton
        Peter Bogdanovich
        Delta Burke
        Ken Olin
        Arnold Schwarzenegger (actor)

[new list, anyone else? Any years? Any professions? I remember that I've
posted a much longer list a couple of years ago, but I cannot find it anymore.]

4.4. Basic Discography/Videography

     Other official video tapes/laserdiscs which contain some Kate not
     available on her own tapes (some are PAL only):

     Comic Strip Classics - The Strike / GLC (1995):
        This video tape contains two episodes of the series 'The Comic Strip
        presents...', the second one (GLC) contains several Kate Bush songs:
        Ken, The Confrontation, One Last Look Around The House Before We Go,
        Running Up That Hill (Extended Version), as well as several unnamed
        short pieces of music written and performed by Kate.

[new addition]

     Kate appeared in a few films' soundtracks, which are listed here:

     - The Comic Strip Presents... GLC - The Carnage Continues
       features Kate's songs Ken, The Confrontation, One Last Look Around The
       House Before We Go, and Running Up That Hill (Extended Version)
       as well as a couple of other unnamed short musical bits.  All are
       available on CD except for the unnamed ones.  This episode now is
       available on commercial video tape.
     - The Comic Strip Presents... Les Dogs (1990)
       doesn't feature Kate singing, but rather Kate acting.  This was Kate's
       first role as an actress, The Line, The Cross, and The Curve being her
       second one.
     - The Comic Strip Presents... Wild Turkey (Christmas Special 1992)
       features Kate's song Home For Christmas, now finally available on CD.

[tidied up the Comic Strip Presents... references. Why didn't anyone hit me
for not mentioning 'extended version' for Running Up That Hill before? ;-).
Les Dogs is completely new here. Why did I forget it before?]

     Not mentioned are films where a Kate track just runs accidentally long
     after its regular release (e.g. some of MTV's "The Real World" series,
     or the Miami Vice episode featuring Hello Earth).

[reference to Miami Vice is new]

4.5. Other Artists using Kate's Work

     The Man With The Child In His Eyes
        Xu Ru Yun - ?
            (Mandarin version, called '100 Lies') [DC]

[new entry]

5.5. The Dreaming

     Leave It Open:
        The 'backwards' lyrics at the end of the song aren't really backwards.
        They've been recorded backwards, but they are pretty much straight
        forward and say "we let the wierdness in".  Kate listened to the
        phrase backwards and tried to sing what she heard, which then was
        played backwards again - resulting in a wierd sounding forward phrase.
        On the other hand, you can hear something backwards as well: "And they
        said they won't let me in" (this isn't official, while the forward
        phrase is - it was a long unanswered quiz question in the KBC).

[if it's a RFAQ, it has to be an FAQ as well, doesn't it?]

5.9. Miscellaneous

     Fruitopia Commercials
        Kate did the music for nine commericials only seen on American TV
        for Fruitopia, a line of fruit drinks produced by Minute Maid (which
        is a subsidiary of the Coca-Cola company).  There was also a longer
        advertisement seen in movie theatres which Kate also did the music
        for.  Another series of Fruitopia Commercials just started, the
        first one being spotted during a commercial break of the '95 Academy
        Awards show.  The British versions of the Fruitopia commercials don't
        contain Kate's music, but rather Elisabeth Fraser from the Cocteau
        Twins.

[added stuff about the British versions of the commercials - and forgot to
mention the price the commercials got on SIGGRAPH. Next time...]
