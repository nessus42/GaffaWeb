Greets.

A couple of 'Kate spots' in this month's 'Q' magazine.  Details follow.

Firstly the free tape on the cover features R.U.T.H., amoungst some
other rather good tracks.  The tape is entitled "Drive!  An hour of
cruisin' classics".  Inside the cover a small photo of Her Kateness and
a few words :

     3 KATE BUSH Running Up That Hill

     Aside from her breakthrough effort, Wuthering Heights, this
     intoxicatingly rhythmic beauty from August 1985 was Bush's most
     successful single, as well as her most significant, signalling a new
     complexity and maturity for the already prodigious talent.  According
     to the astonishing lyric, she wished to swap places with no less than
     God.  Pushing things a tad, even for Kate.  A wizardette, a true star.

     3(UK) 30(US)


No comment ;)


And a little later on in the magazine, in the news section.

     Sir Cliff Richard, Kate Bush, Lisa Stansfield, Sting, Elton John, Pet
     Shop Boys and Seal have signed a leather-bound edition of The Guinness
     Book Of Hit Singles to be auctioned by Sotheby's on September 13 and
     14, celebrating the publication's 10th edition.  Proceeds to The
     Terrence Higgins Trust, Lord's Taverners and Roy Castle Cancer Appeal.


Wait, there's more.

'Q' asked readers to write and tell them about records that changed
their lives.  Kate, of course, got a mention.

     DAVID MAYALL Rochdale
     Kate Bush The Hounds Of Love

     Studying for accountancy exams in the summer of 1990, 25-year-old David
     Mayall was getting himself in a panic.  It's the night before the exam,
     and he has avoided all notions of study for much of the year, and so is
     in the midst of a desperate all-night cram.  Cole's Notes on
     Corporation Supertax staring him the face, he devises a plan.  "I
     decided I would have a blitz for half an hour or so and then completely
     freak out to some very loud music for 10 minutes to help bash it into
     my brain."  The track he chose was Kate Bush's The Hounds Of Love,
     mainly because "the howl in the chorus just seemed to work for me at
     the time".  Every half an hour, he would take to his balcony and let
     rip.  It worked.  He passed.  It changed his life.  "Unfortuantly.  So
     I've got a very dull job now.  Thanks a bunch, Kate."


Well, that's it.  Blame typos on 'Q', except for mine :)

Until next time....


Love and hugs :-x
