Ed says:
&gt; [Ron says:]
&gt;
&gt;&gt;[K:]  So it was really designing something that was a
&gt;&gt;cross between an Akatan [???] gun and a pipe organ.
&gt;
&gt;She used the British term for an anti-aircraft gun, whatever it is.
&gt;

ack-ack gun.  from the noise it makes.

BTW, the designer who had worked on _Alien_ was (as most of you know)
H.R. Giger, a german artist with reclusive habits and a tendency to
use real animal parts in his scultures.  Mr. Giger also designed the
poster that got the Dead Kennedies brought up on obscenity charges...

&gt;&gt;[K:]  In fact, the only well filmed piece
&gt;&gt;of dance I think I've ever seen was [?anybody know who she's talking about
&gt;&gt;here???] and I think that's because she was so involved in it that it was so
&gt;&gt;good.
&gt;
&gt;Kate says, "Twyla Tharp's 'Catherine Wheel'."  It took me a while to
&gt;figure this out, too!  "The Catherine Wheel" had music by David Byrne,
&gt;and, as Kate says, choreography by Twyla Tharp.
&gt;

the album from "The Catherine Wheel" is a favorite of mine;  IM-never-
very-HO, this is the best work David Byrne ever did.  of course, he is
greatly assisted by Eno, Adrian Belew, David Van Tiegham, etc.  i didn't
know that there was a film -- i'll have to go track it down...

many thanks to Ron and all for the interviews!  i'd love to see an
interview-ography, at least an index for those interviews in the archives;
though maybe i should wait 'til Ron's Cloudbusting project is on line...

footah!
