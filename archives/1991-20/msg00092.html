&gt;From article &lt;9106131229.AA27935@EDDIE.MIT.EDU&gt;, by JONES@RPIECS.BITNET:
&gt; Hello there fellow Love-Hounds--
&gt;   Here's a quick suggestion to you GIF gods out there:  can you
&gt; possibly find a good shot of Kate from the Delius video, and make
&gt; a GIF file from it?  I seem to remember that there was a photo in
&gt; _Kate_Bush_Complete, although I think it was fairly small.  This
&gt; piece would make a nice addition to any GIFfer's KollecTion.
&gt;   Just my two cents' worth for the time being...

It sure is a shame that Delius was never included in any of the
collections. &lt;sigh&gt;

I'm not one of the actual GIF producers but I've talked to Ken about
how he does his.  Unfortunately I'd say that it would be almost
impossible to get a good pic from the Delius video unless someone has
a _very_ early generation copy of it.  

The first problem you have to contend with is motion blur.  Even if
you have a perfect copy many frames will have motion blur unless the
subject is standing very still (not likely in the Delius video).

Next you have the problem of video itself. VHS resolution just isn't 
good enough to make great still picture.  Add to that the fact that
these videos have lost resolution with each generation and you won't
get anything good from the video.

I think I read somewhere that while PAL format TV is higher resolution
that NTSC, PAL VHS videos have lower resolution than NTSC, somewhere
between the what we know as SP and LP here in the states.  So the
source may have been poor to begin with.

Ken could explain his process for stills better than I but I believe
he had a rough time with pics as small as those in the _This Woman's
Work_ CD booklet and I don't think the Delius picture in _Kate Bush
Complete_ is as clear as those.

Ken?
