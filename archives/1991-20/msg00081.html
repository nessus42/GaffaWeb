    28. Saturday Morning Show: Kate is interviewed about Faith Brown's parody
of Wuthering Heights, (w/Brown video), early 1979 (?). I have only seen part
of this clip. In it Kate chats briefly with a polite male interviewer, then
watches as Brown's parody of the Rockflix video (see entry number 2) is shown,
and expresses her admiration for Brown afterward.

[Transcribed by Ronald Hill, above note by IED.]

[Wow is played]

        I: Is indeed wow and welcome to Kate Bush.  Want to get more of that,
you'll have to go out and buy it, right? 

        K: Yeah, I guess so. 

        I: We've seen a tremendous amount of you on television, of course, in
the last twelve months, but you're about to escape the television studio and
the recording studio and undertake your first major British tour, aren't you? 
Are you at all apprehensive about it? 

        K: Oh, yeah.  Very, very indeed.  But I'm very exited as well.  It's
something very new for me and it's something that I've always wanted to do, so
it's great.

        I: What sort of performance, what sort of show, can the audience
expect to see, without giving to much away, of course. 

        K: Well, [makes mumbling sounds with hand over mouth.  Both Laugh] I
can't say much except that it's just a concept of my music really.  And that
we're just gonna try and present something visually.

        I: We can expect it to be theatrical anyway, I think?  

        K: [Slightly abrupt] Well, we'll see. 

        I: Right.  It's not the first time of course that you've been in front
of a big audience.  The first time in this country, but you were in - was it
in Japan, or Hong Kong, or Tokyo?  Were was it last year, the big film, the
big festival.  Tokyo wasn't it?

        K: Yeah, Tokyo.  

        I: Where you got the silver award.  And that was in front of a vast
audience, wasn't it? 

        K: Yeah, there were a lot of people, yeah. 

        I: Did you enjoy that? 

        K: Yes, I did.  It was a fantastic experience. 

        I: How did they organize they organize those international song 
festivals, I've never been to one.  Is it at all like the Eurovision song
contest, as we know it? 

        K: Well, I wouldn't be able to compare because it's the first thing
I've done like that.  But the amount of organization was phenomenal, because
there was so many artists involved.  And it was in a very big hall, with a
live orchestra, and the preparation must have been incredible.

        I: Yeah, but you had a good time anyway?

        K: Yeah. 

        I: The single, which we've just seen you performing there, comes your
latest album here.  [Shows album with light bouncing off of it] Hope it
doesn't flare to much.  [Kate Laughs]  Which is Lionheart of course.  That's
the second single from there, and your first two hit  singles came from The
Kick Inside, which is your debut album as well.  What's your own personal
feelings, apposed to maybe your record companies idea, of talking singles from
LPs.  Do you think the record company actually a tremendously fair deal by
that?  [Note - In many countries outside the U.S., Britain included, it wasn't
common practice until the 70s to release songs on both albums and singles. 
For instance, many of the Beatles hits were never originally on albums in
Britain.]

        K: Well that's something that, generally, I don't really know about.
[Kate smoothly changes the subject, slightly!]  But I know in my case that I
do have certain ideas of the songs that I want to come out and I put that to
the record company, and they think about it, and obviously they have things
they want to put out, and we come to an agreement.  [Hate to keep barging in,
but note, that in every documented case, the company comes to agree with
Kate's idea, and not the other way around!]

        I: You come to an agreement between yourselves?

        K: Yeah.

        I: And of course Wuthering Heights was the record which really kicked
it all off for you, about a year ago.  There was a tremendous parody of that
done by Faith Brown, which we are going to see in just a moment.   Did you
enjoy that when you saw it?

        K: Yes, I thought it was incredible.  I think she's a genius. 

        I: Alright, lets look at it again over here. 

[Faith Brown's Wuthering Heights parody is played.  Audience laughs.]

        K: Amazing. 

        I: Yes, you had a smile at that?  How did the technique, your own
technique, actually evolve?  The one that is being parodied there by Faith
Brown, who in fact is a guest in a couple of weeks.

        K: I'd just like to say that I think the amount of research [that] she
must have done.  I mean, she must have watched that video so many times,
because the movements are just... they're betting than mine, you know, even
when she falls over, it's great.  
        But that happened, really, through meeting a man called Lindsey Kemp,
who was very theatrical, and a mime artist.  And he just turned me on to the
idea of movement being extremely expressive and that's what I try to do, I try
to get the movement [??? in place?]

        I: You're about to go out on a concert tour of theatres.   But a lot
of ladies, sometime in there career, get pushed towards the glamour end of the
market, the cabaret circuit.  Does that thought abhor you at all? 

        K: Yes. 

        I: Or appall you I should say. 

        K: Yes, I'm really not into cabaret, I must admit.

        I: No.  So what's new in 1979 after the tour, another album
presumably.

        K: Yes, and I've gotta write the songs.

        I: Great.

        K: So that's going to take some time.

        I: Well thank you for taking time out to join us this morning, Kate. 
All the best with the concerts, at the Palladium.  I hope to see your there. 
Alright? 

        K: Thank you.

        I: Smashing, thank you very much indeed. 

        K: Take care.  
        
        I: I will.
