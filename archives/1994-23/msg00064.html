Hi!

Well, the San Francisco '94 Katemas party was the best one yet!  Critics
agree:  Chris did an excellent bang-up wonderful job on the Lovehounds tape.

My only suggestion:  Adding in the opening titles:  "In Stereo Surround-sound
(where available)".

Folks at the party:  The guests included Wolfman, Dracula and his son...

Oh, no that's ANOTHER party.  Actually, Bill, our pseudo-humble pseduo-
moderator was there, as was IED, and the surprise guest of the evening,
Peter Manchester.

Highlights included me handing out the award-winning Lovehounds T-shirt
(Commercial time:  I still have some Large T-shirts left.  Email me if
interested.  That's large ONLY - sorry, sold out of everything else).

Also, IED threw up

(Damn editor, let's try that again) IED threw up a quickie spontaneous
min-Jeopardy game.  After I swept one catagory (My favorite topic:  Food)
it quickly turned into The Rest of The Room against me.  I came in second
(barely - if I answered the last question, I would have won).

We all had a great time watching every wonderful second of the wonderful
Nightflight unedited interview (With Bill Wisner in the role of Tom
Servo and me as Crow).  Running gag:  Ask Peter Manchester which Kate
song it is which goes, "Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!"

We also watched a couple of Fruitopia ads over and over and over and over
again (Gee, thanks, IED).  I'm still skeptical over whether it's Kate or
not.  But if William S. Burroughs is advertising sneakers, ANYTHING can
happen.

We had splendid food (Karen did a wonderful four-star job) - a huge
cake, a slightly smaller cake (or is that KaKe?), Kit-Kat bars (Yeah!),
and a giant ham (appropriate, even though She is a vegetarian, when
watching the K**f-directed videos).  Which reminds me, Bill is adding
a shell script to Lovehounds which deletes any mention of that K-person.
You can still say "fuck", "piss", and even "M-cros-ft" (the last word
semi-censored because some words even *I* find offensive!), but no
mentioning of K--f.

Door prizes where handed out to everyone (I got a Red Shoes mini-poster
and a tape of the Hammersmith concert - the real McCoy, NOT a copy!)
These were (for the most part) NOT cheap prizes!  (Although they had a
hard time getting anyone to take the dead-bird-on-head copy of Pulse!)

Everyone had a swell time, and again, thanks to all of those folks who
made it a smashing success.

Which brings up a question everyone always ignores when I ask, but I'll
try again, anyway:

When are we going to have a Kate KonvenTion in AmeriKa?
