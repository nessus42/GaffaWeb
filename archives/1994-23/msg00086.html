I missed this when it first came out, and I don't remember seeing
any mention of it on this newsgroup.  Please forgive me if I'm
wrong.  But an earlier issue of People Magazine (Jan. 24, I believe)
had a review of _The Red Shoes_, as well as a short interview!

Review:  

THE RED SHOES
Kate Bush

       British-born Kate Bush, perhaps the queen of ethereal pop, has been
spinning exotic rhythms and esoteric lyrics into space for 15 years.
Which is great if you want a huge cult following.  But what if you also 
want listeners closer to the mainstream?  Simple.  You make _The Red Shoes_.
       This is the best and most conventional of all Bush's albums and 
even includes a couple of potential Top 40 singles: the happy-skippy
dance number "Rubberband Girl" {well, it got into the 90s} and the
Prince-like "Why Should I Love You?" {nope} (which features {Prince
symbol}, the Human Hieroglyphic himself, on keyboards).  There are still
plenty of unique twists and turns to Bush's music, however, and on the
title cut, a mandolin, some whistles and a tidal wave of vocal overdubs
come close to aural theater.
       The one constant that will both appease the Kate cult and entice
new fans is Bush's voice.  She coos.  She sighs.  She seduces.  Her soft
and sensual vocals have always cast a siren-like spell, and on this
outing the magic feels to good to resist.  (Columbia)

Interview:

Talking With...Kate Bush
ENDING THE ISOLATION
       "People tell me they feel it's quicker and easier to get into this
record than some of my others," Kate Bush says of her new CD, _The Red
Shoes_.  "From the beginning, I wanted to make this an album of songs
rather than a concept album.  I wanted a more straightforward approach,
to not be so experimental with my arrangements."
       After tasting success with her lush 1978 debut single, "Wuthering
Heights," the 35-year-old vocalist has dabbled in straight-ahead rock,
breathy ballads and even world music.  Until now, most of her recording
was done alone, with accompanists laying down their tracks separately.
This time Bush avoided that isolation by spending the past 2 1/2 years
working with other artists at her home studio, a process that gave the 
disc more spontneity.
       "I work in a very contained environment, usually," she explains.
"So I took more of a band approach to the tracks this time.  To actually
work with human beings again was wonderful."
       Some of those humans were Eric Clapton, Prince, and ex-Procol Harum
keyboardist Gary Brooker.  Each was invited to play on a _Red Shoes_ song
for which Bush felt they were particularly suited.
       "My guitarist [Alan Murphy] died a few years ago," she says.  
"Rather than look for a replacement, I went the other way and thought about
who would be my ideal person on each track.  It was interesting how
quickly they responded.  I was very flattered that they'd be so positive
about working with me."
       Famous names lending a hand on a few songs.  Songs that have plenty
of hit potential. {Sure}  Even rumors of a concert tour, her first since
1979.  {Heh-heh-heh}  Can a beer commercial be far behind?  Don't count
on it. {Fruitopia, maybe?}  "It's not my ambition to be a big star," she
says.  "I'm just lucky to do what I like for a living.  That's all."
       -- C.T.
