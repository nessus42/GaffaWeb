Here's the interview excerpt from last Thurdsay's Post Modern
Show on MTV.  The words "KATE BUSH ON: SUDDEN FAME" appear on
a black background.  You hear Kate talking.  In a couple of
seconds, this shot fades and you see Kate against a blank
wall.  She says:

     "Everything was so different.  I had a life that was no longer that.
In fact, I was really taken away from making music, which was a very
hard thing to come to terms with.  I was spending more of my time doing
interviews, promoting, traveling, doing televisions, and I started
thinking, you know, hang on, I'm doing this instead of making music,
but what I want to be doing is making music.  So I kind of had to take
a hold of that and reverse the whole situation so that most time is
being spent creatively, and then the promotional work back that up at
a later point."

I have a puzzle for you.  Where was the following poem published?

What could be worse than losing someone you love?
They are both losing each other,
Both trying to make it easier for each other.
A mother and daughter with so much courage and love,
It hurts just to read it.
But you should.
					-- Kate Bush

(My apologies if this poem has been discussed previously in .gaffa.
If it has been, it was before my time.)
