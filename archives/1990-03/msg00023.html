 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: CBS Kate Bush video details; _Billboard_ charts

     The horror-story dialogue posted yesterday by another
Love-Hound intrepid enough to call CBS about their new KT video
was very familiar to IED, who probably had spoken to the same
arrogant and unhelpful CBS rep the day before. It won't come
as a surprise to anyone that considerably more specific information
about Kate's video has already turned up in _Billboard_ this week,
no doubt through no help from the jerks who staff CBS's
telephones, but rather through the cooperation of real insiders
(i.e., the CBS staffers who actually plan, program, design, do layout
for and market the product).
     Kate's _The_Sensual_World_:_The_Videos_ will be out on February
13th. It'll be the first in what CBS hopes will be a major new series
of home-video releases designed for "impulse purchase" at low prices
($9.98 to $12.98). All will have three or four videos, and, where
possible, additional material like an interview with the artist(s).
The idea is to strike while the album is still hot, so to speak. There
are hopes that these inexpensive, current video packages will be placed
by the video-stores' checkout counters, luring the customers with their
already-familiar cover designs.
     _The_Sensual_World:_The_Videos_ will contain the videos of:
_The_Sensual_World_, _Love_and_Anger_ and _This_Woman's_Work_, PLUS
excerpts from a video interview which originally appeared as part
of VH-1's recent half-hour special on Kate.
     The video's artwork will be the same as the album's.
     In other news, the album has risen _back_ up the _Billboard_ hot 100
LPs chart, from No. 48 to No. 46, with a bullet. Also, although _Love_
_and_Anger_ fell from No. 2 to No. 17 this week on the Modern Rock Tracks
chart, a new _single_ (Ed Suranyi, ever the observanT reKorder, has noted
that the song has its own Columbia catalogue number now, implying that it
will soon appear in stores as a follow-up single to _Love_and_Anger_) of
_The_Sensual_World_ _rose_ ten places, from No. 18 to No. 8.
     Still no sign of _Love_and_Anger_ on the Billboard singles chart,
however, nor of _The_Sensual_World_. Finally, the video of _Love_and_
_Anger_ no longer appears on MTV's "Buzz Bin" list, nor on any other
MTV video playlist. VH-1, however, has _The_Sensual_World_ video
on their "Adds" list this week--so keep your VCRs tuned!
