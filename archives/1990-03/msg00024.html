Vickie here. 

Larry doth write:

&gt;Did anyone else see the interruption of the "Love and Anger" video
&gt;at 11:25 PM CDT Thursday night on MTV?  Kate was standing in front of
&gt;the line of dancers, and suddenly a big skull and crossbones with the 
&gt;caption "PIRATE TV" appeared instead.  There was maniacal laughter for
&gt;about five seconds, then it reverted to the LaA video.  I am not
&gt;kidding!

Yes, I saw it too and I was hopping mad!!

&gt;Was this:

&gt;1) A cheap MTV stunt?  If so, I would think Kate would be
     pissed at her video being "violated" like this. 

I found out today that a new series is premiering on MTV called
"Pirate TV". I saw that same logo in their ad. I'm so mad that they
chose Kate to "cut in on" that my first reaction is to say I'll
never watch that show, but I have to give it at least one chance.
Even though they're dumbshits and defiled Our Lady's video, they
just might come up with some very good and obscure videos. Don't
worry, I'm not going to hold my breath or anything. I didn't catch
the premier date 'cause I was too busy yelling at Chris "HEY LOOK!!
THOSE ARE THE JERKS THAT CUT IN ON KATE!!! WHAT A BUNCH OF MORONS!!!
By the time I calmed down and realized that a thing call Pirate TV
might (maybe could be who knows you never know we'll see I doubt it
but it's worth a peek)be interesting, uh well,the ad was over. 
And go it sos
