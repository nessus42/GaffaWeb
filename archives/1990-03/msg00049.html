		Positive Female Energy

	Four years. Is it really that long since Hounds of Love?
	Len Brown asks Kate Bush why.

"I find it extraordinary that people should want to write about me when I do
so little. I just pop out and do an album and go away again."
Kate Bush doesn't really behave like your average pop star. While most
performers, addicted to the limelight, either rush out records at regular
intervals and/or court publicity in the popular media, Bush goes out of her
way to avoid attention. "Reclusive" seems something of an understatement.

"It's healthier for me not to indulge in being a famous person," she
explains, quietly. "It's ridiculous, there's absolutely no reason why I
should be at all, other than I make records."

And they're increasingly infrequent too. Tears For Fears may have spent the
last couple of years struggling with their art in the studio but Orzabal and
Smith seem almost prolific by comparison with Kate. It's been four years
since the critically acclaimed Hounds of Love adventure and that followed
cold on the heels of The Dreaming three years earlier.

But now The Sensual World is with us, complete with successful title-track
single, and it seems that however much she likes to distance herself from
the business, Kate Bush's music still returns to challenge and provoke and
rise above the tide of mediocrity.

Violinist Nigel Kennedy, who appears on the new release, recently described
Kate Bush as one of the few geniuses in modern music. And certainly, looking
at past and present creations, there's a sense of timelessness about her
music; she doesn't second guess the public or depend on what's fashionable
at any particular moment in time.

"I found the writing very difficult on this," she admits candidly. "I didn't
know what I wanted to say or how to treat the songs and make them sound
differently; whether to get outside musicians in to do something or just go
away and think. A lot of it is jigsawing. I'd get to the point where I
couldn't write, where I was sick of the songs. The problem is holding on to
that energy level.

She speaks without arrogance, almost without confidence. The business of
promoting and publicising her art is something she finds embarrassingly
difficult.

"I don't really see myself as a performer and that's hard for me when I have
to come out and expose myself and be the saleswoman of the hour. I've been
almost me for the last couple of years, but in the last two weeks I've been
aware of people treating me as what seems to be a very famous person. It's
totally surreal, going into an isolated way of working three or four years
at a time, then coming out and having everyone looking at you as if they
know you."

Sometimes it's hard to reconcile this small, henna-haired 30 year-old with
the received images of Kate Bush; the marketed blend of eroticism and
innocence that helped rocket her to fame in the late 70's and early 80's,
through the likes of Wuthering Heights, Wow, Babooshka, Army Dreamers, and
Breathing. Her reputation from the remarkable Kick Inside debut through to
1982's The Dreaming was built not only on original compositions but also her
presentation as a theatrical performer.

But, in the decade after she last performed live, Kate Bush has grown up and
away from girlie things. The Hounds of Love saw her developing lyrically,
musically and technologically, particularly with it's intriguing "Ninth
Wave" concept second-half. And while The Sensual World in many ways is built
firmly on rootsy contributions from Celtic musicians such as Davy Spillane
and Alan Stivell (plus the extraordinary vocal harmonies of Trio Bulgarka),
it's naturally an even more mature creation than what's gone before.

"Someone said that in the teens you get physical puberty and between 28 and
32 mental puberty," she suggests. "Let's face it you've got to start
growing up when you're 30. It does make you feel differently. I feel very
positive having gone through the last couple of years."

According to Kate, now in complete charge of her projects (aided by
long-term intimate Del Palmer and multi-instrumentalist brother Paddy), The
Sensual World contains "the most positive female energy" in her work to
date. It's a belief born out in the title track which was inspired by Molly
Bloom's very erotic and sensual stream of consciousness in James Joyce's
Ulysses: "Mmh, yes/ Then I'd take the kiss of seedcake back from his mouth/
Going deep South, go down, mmh, yes."

"It's the idea of Molly escaping from the author, out into the real world,
being the real human rather than the character, "stepping out of the page
into the sensual world".

It reflects Bush's own sense of maturity, her growing freedom from the limits
imposed on her early work by inexperience, lack of confidence, ignorance and
available technology. Tracks like Deeper Understanding and The Fog
illustrate this development; the idea that Kate Bush no longer wishes to be
seen as a child but regarded as a serious woman artist. And perhaps she's
trying to convince herself at the same time. In The Fog her father, Dr. John
Bush, tells her: "just put your feet down child/ cos you're all grown up
now".

"Growing up for most people is just trying to stop escaping," suggests Kate,
"looking at things inside yourself rather than outside. But I'm not sure if
people ever grow up properly. It's a continual process, growing in a positive
sense."

Of course, she's always been a serious thinker in her music. And again,
within The Sensual World, difficult subjects are tackled, such as
relationships under stress (Between A Man And A Woman), fears of childbirth
(This Woman's Work, written for John Hughes' film She's having A Baby), and
repressed emotions (Love And Anger). Plus there's Head's We're Dancing, a
dark chilling creation compared to its more positive bedfellows.

"The idea came from a family friend years ago who'd been to dinner and sat
next to this really fascinating guy, who was so charming that they sat all
night chatting and joking. Next day he found out it was Oppenheimer and this
friend was really horrified because he despised what the guy stood for.

"I was intrigued by this idea of being so taken with a person until you knew
who or what they were and then completely changing your attitude.
Then it turned into this story of a girl in 1939 being at a dance and this guy
coming up, cocky and charming, and she dances with him. Then, a couple of days
later, she sees in the paper it was Hitler. Complete horror; she was that
close, perhaps she could've changed history."

It's a song firmly in the Bush tradition, dating back to Wuthering Heights via
Army Dreamers, of immersing herself in a story, breathing life into it and
conveying the emotions of the participants. However chilling like the rest of
The Sensual World it's an honest, open, accessible song.

Rocket's Tail was inspired by Kate's cat: it's also a celebration of the
transient beauty of a firework's life; "It's also about how people see things
from different standpoints. Those with a negative outlook see only the
fizzle-fizzle while others see the celebration of the moment, the 'YEEAAAHHHHH!"

Walk Straight Down The Middle is "about following extremes when really you want
to plough this path straight down the middle. I'd like to think of myself as
holding the centre course whereas really I'm being thrown from one end of the
spectrum to the other and taking off all the time."

After four more years in the wilderness, punctuated only by the Peter Gabriel
collaboration Don't Give Up, several charitable outings and The Whole Story
singles compilation it's apparent that Kate Bush is stronger, more original,
more independent than before. The Sensual World may not have the commercial
obviousness of her early work, or the state-of-the-art high-tech command of
Hounds of Love, but it's truly a work of "positive female energy" and, above
all, a labour of love.

"Love is a wonderful and powerful thing," concludes Kate. "In many ways nearly
every song I've ever written is a love song. It's very important to try and
learn to love people as much as you can but we all get so scared. It's only
when people are at a point in their lives when they get such shocks that they
take it as it really should be. The rest of us just seem to piss about!"
