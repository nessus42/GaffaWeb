&gt; Ah!! &lt;slaps forehead&gt; Duh on me! I get it now, This has nothing
&gt; to do with Gaffaweb, but a "get back" at Stev0's slap at that
&gt; Frames site a while back, and Chris's rant against eliteism
&gt; in web sites. So, basically, you're willing to hurt Wieland's
&gt; feelings because Stev0 and Chris hurt that other guy's feeling.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok ;-)

It wasn't my intent to hurt anyone's feelings.  Go back and 
read that post, Vickie and drop the defensive looking for 
a fight attitude.  I was asking for lyrics.  I said, no
don't point me to GaffaWeb they aren't there.  No intent 
to say "look, they screwed up", just, "they aren't there".
As for the personalities, it said "IMO", meaning "To my 
taste and from my background".  No offense was intended 
and really, it was just an offhanded remark.  It also 
praised gaffaweb for being a nice piece of work.

Vickie, take a long look at the posts.  If someone 
does or says anything you or Chris disagree with, you 
are willing to "duke it out".  If someone says Kate 
might have made a mistake somewhere anywhere in her 
life, people here are willing to send them to Gehenna
for the NonBelievers.  Any hint of criticism that comes 
up, is met with a barrage of ThinkLikeMeOrDie pitchforks.

Doesn't the fun of doing this go away? Can you lighten up 
and not automatically assume it is an attack that must 
be met with a ful-force defense?  I defend those who 
are directly pummeled, mostly only when the language used
would be an excuse in my part of the world for really kicking 
someone's ass.  If Steve or Chris or even you said some 
of these things to people's faces, you wouldn't have 
a hair left and they would be fixing broken noses.  

You are becoming devils.  And the sad thing, for most
of us out here, IMO, this is supposed to be a place where 
we have fun.
