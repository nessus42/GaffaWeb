I have been reading the correspondence concerning people wanting Kate to tour.  
Of course a lot of people would love the chance, I myself for one, but it is not
for us to decide.  Kate will have her reasons for doing live work, or not, and 
it is not for us to challenge her on this aspect.  Her creativity is so 
obviously well suited to the studio and in this realm she is extremely 
comfortable, as I percieve it.  Live work is emotionally and physically 
demanding and not for everyone.  Tori, of course, tours almost incessently, only
breaking to record a new album.  But as anyone can see this is what Tori loves 
best, and if that is the way she wants to do it then that is fine, but don't 
please compare her to Kate - they are different people with different ways of 
doing things.  Yes, I love to see people doing their music live, as it is often 
quite different from studio recordings, but to expect Kate, or anyone, to do a 
tour or tours just because we want her to is unfair.  It's like saying, "OK we 
like the music but prove you really like us by touring."  That's crass.  It 
could be a lot worse, if Kate didn't make music at all we wouldn't even be here 
discussing this topic so please be a little more understanding and selfless and 
stop expecting Kate to tour.  For the record, I didn't see the tour either so 
I'm not looking at this argument from the been there/seen it perspective.  The 
music is what it is all about, and I have that on my CDs for whenever I want; if
I'm desperate for the visuals I watch the videos but usually I have my own 
visuals going in my head.  The imagination is an amazing thing, everyone who 
writes in these pages has one so use it!

Love and blessings (and I'm putting my umbrella up waiting for the flames...)

Krys
