I've been thinking about Len's comments, and I find it a "strange phenomenon"
(ahem) that he posted just what I've been musing about lately.

I like Kate and I like her music. I too would like her to tour. I don't think
wanting that is selfish, or mean, or uncaring of her. Obviously I would
not like her to go out just for the money (can you say The Who, boys and
girls?) or because there is a new record and a tour is what you "do" for a new
record (can you say half the bands on the road, boys and girls?). I would only
want her to do it if she wants to.
But damn it, I miss her. An album every four years and a single or two in between makes
it hard to sustain my interest. I'd like to see her do more, and [donning
asbestos suit] I really think her music could benefit from being played
live and getting some feedback from the world - as could she. I was
really sad reading the quote from the British radio show that was posted some
time ago - the host (Don Black) had arranged for Kate to go see Cats,
I think it was?, and it was the first musical she had been to in a very
long time. That scares me. It's difficult for an artist to create when
they are cut off from what the rest of the world is doing. And Kate has procued
some truly wonderful music when influenced by other artists (e.g. reggae
for Kite, or a Stevie Wonder concert for Sat In Your Lap).

I just want her to rejoin the world again. 

Cheers, Fiona
