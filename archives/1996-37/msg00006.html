&gt;Aside from the fact that KaTe uses blatently Anglecised pronounciations for 
the 
&gt;Angels' names (traditionally they are spoken using the Hebrew pronounciations: 
&gt;ga-vri-EL, ra-fay-EL, mee-chah-EL, oo-ree-EL) our dearest Lady has transposed 
&gt;the first two Angels, in relation to her self:

[Facinating stuff deleted.. for bandwidth]

&gt;We can endlessly speculate the reasons for this "switch" in KaTe's song, but I 
&gt;have hraed the following four explanations:
&gt;
&gt;1) KaTe heard or read this ritual once, and wanted to write a song about 
it, &gt;but she mis-remembered it.

Somehow I find this scenario not very likely. We all know how much
work she puts into her music.

&gt;2) KaTe is actually quite knowledgeable in this field, and knows the "real" 
&gt;version of the LBRP, but she modified it for the song to render it 
ineffectual, 
&gt;because she didn't want to be responsible for millions of "circles of 
&gt;protection" being generated world-wide, everytime "Lilly" plays on a radio or 
&gt;stereo.

This is even more facinating. Do you really mean that just the
sound should be sufficient to produce such an effect? (for those
who forcefully object to ANYTHING implying supernatural events,
think of this as a fantacy- roleplaying game. that way you don't
have to get upset...)
I always thought the power of this stuff came from the 
mind/spirit/soul and pronouncing words was just part of it.
If circles of protection are 'good', why should millions of them
worldwide be that bad?
I'm sure that Kate knows about the 'real' version, as told to
her by Lily.


&gt;3) KaTe is, in fact, divine, and in contact with Angelic powers, who have told 
&gt;Her to revise the LBRP, and have assigned a "New Order" to the Angels...

Most of us Love-Hounds (and IED in particular) agree that 
Kate Bush really is divine.
(In that case, She must be the one who decided that LBRP is to 
be revised...)


&gt;4) KaTe is actually a Hermetic Discordian, and has constructed this "twisted" 
&gt;version of the LBRP in order to help Immanetize the Eschaton, by throwing 
&gt;discord and confusion into the "currents" of Angelic Magick, Hermeticism, and 
&gt;Ceremonial Magick, because every time "Lilly" is played, it pisses off the 
&gt;Angels a little more, and they are going to eventually call for the 
"Opening of 
&gt;the Abyss"...

Now, I think THIS is waaay beyond facinating. You can't be serious
about this. No comments.


&gt;5) KaTe is familiar with the LBRP (although probably NOT a member of any 
&gt;Magickal Order, at least not an active member, although she may be a "social" 
&gt;member of the British G.'.D.'.) and uses it occasionally, and has written this 
&gt;song to illustrate the struggle she had integrating it into her paradigm. 

I really think you read more into this than there is.

I myself think that the names of the angels are mixed up because
Lily wanted it to be that way. Otherwise she wouldn't have agreed
to participate in neither TLTCTC nor the song.
As for the motives: who knows. Kate probably, but she has never 
been asked why, so we can only speculate. That is, until someone
is brave/bold enough to ask.


&gt;Of course, I may be reading a lot more into this song than was 
&gt;intended by KaTe, but that is what is so wonderful about the Internet. 
&gt;Here I can indulge my fantasies to a captive audience...


You know, I read a .sig a while ago about the Internet
being similar to a bunch of dancing elephants with diarrhoea.
(Nothing personal intended.)
Too bad I don't recall the whole .sig.
It seems to more true than ever...
