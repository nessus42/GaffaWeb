&gt; Subject: Re: rumours??

&gt; Kate was possibly (probably) irked with the successive failures of Harvest,
&gt; EMI America, and EMI Manhattan to provide her with even minimal support in
&gt; America, leading to her transfer to Columbia here, but those failures were
&gt; by regional labels and do not necessarily reflect on the home office.

As long as the artist refuses to do minimal things to support the 
album in America, the resources of  the record label will not be 
poured into a marginal artist.  They don't do business that 
way.  Kate Bush is a prestige client.  The costs of promoting 
such are phenomenal.  Just delivering the photos and the 
master tape to the label don't cut it in the 90s.  She knows 
this.  If she doesn't, she is out of touch or daft.

Everyone in the musical community acknowledges she is a genius 
and attractive lady.  A star, still, but a superstar any longer, 
no.  She gave it away to be a recluse.  You have to tour in 
America to make it.  She wants to have her cake and eat it too.
They only indulge such until the profit margins fail to match 
the investment.  So, as long as she makes some money, they 
won't drop her, but they won't promote her either.  Were it 
not for her fans and friends, Kate would be washed up in the business.

Right now most of the legends of country and western music do not
have record deals.  That is also true of many 70s rock stars. 

If she has decided to retire, that would be a tragedy.  In many 
ways musically, she was just starting to come into her own.
Even if she does, she will find it harder to quit than she thinks.
