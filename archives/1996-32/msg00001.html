&gt; &gt;Interesting, two "Kashka from Baghdad", and no alternate "Babooshka"s?
&gt; 
&gt; Bryan, I have a copy that another kind soul made for me, and while I do
&gt; have all the tracks you listed, I also have 2 different versions of "Babooshka".

Sorry to dissappoint you, I was referring to someone elses posting, and
my comment was their tape did not have the two demo versions of Babooshka.
Which I generally refer to as "Early Piano" and "Beatbox" versions.
Their tape also had two "Kashka"s, which interested me, or perhaps they
were the same one, just twice.

&gt; Most noticeable in the first one is the inclusion of the lines:
&gt; 
&gt; She sent him scented letters
&gt; She was a delightful detective
&gt; 
&gt; and 
&gt; 
&gt; And when he laid eyes on her,
&gt; He got the feeling that he knew her well.
&gt; Uncanny how she
&gt; Reminds him of his fiancee.
&gt; She seems to know the way to please him.

Yep! That's the "Early Piano" version.
The "Beatbox" version has different lines from the N4E version:
	And when he laid eyes on her,
	He got the feeling that he knew her well.
	Uncanny how she
	Can take him back into a piece of past.
	Can say the things that make him want to laugh.
	Just like his wife before she freezed on him,
I assume you have this version too?

&gt; Were these versions not available on yours, or have I stumbled 
&gt; across an actual rarity? I never have this kind of luck, so....

It is a rarity, but so many people have the various bootlegs, I would
not classify them as such, although I've never seen them in a shop, I
got my home demos CD (from Pig records) from a kind Love-Hound, paid
him for it, of course.
