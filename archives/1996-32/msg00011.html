&gt;Hi to everyone out there in Gaffa-land!
&gt;
&gt;I had a very nice dream last night.  I thought I'd share it with you all,
&gt;since it was so pleasant for me!
&gt;
&gt;My sister and I suddenly found ourselves walking in a strange neighborhood in
&gt;England (we're from the U.S.)  "How did we get here?" we asked. (How did we
&gt;know it was England, I wonder now that I'm awake.)  "Oh well, it doesn't
&gt;matter," we agreed, "we may as well explore since we're here!"  The
&gt;neighborhood consisted of old brick mansions, most covered with layers of ivy
&gt;creeping up the walls and around the chimneys.  My sister and I stood in
&gt;front of one particularly quaint old home.  We agreed it was the most humble
&gt;of all the homes in the neighborhood, yet peculiarly, the most elegant and
&gt;beautiful.  As we stared at the picturesque house, the sun went behind a
&gt;cloud, shadows shifted and suddenly I could see through one of the upstairs
&gt;windows into a room.  A woman sat at her computer, staring at the screen very
&gt;intently, pausing only a moment or two to check the keyboard as she typed.
&gt; As I looked at this woman, I suddenly realized who it was.  Some almighty
&gt;one had set me down in England smack dab in front of Kate Bush's home!  I
&gt;elbowed my sister, pointed toward the ivy-bordered window and said, "Look!
&gt;Kate!"  Just as I was pointing, the object of my fascination looked out of
&gt;the window and caught me pointing and staring at her.  Feeling a little
&gt;foolish for looking like a silly tourist or crazed fan, I fumbled an meager
&gt;wave in her direction which I hoped would indicate to her that I wasn't crazy
&gt;or silly.  I hoped she would see that I felt a little foolish. Kate didn't
&gt;move, she just kept looking at us.  After an unbearable eternity (probably
&gt;only five seconds) she raised her hand in a polite return wave to us.  I
&gt;smiled and my sister and I began to walk back the way we had come.  As we
&gt;walked along the street, past the shrubbery dividing Kate's yard from her
&gt;next-door neighbor's yard, I heard a creaking sound coming from her house
&gt;behind us.  Turning my head, I saw Kate opening a window up on the second
&gt;floor.  She stuck her head out, waving frantically at us.  She didn't say a
&gt;word.  Then she disappeared back inside her house.  My sister and I stood
&gt;there waiting, not knowing what to do or what to expect.  As we waited, a
&gt;side door to her house opened, and out stepped Kate.  She had cut her hair to
&gt;just below shoulder-length and wore it clipped back behind each ear with
&gt;little plastic barrettes.  Her outfit was quite frumpy--like my mother used
&gt;to wear back in 1982--a pale blue short sleeved plain shirt with a pocket
&gt;over one breast tucked into a light blue skirt which was just a tad darker
&gt;than her shirt.  Despite her plain garb, she looked ever the goddess.  She
&gt;wore no shoes.  How humble were her small feet!  She took a few steps out of
&gt;the door into her yard.  Without looking, she kicked aside a couple of stray
&gt;leaves as she walked.  Then she stopped.  She looked at us.  The leaves in
&gt;the treetops above us rustled softly as the wind spread itself through them.
&gt; We looked at Kate.  She held her hands together in front of her, like a
&gt;curious, yet cautious little girl.  She looked as if she were going to
&gt;suddenly begin running toward us, as if she hadn't seen a single person in
&gt;months.  But I was wrong.  She slowly turned around, walked inside the house
&gt;and silently shut the door.  The moment we heard the lock in the door click,
&gt;the wind stopped, the leaves quit rustling and everything was silent.
&gt; Nothing moved.  All was still. We knew we had just had an encounter with a
&gt;god.  We turned back and continued on our way.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, there was more after that but it was all crazy weird dreamtime stuff.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for letting me rant and rave about this wonderful dream!  There was
&gt;something so mysterious, enigmatic and eternal about this dream.  Thanks for
&gt;letting me remember it again in all the glorious detail!
&gt;
&gt;Merry Katemas!
&gt;~~~Samantha
&gt;
That was truly beautiful! Thank you Samantha for sharing your
Dreamtime with us. Made my day. :~)
Sincerely,
                Stew
