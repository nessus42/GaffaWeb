&gt;&gt; How did you like Hounds of Love?  If you're in the mood for
&gt;&gt; another great singer, try Ani Difranco.  She's terrific! 
&gt;
&gt; You know..........I was just yesterday thinking " I gotta 
&gt; get back to the Kate Newsgroup and thank those kind folks
&gt; for their time and let them know how I like their suggestion!
&gt; I swear it's true!  So I would like you to post this reply
&gt; for me.
&gt;
&gt; I bought *hounds* back about a month ago and gave it a few
&gt; good listens. I must be honest, my first impressions were
&gt; not positive. I first tried to "feel" influences both to 
&gt; and from Kate and it was painfully obvious that Kate is
&gt; very strongly influenced by Joan Armatrading. I thought
&gt; that much of the music could have been written by Joan. I
&gt; could also see the threads being drawn to Tori Amos' vocal
&gt; and expression styling. Very similar yet separate in their
&gt; innovation. All in all a very interesting experience. I love
&gt; *The big sky* and *jig of life*. I think they are really
&gt; fresh and inventive and sound new even though they are now
&gt; over a decade old! It took me a while to "grow" into this
&gt; CD but it is that way for me with many of my favorite artists.
&gt; If it were too accessable right away I probably would have
&gt; lost interest in it quickly, but this is one CD in my heavy
&gt; rotation now! I'm gonna make another Kate purchase before too
&gt; long and I'll give my impressions again after a little
&gt; "studying"!!!

Joan Armatrading, huh?  That's the first time I remember anyone
making the association to Kate!  I've seen Joan perform on 
Saturday Night Live, but don't have any of her albums.  I know 
she's been around for twenty years, and I guess she deserves a 
closer look.

For your next Kate purchase, I repeat my recommendation of The 
Sensual World, as my favorite next to Hounds of Love.

Happy Listening,
Michael
