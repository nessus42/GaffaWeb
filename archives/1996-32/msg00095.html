Well, I'm certainly glad I could get all you guys stirred up like this!

&gt; Hmmm, I say "loading a new program" too, is that wrong?

Okay, not a GREAT example, but it does sound affected to me.

&gt; On "press Execute". How do you know it's not a mouse driven 
&gt; application? ie point and click, where you WOULD point at a "button" 
&gt; that could very easily have "Execute" on it?

Oh, Bryan.  There's really nothing Kate could do that you couldn't 
rationalize somehow, is there?

&gt; Ahhh, THANKS for the idea. I have just changed my kate page lyric
&gt; search engine request button to say "Execute". I love it!
&gt; Feel free to "press Execute" all you want.

Bryan, I'm shocked!  I felt certain you'd tell me that you'd contracted 
to have an "execute" key injection-molded for my keyboard.  Would you 
like the dimensions of the Enter key it will replace?  Now, THAT would 
be winning the argument ....

&gt;&gt; And naturally we HAVE to have the little synth-y beeps and boops,
&gt;&gt; *everybody* knows computers make those kinds of noises, silly.
&gt;
&gt;Of course! You may say "silly" but personally I'm quite disappointed at
&gt;modern computers, they just don't have lots of lights either, they're
&gt;just plain boxes - boring!

You never got around to explaining the "beeps and boops," but no bother; 
I'm certain you could have come up with something.

&gt; You have to understand that videos are just theatrics, which 
&gt; exaggerate to make things so obvious.  License granted!

No, I understand no such thing.  What you'd call "theatrics" I would 
call "phony."  "License" certainly NOT granted by me!

&gt; Incidentally, how many of you (yes, I mean you) spend evenings
&gt; with your computer? I'm not taking a survey, but just listen to
&gt; the track, read the lyrics, and consider the concept of the song.
&gt; Time to act on my "bodily needs" - no... eat.

Finally, we can agree on something.  As I said, I have no quarrel with 
the "I'm using this as an obsession to avoid something else" theme of 
the song.  I just think her execution fell short -- or should I say, she 
didn't "press execute" very well?  (Sorry, couldn't resist)
