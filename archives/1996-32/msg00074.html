&gt; I have a tough time taking 'Deeper understanding' and 'Heads We're

Okay, it's most likely personal taste, but I don't consider them silly. 
"Deeper Understanding" always gives me the impression that Kate was 
trying to show how too much of anything can be bad, and that she was just 
expressing this. And "Head's We're Dancing" - I always thought the idea 
was that she didn't initially realise that this guy she dances with is 
Hitler, as if she is naive in some way, that she doesn't have much 
experience in the world... kind of like in this story she is actually 
stepping out into the world and while she liked the guy at first, enjoyed 
the dancing, she doesn't like it when she realises that he is Hitler 
because of all she has heard (i.e. she might not have seen his picture 
until that morning when she reads the paper - i.e. she is incredibly 
naive up to that point).

&gt;  Much of the rest of the album is *GREATNESS* 
&gt; (by her KaTeNess), however.  I love TSW, the Fog, Rocket's Tail...Yep, I 
&gt; like the Trio, but I just don't like some of ....(ackkk..) Kate's songs.

"Rocket's Tail"... I love that song, and I was thinking about whether it 
was inspired by the original version of "Rocket Man"... just in the 
sleeve of "Two Rooms" she says something along the lines that being asked 
which track she wanted to do for the tribute was like being asked if she 
wanted to fulfil her dream, to be Rocket Man... Just a thought... anyone 
got any more details than that on why she chose to cover RM?

Alan.
