The glossy flyers for _The Red Shoes_ that have been mentioned are
part of the marketing materials for TRS that were completed before
the release date was pushed back.  Also included in those materials
was a two page flyer describing Columbia's plans for marketing TRS.

Here are some of the more interesting bits...

| Overview
| ...
| The building of her own studio and her no-tour policy only helped 
| further enshroud Kate in mystery and privacy.  But information on
| her recordings sped through an amazingly sophisticated network of
| fan clubs, fanzines and computer on-line networks.  The legion of
| Kate's incredibly loyal and dedicated fans - the "Love Hounds" -
| will purchase any and all material on her, from books to photographs
| to overseas releases.  
| 
| They also celebrate Katemas parties - yearly celebrations that take
| place on Kate's birthday - to talk about their favorite artist - Kate!
| ...
| Kate is also making another first - a 60-minute film based on _The
| Red Shoes_.  This film will contain six videos for the following songs:
| "Eat the Music," "The Red Shoes," "And So Is Love," "Lily," "Moments
| of Pleasure," and "Rubberband Girl."  Again a first - six fully-completed
| videos for album tracks done prior to the album's release!
| ...
| 
| Retail
| 
| The Alternative accounts will receive four-color advance flyers complete
| with in-store date and package art one month prior to the album's
| release.  We will also plan listening parties for alternative accounts
| in all major markets. ...
| 
| Midnight Madness Sale/ Film Screenings
| 
| The idea here is simple - create monster anticipation for day one
| of this release by staging screenings of Kate's film in select markets.
|  These screenings will be tied-in with local alternative radio stations,
| retail and video outlets.   The timing is as follows: Alternative
| radio for "Eat The Music" on September 7th.  _The Red Shoes_ will
| be in stores on October 5th.  Alternative radio will be given the
| promotion in their market and will announce the film screening at
| a local theater and a midnight madness sale at a local record store.
| 
| Promotional Visit
| 
| We are hoping to have Kate in New York for two weeks sometime in September.
| 
| Special Packaging
| 
| A special, limited-edition digipak of _The Red Shoes_ will be available
| simultaniously with the regular release.  This special digipak will
| include extra photos, a sticker and four-color disc, as well as added
| bonus tracks - the extended mixes of both "Eat the Music" and "Rubberband
| Girl."
| ...
| 
| Press
| 
| The first official word on _The Red Shoes_ will be sent out via press
| release at the end of July.  Advance music will be sent out to select,
| targeted music publications, critical press, and MTV News.  Of course,
| word on this release has already spread and commitments are already
| in from the likes of Rolling Stone, People, Mondo 2000, Details, Harper's
| Bazaar, and Elle.
| 
| College Press: A press conference with 10-15 major college papers
| will take place during Kate's promotional visit to New York in September.
| 
| Video
| 
| The first clip serviced will be "Eat the Music."  Detailed video promotions
| are still under discussion.
| 
| P.O.P.
| 
| Advance four-color CD header card with in-store date.
| 2 x 3 artist blow-up.
| Double sided flat.
| 
| Sales History
| 
| Kate's last release, _The Sensual World_, has sold over 1.5 million
| copies worldwide, with domestic sales nearing Gold status.
| 
| Selling Points
| 
| o  Kate is a world-renowned artist - known for her brilliant work
|    and her legions of loyal fans.
| 
| o  _The Red Shoes_ is hre most personal work to date, and features
|    surprise guest artists.
| 
| o  Since Kate releases a record every three years or so, the anticipation
|    for _The Red Shoes_ has already saturated the alternative world
|    and beyond.  The so-called "Kate Network"  has been talking about
|    this release all summer.
| 
| o  The film of this release, plus its six videos, will be a major
|    tool in marketing this record.
| 
| o  The special digipak will bring added attention at the retail level.
|    The quantities won't last!
| 
| o  Expect immediate action on all alternative fronts.
