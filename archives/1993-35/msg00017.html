&gt;KaTe's new film is going to be screened one day only next month in
&gt;Harvard Square, Cambridge:
&gt;Monday, October 4, 1993
&gt;_The_Line,_the_Cross,_the_Curve_

Since the album has been pushed back (Nov? Jan? Who knows? Who cares?)
is this screening still on?

(I say "who cares?" just because every red-blooded American Kate fan
will buy an import copy ASAP after October 5. If Sony is going to be
that stupid, to hell with them. I'll only buy an American copy if the
cover is different or if there are non-UK tracks on it. No chance of 
that, which just means that Sony lost a sale...damn, then again, I
want Kate to do well in America...nope, never mind, I won't buy from
Sony. Stupid cretins.)

Chris bought the "Rubberband Girl" CD single and 7" single today. I
*love* that photo!

I'm very saddened to hear confirmation that Kate and Del have broken
up. It would seem that some of the songs on TSW ("Between A Man and A
Woman") are more autobiographical than we might have realized at the
time. Maybe, anyway.

That Sunday Times thing...wretched! What a shame that the first major
interview/article is so negative. It says so much more about the
writer's sloppy and combative mindset than it does about Kate and her
music. Did that writer ever write for NME?

(Thanks Neal, for typing it in)

Leave it to IED to give us the "real" story behind the interview! Thanks!!

A friend of ours who isn't on the net is a big Kate fan. Tim is also an
audiophile and goes into a tweaking frenzy whenever he comes over to
our place. He's not obnoxiously meticulous, but he is meticulous about
sound. He usually only listens to classical music, though he does like
some pop, Kate, Nina Hagen, Camper Van Beethoven (&lt;--a guilty pleasure)
Peter Gabriel and Jane Siberry are his favorites. Anyway, we were talking
about the brouhaha regarding the sound of The Sensual World and he was
suprised to hear about it. After thinking a bit about why he was suprised,
he told me that he's used to listening to the English LP on very high-end
equipment, and that it sounds beautiful. On his system, the sound is clear
and clean, and the details are very easy to hear. The album is lush and
"thick" (though not "heavy" like The Dreaming) and in his opinion, the
engineering is perfectly suited to the album. He can understand how, on
CD, especially the American CD, played on um..."regular" equipment, the
sound would be "muddy" and hissy. His theory is that Sony didn't press
their CDs from the master tapes, but rather a dub of the master tapes.
That would definitely explain the hissiness and would contribute to the
muddiness. Without meaning to disparage the equipment anyone is using,
we put forth the theory that the engineering problems that a lot of
people are complaining about are not actually a fault of Del's engineering
competency, but rather Sony's cut-rate, "who'll really care?" attitude
and treatment. All I know is that 1) the album sounds great on our
equipment, which is mid high-end, 2) Tim is nit-picky, knows what he's
talking about, and would be the first to complain if TSW were "muddy" and
3) it seems to be mainly Americans who are complaining about the sound,
production and engineering of TSW. Americans who presumably are playing
the Sony CD.

I'd like to hear from another audiophile who has high-end equipment and
the English EMI LP. Are there any out there? What do you think?

Have I said recently how much I loved Sheila Chandra at WOMAD? (Did I
say I got to interview her? She's *so* nice!)
