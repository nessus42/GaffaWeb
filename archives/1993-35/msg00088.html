<PRE>
Steve states that the "Alternative Hounds" mix of "Hounds of Love" is 
"unnecessary".  Without beginning another interminable and dull
argument over quality, etc. (particularly one with IED -- none of us
wants that), IED respectfully suggests that "Alternative Hounds" and
"Hounds of Love" (the LP cut) can (with some care for keeping the two
songs' respective beats synchronized and attention to the discrepancy
of two bars before the final chorus) be combined into one entirely new
and spectacular Kate Bush record. They also sound great when played
simultaneously, out of synch, at high volume, on two separate sound 
systems --  a colossal edifice of Katian noise...  

Jim recommends a CD purporting to include excerpts from the
"Amsterdam" concert.  He says the sound is amazingly great, though not
in stereo.  He (and all readers tempted to go out and buy this
product) should be made aware that the reason the sound is good is
because the CD actually contains a poor dub of the official live video
called Live On Stage at the Hammersmith Odeon (May 13, 1979).  The
fact that the stereo is not particularly apparent is an indication
that this is an inferior dub even of the Hammersmith concert film.  
Kaveat empTor.

-- Andrew Marvick (IED)
   P.S.: Thanks, Richard Caldwell, for posting the press-kit text (or
excerpts).  Very interesting.  For what it's worth, IED has been told
by employees at no fewer than three stores in Manhattan that the album
is being delayed until January not only by Sony but by EMI (UK) as
well.  One person claimed to have a friend who works in Sony's
Alternative department (do they have such a department?) who reported
that the reason for the delay was a last-minute decision to coordinate
the album's release with the forthcoming movie, and to include Kate's
track "The Red Shoes" in the movie itself.  Of course, this is all
probably mere speculation, but if true, it might mean not only a delay
in the album's release but some re-packaging of the product, as well
as significantly altered (and increased?) though delayed publicity in
the U.S.
