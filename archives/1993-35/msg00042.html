<PRE>
Finally I found the CD5 here in Germany! First something again I've already
mentioned on one of my university accounts today, Candle In The Wind is missing
on it. Not that I really miss it... I spoke to one of the two who already did
find it before me again, and he said that CITW wasn't on his disk too, some
misunderstanding on my side. Maybe the other one, we'll see.

My impressions:

Rubberband Girl: I've already said it before, I love this song. And it's still
growing...

Rubberband Girl extended mix: This is sort of a gimme more mix, unfortunately
not very many new ideas for the mix. It's not a remix, it's really just extended.
Not an alternate version, not a xy-special-something-mix. Nevertheless I love
it, but that's obvious. Not being very different from something good means
that it is about as good...

Big Stripey Lie: Well, this is quite weird! It's also growing with every listen,
but it has problems in keeping up with Rubberband Girl... And on an endless
repeat it's underrepresented by a factor of two. Probably I have to listen
to BSL on headphones at full volume :-)

Candle In The Wind: I'm lucky it isn't there. I'll get the UK version soon,
but I don't think I'll play it very often.

Two other things:

A friend of mine has a CD-ROM drive that ignores the "don't copy me digitally
over SCSI" bit in the TOC. He has already sent me 8 1/2 seconds of Lionheart
(before I got a modem my machine was called Lionheart, I had to change to
something shorter than or equal to 8 characters, and I have the 'Oh England,
My Lionheart' beginning as a soundfile that's played when you log in.) He just
provided me with a better version ;-).

Now he has promised to send me small pieces of both Candle In The Wind versions
(normal &amp; instrumental). Let's see if I can calculate the synth out of it. The
only remaining problem then would be to handle 100 Megabytes of data. (One
channel of the song is about 25 MB. In the end I need at least the two vocal-
only channels (50 MB), and if I don't want to split the files I would also
need to have one channel of normal plus one channel of instrumental to do it.)
I guess I'll use tar &amp; gzip for a while...

Now what was the second thing? I have forgotten :-(. Maybe later!

Ciao,

Uli
