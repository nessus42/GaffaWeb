Well...I have just finished listening to ETM, and I Love It. It makes 
me *smile*, and feel good. (Regardless, I couldn't help but chuckle 
when I remembered the Smells like Teen Spirit comment) I even liked 
the 12" version. So PLBT on you who didn't like it. :-b.....

On first listening to BST, my reaction was 'Huh'? It really is 
pretty far out there, about the same as when I heard TD for 
the first time. Second listen is 'OH!', although the 'War of 
the Worlds' sample sounds a little shrill...Third play, I fooled 
with the equalization to try to make out the background lyrics 
(no soap on most of them...) Fourth play, I find I like the quieter
parts more and more, and I think the ending is very nice. 
Also, at one point, the modem in my office dialed just after the 
first lyric, and it sounded *right*! :) I find I'm getting more 
and more of the background lyrics as I listen to it...give me 
about 100 more tries, and I should have it all figured out. :)

I like what she did with Candle in the Wind. However, since I know 
the song so well, I kept singing with her in my mind, and kept mentally 
tripping...and I think between the "just a kid" and "The candle..." 
there seems to be a glitch in editing, it feels wrong when listening 
to it through, and going back and playing it a few times serves
to heighten the feeling of awkwardness. Maybe it's just me...

Oh! I also spotted the KT sign, and am very impressed.

Also, a question: Does ETM have to do with her and Del's failing/failed
relationship? I note the second and third verses. In general,how close 
are the songs Kate writes and her life ups and downs? 

Oh, and the etc... EMACS is to vi as KATE is to...well...bascially anybody...
