	I just discovered a delightful "import live" recording of a concert
in Amsterdam from April 29, 1979. It is a single CD entitled _Wow_, released
by Great Dane Records in Italy.  The sound quality is excellent for a 
bootleg--  in fact, it is the best sound quality I've ever heard on a boot-
leg.  I don't think it's in stereo, though.

	Here's the track list as printed on the cover:

1.	Moving
2.	Them Heavy People
3.	Violin
4.	Strange [actually Strange Phenomena]
5.	Hammer Horror
6.	Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbreak [sic]
7.	Wow
8.	Feel It
9.	Kite
10.	James And the COld Gun
11.	Oh England My Linearity [heh!]
12.	Wuthering Heights

	Other than the mispellings and the graininess of the picture on
the back of the CD, the cover is fairly professional looking and even has
one of those product stripes.  On the front of the CD is a picture of Kate,
arms extended to the sides, wearing what appears to be a sequined top and (so 
it seems) some sort of red cape, although this could just be a trick caused
by some curtain or banner. The back of the CD has a picture of Kate
(in concert) with a mock "surprised-scared" look on her face.  There are
also two pictures inside the liner notes.  One is of Kate wearing blue jeans
and a button-down top sitting backwards on a chair and singing into a
hand-held microphone.  (On all of the other pictures she has one of those
attached-to-the-collar mikes).  The other inner picture depicts her being
raised in the air by two muscular men with scanty tops (dancers?) and 
singing with her arms outstretched.

	I was kind of surprised at how little she varied the songs live
from the way they are on the albums.  The two main exceptions are "Kite"
and "James and the Cold Gun", both of which she extends quite a bit. ("Kite"
ends up being a little over 6 minutes and "James and the Cold Gun" just under
nine minutes.  She also does some unexpected, transformations in phrasing,
volume, and vocal style on parts of "James and the Cold Gun."  There's also
a lengthy instrumental part at the end.

	In short, I thought this was an excellent purchase, and in spite of 
its being grossly overpriced, even for a bootleg, I'd highly reccomend it to 
other Kate fans.  My only regret is that it doesn't say who was playing 
what in the band at the concert.  Are there any Kate-trivia folks out there
who might happen to the answer to that question?

	Forgive me if this is a well-known bootleg and this is all old news
here on rec.music.gaffa, but I thought that at least a few people out there
might be interested.  Is there a FAQ for this group where we keep a list
and reviews of all known Kate Bush bootlegs.  If not, maybe we should start
one.  

	--  Jim C. &lt;jchokey@leland.stanford.edu&gt;
