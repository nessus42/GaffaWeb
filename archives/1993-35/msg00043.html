&gt;Have I said recently how much I loved Sheila Chandra at WOMAD? (Did I
&gt;say I got to interview her? She's *so* nice!) 

lucky you.  i was a bit pissed off that she put a little note directed
at samplers in her new CD, it basically says "don't sample my voice -
i will prosecute.  i don't consider it flattery, i consider it
stealing."  there goes another song down the toilet.  *sigh*

&gt;Anyway, we were talking about the brouhaha regarding the sound of The
&gt;Sensual World and he was suprised to hear about it.
[snip - basically he thinks it's way keen]

&gt;details are very easy to hear. The album is lush and "thick" (though
&gt;not "heavy" like The Dreaming)

this is ridiculous.  the dreaming is NOT a heavy album!  do you even
have an *inkling* of what i'm talking about when i complain about the
engineering on TSW?  listen to the vocal and drum tracks - TD's have a
level of "transparency" that is absolutely perfect - classically great
engineering style.  now listen to TSW - tearing, digital crud all over
the place... i could've done better with a 4-track cassette and a
radio shack microphone.  this is NOT an acceptable professional studio
production!  i would've SHOT the engineer and gone to real studio
after hearing that crap.

&gt;it seems to be mainly Americans who are complaining about the sound,
&gt;production and engineering of TSW. Americans who presumably are
&gt;playing the Sony CD.

presumptiveness is really your forte, isn't it?  i have the british
EMI CD and a very nice system, thank you.  i'll gladly play you any
ten current dance records and stack them up against mine to prove that
i know what i'm talking about when it comes to engineering.

&gt;Quick! Quick! I'm taking bets on how long it will take Drukman to respond
&gt;to this! Do I have any wagers? ;-)

it's stamped 2 AM thursday (EDT), and i'm responding at 11 AM thursday
(PDT), so that's, um.. 9 hours.  whoever bet on 9 hours wins an
autographed photo of my pet gila monster, spanky.  unfortunately,
you'll need to fly to california to pick it up.

&gt;I like "Eat the Music,"  but my mind can't help but wander to
&gt;this every time I hear it:
&gt;Grab a banana
&gt;And a sultana
&gt;A mosquito
&gt;My libido

score another one for the mighty wit of Stev0 Berlin!!
