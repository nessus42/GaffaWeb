&gt;1. Jig of Life   
   
&gt;These are included in the group but I couldn't rate them: The Infant
&gt;Kiss, Egypt, Under Ice, Hello Earth, Rocket's Tail, This Woman's Work.     
                                                                      
&gt;Anybody else consider any of these favorites of their own?                  
   
Yes!  I cannot even express in words how much I love "Under Ice."  It is
one of my favorite songs ever by anybody.  Every time I listen to it is
a religious experience.  It's simply wonderful.  "Jig of Life," "The
Infant Kiss," and "This Woman's Work" are also favorites of mine.  In
fact, it was "This Woman's Work" that really got me listening to Kate.  I
had heard "RUTH" back when it was popular in the US and was unimpressed (I
now love "RUTH," though).  Then, I heard "TWW" on the _She's Having a Baby_
soundtrack.  I thought, "Anyone who could create such a beautiful, perfect
song must be worth another a try."  I was right.   
   
On a negative note, I must admit while _The Dreaming_ (the album) is one of
my Kate favorites, I have never been able to appreciate "The Dreaming"
(the song).  One of my roommates who is a not a very big Kate fan thinks
it's the best thing she's ever done, but I just don't get it.  Then again,
he doesn't understand how I can like "Houdini" with all that screaming. :-)
