Hi all!

    It's been a while since I posted so there are lots of things to talk about!


Fiona sez...
&gt;I would also hope, without getting into the great debate of "what is
&gt;an opinion, what is a valid opinion, what is a fact", that people could
&gt;express misgivings about her work without it being suggested that
&gt;love-hounds turn into alt.bash.kate. There is a difference between
&gt;saying "Kate is useless and a talentless poseur" and saying "I really
&gt;like and appreciate what she has done before but this new music doesn't
&gt;do it for me".

    Yeah, I to am getting a little sick of what seemed to be becoming out right
KaTe bashing. I still haven't got my copy of ETM yet so I can comment greatly
on the debate except to say that what I've had of it (11Khz Mac 'snd ') hasn't
made me want to -hate- it yet. It's different. It gets in. (After the first
time that I heard it, it wouldn't get out of my head!!) :-)

    I can say this for RBG, it's VERY contagious as a song. I've played it here
at work and got it played to about 800 people at Uni Movies during the break
and many people whom normally wouldn't consider themselves as KaTe music buffs
have asked me who it was. They LIKED it! :-) At the same time BSL is there for
the long tie fans to latch onto. Sort of like a guiding path that  helps lead
the fan on the way to the new music.

Uli sez...
&gt;this is a great time! MTV Europe has played at least 9 (repeat: nine!)
&gt;times something from Kate in less than 96 hours! Saturday: twice those 48
seconds
&gt;of Rubberband Girl in MTV First Look. Sunday: Another 48 seconds of Rubberband
&gt;Girl. Monday: Running Up That Hill on MTV Greatest Hits (twice). Tuesday:
&gt;Babooshka on MTV Greatest Hits (twice), Wednesday (very early morning)
Rubberband
&gt;Girl again. Has this ever happened before? I can't remember such a half-week!

    WOW. Now if only one of the Oz music video programmes would get onto it. I
was talking to EMI Sydney and there response to questions about the video was 
."...what???..." :-\

IED sez...
&gt;Here is a restored edition of the Sunday London Times Colour Supplement
&gt;[Brilliant re-do of crappy interview deleted]

    HA!!! It's great to have IED back too. Things are starting to feel like the
halcyon days of gaffa circa 1989-90. Keep the flame burning!!! &lt;he he&gt;

Karen sez...
&gt;there will be a special edition of TRS album, wrapped in fabric.

    Hu?!

Vickie sez...
&gt;Have I said recently how much I loved Sheila Chandra at WOMAD? (Did I
&gt;say I got to interview her? She's *so* nice!) 

    How lucky can you get!? :-) When I saw her in Sydney it was a wonderfully
intermit concert. Sort of like being at a Tori concert. I waited till most of
the people had left at the end of the show and went to see if I could meet her.
She was VERY kind and came and said hello, we had a bit of a chat and then she
signed ALL of my CD's 8-) I was only going to get her to sign one BUT I
couldn't resist asking if she'd do the others. She was amazed that somebody had
them all. :-)

Scott sez...
&gt;Promos:
&gt;
&gt;8/9	UK	Rubberband Girl "teaser" CD5		EMI GIRL1
&gt;		(spoken message, 400 copies, red promo cover)

    Can anybody spread any light on these? What is the message??


&gt;I've put two of Richard Jenning's Sunday Times photo scans up for anon
&gt;FTP on ftp.epcc.ed.ac.uk in pub/local/images/gif/kate/sun_times:
&gt;I've also scanned the photo in last month's Q magazine (16-shade
&gt;greyscale, 329x599). It's available as:

    Thanks Scott!! Nice work!!

    More info... EMI Australia say that TRS is still slated for release here in
October. Interestingly, they said that the delay was because of some trouble
with some of the tracks on the album. They said that they had to be re-done!!
Does anybody if this right?

   Also, Richard Frost put me onto this one, if any of you other Oz fans get a
chance, check out Tommy Emmanuelle's latest CD single release 'The Journey'
from his new album. The beginning dig. rift has been lifted straight from
KaTe's 'The Dreaming'!! There is nothing on the cover giving credit to either
KaTe or Rolf Harris BUT just listen to it and see what you think!! BTW it's
another nice piece from Tommy too!! :-)

    See  ya!
