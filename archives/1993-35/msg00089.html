&gt;  I just picked up Sarah McLachlan's "Possession" and I have to agree with
&gt;previous posters who think it is excellent.  Everyone should run right 
&gt;out and get this!!!  And if it isn't available in the US or elsewhere yet

You lucky person! I caught the song on CFNY but I doubt we will be getting the
single or the album in Buffalo for a looong time.

&gt;then I say "nyah nyah nyah nyah!" because so far I haven't been able to
&gt;locate a copy of "Eat The Music" anywhere.  If anyone knows of any record
&gt;stores in Buffalo that might have a copy of ETM, please email the details.

Buffalo? you got it! Record Theatre has both the Eat the Music CD single
and the import of Rubberband Girl. I don't know what details you need,
ie. do you know Record Theatre? if you have any questions, e-mail me and I'll
do my best to answer. :-)

&gt;And FYI, Nettwerk (Sarah's label) is on the net at nettwerk@mindlink.bc.ca.
&gt;This is listed on the back of the single, along with their other address
&gt;info.
&gt;  As for "Rubberband Girl", it's great and "Big Stripey Lie" is even better
&gt;and I can't wait to hear the whole album.  Speaking of which, what's the
&gt;deal?  Is it still coming out Oct. 4 in the UK or has that also been pushed
&gt;back?  I have friends going over there and already told them not to bother
&gt;getting it for me because they aren't going to be back until the 11th, but 
&gt;that was before this latest delay.
&gt;  In other news, I saw the box set for $230 CAN when I was in North Bay on
&gt;the long weekend (a meer $100 more than it is in Hamilton).  If any north
&gt;Ontario love-hounds want one, I can fix you up for $230 with tax and 
&gt;shipping included.  :)  Next time someone complains because northerners 
&gt;only pay $10 to renew a car license, point out how much more the necessities
&gt;of life cost up there.  :)

This might interest you as well. Record Theatre (the branch that is near me
at any rate) has a copy of This Womans Work for $120 US dollars.
