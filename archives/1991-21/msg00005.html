larry spence sez:
&gt;Joanna Townshend?  Julianna Townshend?  I forget, too... but I wanted to
&gt;make a plug for skinnerbox.  I got their (her) CD with the most recent
&gt;album _The Playhouse_ and the previous one, _The Imaginary Heart Of_ on
&gt;a single disc.

i think that _the imaginary heart of_ is newer material as _the playhouse_
has been available on vinyl for about a year now (almost a year anyways).
the double cd has just sudddenly popped up...

skinnerbox also has a eponymous debut that is a lot darker and maniacal.
_the imaginary heart of_ is, in some ways, synth fluff next to the first
release.

by the way, there is a ska band in the new york area who call themselves
skinnerbox as well. i found out the hard way: going to a skinnerbox show
at wetlands only to find a seven-member ska band on stage. no matter - i
still had a good time.

&gt;I haven't seen much mention of _Ophelia's Shadow_ on the net, but I might
&gt;have missed it.  This is not the same as the Sunday All Over The World
&gt;disc that I think Toyah almost ruins.

oops - i goofed. i had thought that previous comments were aimed at
_ophelia's shadow_, not the other one, which i have not heard yet.

is _saotw_ released under her name? or is that the artist name?

&gt;I haven't heard OS (after the
&gt;SAOTW disc, I wasn't too keen on more Toyah), but I've heard it described
&gt;as SAOTW with a different guitarist (no Fripp).

gack...when i first listened to _os_, i could have sworn that a differ-
ent version of crimson had been assembled. then i looked at the liner
notes and saw the band members. can't compare it to _saotw_ though.

&gt;How are the lyrics?  If I hear another Toyah lyric about marrying and/or
&gt;marriage, I'll puke (and I'm a happily married sort of a guy)! %)

hmmm...so far, i've really only listened for the music (i usually end up
distracted by something else when listening and all i hear is the music
anyways). i did read the lyrics to the first song and it sure didn't seem
like it was about matrimony! :)
