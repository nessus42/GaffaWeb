I got this off of some FTP site with discographies that dave datta
talks about every now and then... it is very complete... but I have
still been unable to find any pre-Kite Kirsty.  I *wish* they'd
put out *everything* on cd.  Damn those record companies.

Enjoy.

                     KIRSTY MACCOLL DISCOGRAPHY


              (copywrite Colm Mulcahy, August 1990)




    While Kirsty IS the daughter of Ewan MacColl, the deceased (as of 22/10/89) 
Scottish folkie who wrote "Dirty Old Town", "The First Time I Ever Saw Her 
Face", "Shoals Of Herring" and (literally) hundreds more, she is NOT the 
daughter of his companion since 1958, Peggy Seeger (half sister of yer man 
himself).  This is sometimes claimed by the music media in Blitain, but a check 
of any LP of Peggy's reveals that she has had three kids with Ewan, the eldest 
being Neill (born ~1959), the next Calum (~1963). Kirsty is supposed to have 
been around 20 when she started on Stiff, but her mother is some other (former?)
companion of Ewan's. Kirsty does sing backing vocals on several on Peggy's 1970s
LPs however !
	

She started on Stiff records, with a classic girl group number:

They Don't Know (About Us)/                    BUY 47 (ps),    June 1979
Turn My Motor On


You Caught Me Out                          BUY 57,  October 1979 (withdrawn)

BUY 57. This one's hard to find, basically because it was NOT released at the 
end of October 1979, or indeed at any other time. Allegedly superb, supposedly
withdrawn at last monemt as she had signed with Polydor. Planned B-side ????
A-side recorded with "most of Boomtown Rats".


Finally, decades later ....

Keep Your Hands Off My Baby (Goggin/King)/ Polydor POSP 225 (ps), February 1981
I Don't Need You


There's A Guy .........(country version)/    Polydor POSP 250, June 1981 
????????????????


The album is assembled with help from The Edge (Jane Aire's backing band) and
Billy Bremner:



DESPARATE CHARACTERS                        Polydor POLS 1035, July 1981

Clock Goes Round
See That Girl
There's A Guy Works Down The Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis
Teenager In Love
Mexican Sofa          [great tune, but they dumped it later ... keep reading !]
Until The Night
-
Falling For Faces
Just One Look
The Real Ripper
Hard To Believe
He Thinks I Still Care   [another all time girl classic, actually it's not hers]
There's A Guy Works Down The Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis (country version)



{See That Girl}                              Polydor POSP 326, September 1981
Over You




You Still Believe In Me/                     Polydor POSP 368, November 1981 
(unknown)





Far as I can tell, a pregnant silence followed. Then a single on Now records:



Berlin/                                             NOW 100, August 1983
Rhythm Of The Real Thing

 
Berlin                                              NOWX 100, August 1983
-
Rhythm Of The Real Thing
(3rd cut on 12"?)



Stiff gets sense and takes her back, for one last great single (and some duds)


Terry/                                          Stiff BUY 190 (ps), October 1983
Quietly Alone 


Terry                                               Stiff SBUY 190, October 1983
-
Quietly Alone 
(3rd cut on 12"?)




Brace yourself, Kirsty now tries for the big one, with help from producer hubby:


New England (Bragg)/                     Virgin ???????,    December 1984
Patrick
I'm Going Out With An 80 Year Old Millionaire (3rd cut on 12")


February 1985

The baby arrives (7lb 6oz), Steve Lillywhite is the daddy (he used to be married
to U2), New England becomes mega hit in parts of Europe.  Billy Bragg is almost
famous, but for all the wrong reasons.


May 1985 sees Polydor cashing in, by rereleasing the LP with alterations:

Kirsty MacColl LP

Clock Goes Round
See That Girl
There's A Guy Works Down The Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis
Teenager In Love
Annie                                     [decent "new song"]
Until The Night
Falling For Faces
Roman Gardens                         [another acceptable new one]
The Real Ripper
Hard To Believe
He Thinks I Still Care
Berlin                                     [presumably the single]


Sometime later 1985

He's On The Beach/
Please, Go To Sleep
(3rd cut on 12"?)



She helped Tracey Ullmann get a start in life, arranging, singing backing vocals
and generally doing all the work on some of her great songs, including one she
seems not to have recorded herself: the brilliantly titled You Broke My Heart In
17 Places (One Of Them Was Sheppard's Bush).

[Stiff publisher ........... old song ?!]




could the Tex Pistols be any relation of The Tex Maniacs ?  They were/are a
spin off of the first Hank Wangford Band, featuring the real Tim Renwick, a
fake Al Stewart, one Paul Riley on bass (ex-Chilly Willy &amp; The Red Hot Peppers,
Snakefinger's 70s pubrock band), and the underrated Andy Roberts (ex-Plainsong
and The Liverpool Scene, not neccesarily in that hors d'oevres WHICH MUST BE 
OBEYED AT ALL TIMES !).


Sorry Basil.



i forgot to mention before that Kirsty has done guest vocal spots for Matchbox,
the Pogues and Morrisey.  and the Stones.  and David Byrne.
