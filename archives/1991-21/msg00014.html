Vickie here.

Hi all, Chris &amp; I are at Jorn's abode of work, taking over his
computer for a bit and catching up with gaffa.

We haven't been on the net for a couple of weeks (my last post was
based on printouts that Jorn had given Chris) and the other night
Chris was able to get our mail. As I was scrolling through I saw
what was posted after the _Ecto_ and _Rearmament_ lyrics, and I
nearly screamed with embarrassment! Chris had posted the WRONG
articles and ones that I had written a long time ago were sent.

I was wondering...I couldn't figure out what in the world Richard
and Jeff were talking about when they mentioned "four month old"
reposts. Now I know! So sorry. It was miscommunication between
Chris and I that caused those to be repeated.
The first one wasn't too bad. I've even gotten responses from people
who either weren't around or somehow missed them the first time they
appeared. The second one must have seemed exceedingly silly though,
coming as it did *after* the _Rearmament_ lyrics had appeared.

Argh! I just wanted to let people know that I'm not really quite as
brain damaged as I must have seemed! The articles that should have
been posted won't be mailed, it's way too late for that. I'll just
send them on to Ecto. 

We will be having Katemas in Chicago at our house. Details will
come in the next few weeks. I hope you Champaign fans can make it.

Any _Maniac Mansion_ watchers out there? We watched it the other
night for the first time and were delighted to discover that
Mary Margaret O'Hara sings the theme song. Chris swore he saw Jane's
name in the credits for something. He also thought he saw a photo
of Kate in the guest star's dressing room (not the batch of photos
at the beginning of the show). We'll be watching the show every
week now, if we remember. 

New good album...Kirsty MacColl's new album is WONDERFUL! Anyone
who is already a Kirsty fan will be overjoyed with it. If you're
now familiar with Kirsty, she sang on The Pogues' song "Fairytale
of New York" and also had songs on the _Red, Hot &amp; Blue_ and the
soundtrack to _She's Having A Baby_. I don't have time to say much
about the album, other people will surely post more. It's called
_Electric Landlady_, quite a nice pun, since it was recorded at
the Electric Ladyland studios in NY.

I have the new Sam Phillips and T'Pau but haven't had a chance to
listen to them yet.

S'it for now. I don't intend to cause any more trouble (for a while
anyway :-) but I do want to thank those who have been patient and
reasonable about all the Happy flurry. I'm glad so many of you were
interested enough to try her out. Thanks for the thanks too!

Bye for now....

Vickie (one of Vickie'n'Chris)
