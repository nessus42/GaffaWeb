   IED saw a relative rarity of Kate colleKTing today at a swapmeet:
one of the Dutch limited-edition grey-vinyl pressings of _The_Kick_
_Inside_, in pretty good condition. Price: $60.00. This seemed a bit
low to IED, but he wonders whether anyone in this group knows more about
the relative current value of such items? Also of interest to this philo-
canine was a near-mint-condition copy of _The_Single_File_ boxed set,
which was being offered for $250.00.
   IED asked the dealer what the likelihood was of her actually _getting_
that much for it, and she told me that she had had three such sets and
that the first had gone for $150 and the second nearly as quickly for
$200. Hence $250 was her price for the third--she was evidently still
trying to determine where these nutty prices leveled off.
   Evidently so is Bleecker Bob's, a West Hollywood shop which last week
was exhibiting a _TSF_ set in comparable condition, with the asking price
of--$300. Where does it end?
   About the concert-ticket-buying problem, IED consulted with a couple
of hardened dealers in the L.A. area, and both told him that, alas! there
really doesn't seem to be any good way of ensuring the snaring of decent
tickets. One's best bet, apparently, is still to wait in line (or stake
out the area from a legal distance) hours to days ahead of box-office
sale-time. IED may be getting too old for that sort of thing--unless
some of us could get organized and arrange to alternate graveyard shifts,
etc...?
