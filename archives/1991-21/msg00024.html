In the 2nd part of KaTes MTV interview I read about KaTes performance at
"Saturday Night Live".

During the lasts weeks I have watched replays of S.N.L. on MTV (it's an
european version of MTV, isn't it?) occasionally, but of course I would
hate to miss the one featuring KaTe. On the other hand I don't want to
watch them all (in the middle of the night) just to not miss THAT one.

Is somebody able to help me find out when the one with KaTe will be shown? My
TV program doesn't even mention MTV. Does someone have a list of the shows
with their special guests, so that I can find out when about it will be?

Any help would be highly appreciated.

By the way: r.m.g. already helped me to get a recording of GLC a couple of
weeks ago. Without your information it would have been impossible.
   Thanks a lot!

I was quite suprised to find out that GLC was not a cartoon, as the "comic
strip" title implied to me. Once again I noticed that the british are doing
much better political satires than we germans are doing (although most Tories
won't enjoy it).

KaTes music suited that film (IMHO) very nicely. I think it was very clever
to let the music box play RUTH when the heroine was in the pub instead of
playing one of the new songs.

Bye, Klaus.
