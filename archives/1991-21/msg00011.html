   Hi, Love-Hounds!
   It's nice to be back. First of all, IED implores you please
_not_ to e-mail him at the above e-mail address. It is no longer
his account. IED doesn't yet have an account of his own, and hasn't
been able to access Love-Hounds since May 29, but he hopes to be able to
rejoin you all soon. Meanwhile:

   Congratulations! Love-Hounds have already contributed enough money
to the White Rose Fund to afford at least three dozen white roses in
ivy to Kate Bush's family home on Katemas, 1991. IED would like to thank
the following generous philocanines in particular: Vishal Markandey,
Michael Peskura, Ed Suranyi (hope it's not misspelled, Ed!), Laura and
Robin Clifford, and (for exceptional largesse) Rick Thompson. Thanks to
all of you.
   IED has decided to do two things. First, he would like to send along
to the florists' in England each of the little notes that the above
contributors sent along with their contributions, with the instruction
that the envelope of notes be delivered together with the roses. IED will
add to the Fund any such notes which may accompany future contributions.
The amount of the contribution is not important, but remember: the more
money contributed, the larger the bouquet will be. Wouldn't it be neat if
Love-Hounds could send _ten_ dozen roses, along with a bunch of personal
happy-birthday greetings?

   With such a result in mind, here's the second thing IED must do: he
must set an _absolute_ deadline for receipt of all contributions. The
deadline is July 5. It has to be that early because a very large special
order of white roses in ivy takes some pre-planning by the florists.
So, if you have any interest in pitching in to the Love-Hounds White Rose
Fund, please hurry--and IED will add your note to the envelope. (Please
make it short and sweet if you can!) Please be sure to get it in to IED
by July 5--any late contributions will have to be returned to sender.

   By the way: contributors should be made aware that although Love-
Hounds have sent white roses to Kate on Katemas the three previous years,
no specific acknowledgement has ever been received, so don't hold your
breath for a personal letter from her this year! Let the source of your
satisfaKTion derive from the knowledge that you have helped make the
bouquet a little bigger, and Katemas a little prettier.
   A note to the five above-named early contributors, and to any others
who have already sent in money to IED's address: you may want to send
along a short note to Kate, now that you know that IED will be forwarding
them to the florists'. IED will add them to the bunch. Failing that, if
no objections reach him, IED will add the notes that he has already
received with your contributions.

   Thanks again to all who have participated. The address for the White
Rose Fund again is:

                           Andrew Marvick
                           10499 Wilkins Avenue
                           Los Angeles, CA 90024

   If you have any further inquiries, IED's phone number is:

                            (213) 474-5208

-- Andrew Marvick
