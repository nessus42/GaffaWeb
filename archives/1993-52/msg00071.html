&gt;The Rubberband Girl single is good--Show a little devotion is
&gt;really nice to have.

I'm rather fond of "Show a Little Devotion".  It took a couple of listens
to grow on me, but I think it's quite good.

&gt;Was the MOP boxed set available in the US?

You don't want this piece of manipulative, fan-baiting shit.  I don't know
if it was EMI or Novercia/KaTe's idea, but I find it really disgusting.

The MOP box is a cardboard box 5.5"x5.25".  The cover is the same as the
regular UK single, but *slightly* larger.  At the top it states that this
"Collectors CD box set includes four colour prints."

The back of the box is the same as the back of the single liner sheet.

The box contains 4 "colour prints."  These are on a nice card stock.  One
is the cover of the box (oh boy).  Two are beautiful pics of KaTe in whcih
she's wearing a black dress.  Her hair is bound up, but not neatly (it's a
wodnerful style for her, though) and there's a colourful flower in her
hair.  One is 3/4 length, the other is a closeup of her face.  The fourth
"picture" is a lyric sheet.  It's a "colour print" only because it's got
the closeup of KaTe's feet that's inset on the back of the single and
because the title is in blue ink.  Hardly my idea of a colour print.
The prints are 5 7/8" square.

The CD itself has a different picture silkscreened on it than the UK
single.  Instead of being a version of the back of the single, it's got an
enlargement of the skeleton at the bottom right of the cover.

But it's the CONTENTS of this single that make it WORTHLESS.

The damned thing only has:  Moments of Pleasure (album version), December
Will be Magic Again (yes, the original single version such as is on the UK
MoP single), and Experiment IV.

The single does NOT contain either of the two "new" b-sides that are
included on the single in other formats (the UK single contains "Show a
Little Devotion" and the 12" contains "Home for Christmas").

If you're interested in KaTe's music and don't obssess over pictures of
KaTe, spend your money on the UK single and not the box.  There's nothing
here for the non-insane-collector.

(What am *I* doing with the box, I hear you cry?  Well, I'd already bought
the UK MoP single when a dear friend of mine returned to the US for Xmas
break from his graduate work in London and he brought me the MoP box as a
present.  I'm horrendously jealous of said friend's father--said friend
brought said father a copy of the 12" poster sleeve with "Home for
Christmas" on it.  And now I have to go buy the US "Rubberband Girl" so I
can get "Home for Christmas", even though I already have the UK "Rubberband
Girl."  Well, thank god I'm not a *real* completist...I'm just trying to
get as much of her *music* on disc as possible.  ;-)
