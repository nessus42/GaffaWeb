Daniel J. Langrill knows exactly how to perk my ears up:

&gt; I finally found Happy Rhodes!!
&gt; ...I am VERY IMPRESSED!

Oooh, magic words!

&gt; So, what's the other stuff like?  Please tell me that "Warpaint"
&gt; is Happy's WORST album, because it's so awesome!

"It's Happy's worst album" :-) (Really, I *love* it, but for various
reasons, my personal favorites are "Ecto" and "Rhodes I.")

&gt; Are "Rhodes I" and/or "Rhodes II" worth it?  I hope so, seeing that
&gt; those are the only other Happy CDs that I've seen...

You bet! (About those monsters, read the lyrics to the song "Warpaint"
and perhaps you'll understand them a bit better. You most certainly
will once you get I &amp; II. Happy painted them, btw.)

&gt; BTW, Vickie, I noticed that your name is in the "Thanks" section...

&lt;blush&gt; Someone who reads credits! Cool!

&gt; So that's why you're always selling Happy, huh? :)

When I discovered Happy, in 1988, very few people outside Albany, NY
had heard her music. I played her on my radio show, bought numerous
tapes to give away, told everybody I met about her, and in general,
tried to spread the music. Not for any personal gain (I know you 
were kidding) but because I love Happy's music, lyrics and voice
so much. Happy appreciated my efforts, and thanked me on "Warpaint."
Please remember (or know) that those credits were written after I
started talking about her on rmg, but *before* interest in her really
became widespread here. The release of "Warpaint" on CD is what
prompted more and more gaffa folks to try her out, which led to
the creation of Ecto, which led to her re-releasing her 1st 4
cassettes on CD (if you get the earlier CDs, check those credits
for "Thanks to the Ectophiles") which will, of course, lead to 
Worldwide Domination... :-)

&gt; P.S.  -- Next question -- What's the mailing address of ecto?  I'm
&gt; debating whether I have enough time on my hands to keep up with RDT,
&gt; rec.music.gaffa, AND ecto...

ecto-request@ns1.rutgers.edu (say hi to Jessica!)

Did you see my recent posting about Ecto? If not, I can send it to
you (and a FAQ) so you'll know what it's about. It's big and busy
and friendly and we talk about *everything* under the sun. Be
prepared :-)

Vickie

ps, ob KaTe: She *IS* and always will be, to me. I never would have
found Happy, Tori, Jane, Sarah or any of the others if I hadn't first
been a KaTe fan.
