&gt;Hi, fellow Love-Hounds!

&gt;It's me, the prodigal daughter -- Deb Wentorf -- after a two-year hiatus
&gt;that's left me sadly out of touch with all of you...my fellow Love-Hounds!
&gt; But fear not!  After a bit of digging, I was able to find Ed Suranyi's e-mail
&gt;address, and he was able to get me started back on the road to recovery.  =)
&gt; It's good to be back!

Hi Deb, welcome back! Thanks so much for posting your story. As I read 
these wonderful accounts I just....&lt;sigh&gt;....and wish we had been there.
Seeing Kate is really only part of the magic. Meeting other fans, old
friends, making new friends, being part of the...yes, community, is 
reason enough to want to be there. &lt;sigh&gt;

At least we were able to hear Kate on the radio tonight. All the callers
were articulate and rational, which was extraordinarily admirable,
considering that they were lucky enough to get through (we had an
auto-dialer going the whole time) and were able to speak to Kate
directly.

The very last caller asked about rec.music.gaffa and if the song
"Deeper Understanding" had been based on the group. Kate asked if
it were known under another name, but the fella never said "Love-
Hounds" so I don't *think* she put the two together. Anyway, she
said that DU wasn't based on this group.

She's so wonderful, so beautiful, so nice, and so...."vague" (IED
said it first, so I don't feel bad saying it too :-) ) but hey,
she *is* a Goddess (to me) and I love her.

Congratulations Deb (and Andy and Doug and Keith and everybody
else who just happened to *be* there) and it's good to have you back.

Vickie (one of Vickie &amp; Chris...still here after all these years)
