I don't know why I bother...

&gt;&gt; Sending harrassing e-mail, *threatening* e-mail to anyone who you have

&gt; I freely admit to using strong language in email, *always* in the
&gt; context of requests for responsibility and courage.

"Requests" for courage? Like calling someone a "FUCKING COWARD" because
they won't take your side in a dispute they have *nothing* to do with
and no interest in?  

&gt; I can only imagine two occasions that you might call threats.

Bzzzt! Wrong number.

&gt; I freely acknowledge that *I threatened to report this 
&gt; embezzlement*, 

"Embezzlement"? Give me a break.

&gt; and I will point out that I never acted on it, even to
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; this day (which you must surely have a hard time fitting to your
&gt; model of my motives).

You're a liar Jorn. You *did* act on it, and it didn't work, because
nobody cared. You tried your best to get various people's accounts
pulled, and harrassed sysadmins with your own delusions. You should
count yourself lucky that no one has yet chosen to contact *your*
sysadmin. Remember, forwarded e-mail is a *powerful* thing.

(No one can *possibly* know what this is all about, but if you insist
on it, the entire story *can* be told, and it's *not* pretty, is it?
Jorn? Would you like all these nice people to know what's behind all
this? At this point, I'd be *more* than happy to enlighten them. Perhaps
I should write it up and offer it through e-mail. "Privacy" is in the
eye of the beholder, according to your own standards. Right? Considering
that Chris and I so far declined to make the *real* story public, that
must surely give you a hard time fitting to *your* models of *our* motives.)

&gt; The other, I suspect, was telling Ron Hogan just recently that he would 
&gt; soon have to "eat his words", when he accused me of lying.  You might 
&gt; do well to look up that idiom.

Jorn, you *were* lying! Kate was never on Prodigy, and technically it was
a lie. I mean, I wouldn't have called it that, but Ron chose to do so.
*He* wasn't lying, so why should he have to "eat his words"?  Besides,
Ron *wasn't* one of the ones I was talking about. Thanks for telling me,
so I can add him to my list of people you're harrassing.

Vickie

ps, btw, Jorn, are you going to send me that e-mail correspondence you
said you'd send to anybody who wrote you? I want it, and you haven't
sent it to me yet. How could I *possibly* know if what you're sending
to other people was actually written by Chris or I?
