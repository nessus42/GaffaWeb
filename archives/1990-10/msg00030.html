 Chris here,

    Well the Option magazine interview is out, and a good one it is too.
But does anyone out there in love-hounds land have a theory about *why*
a woman with such a beautiful smile and a broad range of other expressions
constantly uses a solemn expression on magazine cover photo shoots? I use
the word "solemn" rather than "blank," the first one to spring to mind, to
avoid flamage. When the "Keyboard" magazine interview came out we were very
excited because it was such an excellent interview, but probably more happy
because we finally had a cover photo of Kate *smiling*. In our limited
contact with Kate our overall impression of her was of a happy person.
I mean at any given moment she's more likely to be smiling or laughing than
frowning. We've never even seen her angry no matter what the circumstances.
The closest she gets to it would be a state comparable to "mild pique".
And it doesn't appear to be publicity consciousness either, as we have seen
photos of her in very non-public conditions. We have photos from an Italian
photographer of Kate having her make-up applied with a positively beatific
expression on her face. This was when she was slogging around Italy lip-
syncing "The Dreaming" in twenty (well it *seems* like twenty) annoying
locations, having to put up with hosts so irritating they could drive Mother
Theresa into a kill-frenzy. No matter what she seems to maintain a positive
outlook. I hope Kate hasn't fallen victim to the modern fallacy that
happiness is less "deep" or "meaningful" than other feelings.

                                Chris of
                                   Chris'n'Vickie
                                      of Kansas City
