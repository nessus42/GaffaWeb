Hello! God I hate great competition! I had to compete with Michelle Shocked
on Austin City Limits and The Pogues on Saturday Night Live. Yikes! I set
my VCR for Michelle but I'll have to wait for the repeat to get The Pogues.
Plus the fact that it was St. Patrick's Day, I probably only had 10 people
listening :-( I really don't understand what's with St. Patrick's Day. It
seems as if half the population of the US uses it as an excuse to go out
and get drunk and act stupid and pose a menace to the rest of us! Hey, I'm
part Irish (really, I know everybody says that on St. Patrick's Day, but I
really am!) and I don't feel obligated to get drunk. It's all so silly. Hey
Declan, what do they do in Ireland on St. Patrick's Day? Do you all wear
green? I'm proud to say that I didn't wear a speck of green Saturday!
Obviously, I'm not a purist so that's reflected in the show. I had a TON
of Irish stuff but decided to focus on a few major things and throw in other
artists here &amp; there. It was a Celtic-ish kinda show though.
Album list to follow playlist.

                -------------------------------------
Macalla is a group of 23 women from Ireland. That's all I know because a
friend sent me a tape and he doesn't know anything else about them either.
It's very excellent Irish music, both vocally and instrumentally. I'm not
sure about the title of the album because the "M" in Mna could be an "N".
It's hard to read.

It's groups such as The Pogues and Boiled In Lead that make me wish
sometimes that I hadn't chosen a "women only" format. At least I can
play some of their stuff because of the songs where they've used female
musicians. Cait was The Pogues' bass player on their first two albums.
She left the band to marry Elvis Costello. Where is she now? Home cooking
for Elvis? Pshaw!

Jane Dauphin was Boiled In Lead's guitar player for their first two
albums.  I LOVE this group and if you ever get to see them live, don't
pass it up. Their blend of World Beat/Ethnic/Celtic Rock is great on 
record, but twice as good live. The band is from Minneapolis and the
bass player, Drew Miller, has a show on Minneapolis' Community station
(I forget the call letters). The whole band, but Drew especially, likes
Kate and the last time they played here Drew told me that they were in 
London for Trio Bulgarka's show. They went backstage after the show and
were amazed when they saw Kate walk by! I don't think he talked to her
but I do believe he was thrilled to see her in person.
I think they're on tour now so keep an eye out!
