&gt;&gt;Has anyone out there ever heard of the Bobs?  They are a brilliant
&gt;&gt;avant-garde a capella group.  I recently found a cd of theirs called
&gt;&gt;My, I'm Large.  Apparently there is also one called New Wave Music.
&gt;&gt;But their first album, The Bobs, doesn't seem to be out on CD.  Or is it?

&gt;Yes!  The bobs are one of my favorites too!  Here's an almost-complete
&gt;discography of their work:

&gt;Out of the Mouths of Bobs --limited edition ep/single that's impossible to get
&gt;The Bobs (1982) -- first album, available on CD (which includes a couple of
&gt;  bonus tracks, like their remake of "Psycho Killer")
&gt;My I'm Large (1987)
&gt;Songs For Tomorrow Morning (1988)

&gt;They may have a new album out... I called their concert information line
&gt;( 415-THE-POOP ) in February and they said they were in the studio recording
&gt;a new album... So, who knows.

At a concert in November, they claimed that an album of covers
(including "Ring of Fire") was released in Italy. I think they said it
was called (through no fault of their own) "The Bobs Sing". But I've
been unable to confirm that it exists, much less acquire a copy.

They've appeared on The Tonight Show at least once (singing "Johnny's
Room") and have a PBS special (The Lonesome Pines special?) with Iso,
a dance troupe they tour with sometimes. I haven't seen the PBS
special, though.

If you ever get a chance to see a Bobs concert, go! Probably your only
chance to hear "Purple Haze" or "Ina Gadda Da Vida" as a capella.

Another interesting a capella group is "The Flying Pickets", who have
several albums (not available on CD, as far as I know), including
"Lost Boys" and "Live at the Albany Empire". The Pickets are
Australian(?), and split between original (as far as I know) songs and
covers, including "Summertime", "Remember This", and "Get Off of My
Cloud". Worth trying to locate. Oops, they also did "Psycho Killer".
