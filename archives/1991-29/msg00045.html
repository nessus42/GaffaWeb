Vickie here.

Oh Bard, I'm sorry for ye.

This might get me kicked out of the net.secondary.goddess club :-)
but I honestly do feel sorry for anyone who doesn't really like
TSW. God knows I'm not going to get into another "magic" debate
and I'll say that, yes, feeling magic from an artist or an album
is a very individual thing (happy Jon?) but I just know how wonderful
TSW makes me feel, the glow I feel after listening to it, the magic
it holds for me. I can't help but say it's a shame that everyone
doesn't feel the same magic I feel. Knowing that "Reaching Out"
causes some people to feel distain and scorn, when it makes my
heart ache in its beauty and passion, is painful.

Many people gave Kate up after TSW came out.

It was their choice, it was their loss.

If Kate turns into "Catherine" completely, you'll give her up.

Your choice, your loss.

It's just too bad that Kate won't consult you before she releases
her next album, to make sure it meets your "standards" of what
she should do. I'm sure she'd be happy to re-record it to fit 
your perception of what you think she should be doing. I'm sure it
would be enlightening for her to know that you think she should
stay at one level and never change or try different things. Hell,
she might as well just give up recording altogether, then you'd
never be disappointed. 

The Dreaming is my all-time favorite album, followed closely by
The Ninth Wave. Would I like to see her just record more Dreamings
over and over again? Of course! Am I disappointed that she's not?
No! Because, I love TSW and treat it as a separate album and listen
to it on its own terms, and don't compare it to any of the others.
I can't for the life of me understand why some people can't do the
same. If you don't like it, fine. Too bad. Tough. Sorry. For you.
Maybe someday the *emotions* in the album will win you over.
Maybe not. Oh well, different strokes...

Btw, I think "Walk Straight Down The Middle" is a brilliant, beautifu,
emotional and moving song. It's one of my very favorite b-sides.
