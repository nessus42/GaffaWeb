Kate's Birthday
---------------
With Andy Peebles, Radio 1 
July 30, 1982 

[Transcribed by Ron Hill.  Thanks to IED for providing me with the tape]

        I: Many happy returns to you. 
        K: Thank you! 
        I: I'm not going to be personal and ask how old you are 'cause that's
very cheeky, have you had a good day? 
        K: It's been lovely, thank you. 
        I: Am I allowed to be inquisitive and ask what's the best present
you've had so far? 
        K: Gosh!  Well I haven't had very many 'cause I haven't any of my
friends...
        I: Hmm..
        K: But, ah....
        I: Is this a complaint, Kate, or a statement? [Laughs]
        K: Oh, not it's not a complaint at all, cause I've had some lovely
ones already, it's just I've hardly had any yet. 
        I: What sort of things do you like for your birthday?  I mean for
people who know Kate Bush they may be sat their thinking "I wonder what Kate
would like me to get her for her birthday?"  I mean what sort of things do you
appreciate, silly things?
        K: Well I think the thing that's most important is that the person
shows that people have actually thought about you, and I think that's the
thing that I find the most moving thing.
        I: I wouldn't know what to get you, you see.  I've been sat here
thinking "what would I buy Kate if I knew her well enough to buy her a
present?" [Kate laughs]  But it's very nice to have you on the program.  Kate,
tell me about your new single The Dreaming, which I must admit I find
fascinating. 
        K: Oh, you do!
        I: Yes, I do.  
        K: Oh, good.  Well really it's a song about the Australian Aborigines
who've been treated incredibly badly by the white man...
        I: Hmm.
        K: ...but It doesn't just apply to Aborigines, I think we've done our
fair share of being cruel to people.  And certainly to the red Indians in
America, all this sort of thing. 
        I: So it's a bit of a social statement. 
        K: It is, but thank God the Aborigines are getting themselves together
again.  There all starting to grow, there are much more of them now then there
were even a few years ago. 
        I: Found yourself a wonderful, isn't it, the Aborigines getting
themselves together.
        K: Yeah.
        I: Down under in the Antivities [??? spelling].  Kate, when can we see
you touring again, cause lot's of people love watching your concerts, when are
you going to be on the road again. 
        K: Well, I think that I can't really say at this point in time.  I
really do want to do another tour, badly.  But, um... ah, well.... from the
way the last one was it just cost so much money and so much effort and time to
get it together, that it needs an incredible amount of preparation, really. 
I'm just trying to see when is the first time that I can realisticly fit it
in. 
        I: Well, I'm sure when you've got it prepared and organized they're be
ques of people hunting for tickets and enjoying your shows. 
        K: Oh, I hope so...
        I: It's been lovely taking to you, very many happy returns and have a
super birthday. 
        K: Thank you very much.
        I: And here comes that lovely record.  See you soon, bye! 

[Tape cuts]

        K: ...see you! 
        I: There we are, Kate Bush, on the telephone line and this is The
Dreaming. 

[The Dreaming is played]
