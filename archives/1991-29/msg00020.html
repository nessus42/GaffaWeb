Aloha, and it's nice to see this digest up again!  If it weren't for the
Bulletin Board on GEnie, I would have felt truly isolated.  Hope everybody survived
the downtime!  Anyway, I'd love to see more ides and opinions here about
lyrical content, as there is a whole world of things to discuss in KaTe's
music.  I enjoyed all the stuff about "Kashka From Baghdad".... I never
thought about the possibility of Kashka being female.... must be my own
personal sexuality that closed my eyes to ths.(that) possibility.
By the way, does anybody out there have the lyrics to "The Handsome Cabin
Boy"?  I can figure most of them out, but a few lines make a complete
interpretation of the song difficult.  (Why isn't my backspace working???
Aaaarrghhh!!!)  Also, is the lyric in "Ken" saying "Who is the funky sex machine"
or maybe something a bit more.... colloquial?  I must admit that some of the subject
matter in her work that isn't usually seen in music are the songs I find the most moving,
particularly the songs "The Kick Inside" and "The Infant Kiss"... simply
incredible!!!   Anyhow, I'm not feeling especially eloquent tonight, so I'll
get out of here... Oh, and by the way, if somebody could give me some sources
for looking for apartments in Chicago (perticularly Rogers Park), I would be 
most appreciative!!!  I plan to move there in Early March of '92, so I still
have a little while... but no sense putting it off!!  Meanwhile, so long and Aloha
from Honolulu!!  Any vacationers coming our way, just let me know... we
could plan a post-Katemas celebration!!! Bye for now!!
