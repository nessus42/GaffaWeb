Chris here,

&gt; Ummm... I can understand that your argument against the rest of the
&gt; posts you replied to might have gotten you a little carried away.. so
&gt; I ask you to please relax, calm down, and re-read what Chris wrote.
&gt; 
&gt; All he's doing is making a comment on the use of the term "personal
&gt; relationship" which to me makes a point exactly the opposite of what
&gt; you seem to think it makes! Of course, chris please do feel free to
&gt; tell us which one is interpreting closer to how you meant it. (I tend
&gt; to think of "personal relationship with Christ" of Christians to be a
&gt; bit silly.. so i am definitely biased by that). But I got the
&gt; impression that Chris feels it's a tad silly too, and all he was
&gt; saying is that while we might think it's a bit silly a LOT of people
&gt; take it most deadly seriously, and they certainly cannot even claim to
&gt; have even become an "aquaintance" of Christ by meeting him in person
&gt; even once.

   Exactly.
   Oh dear, I fear that either my sense of humor has become far too dry
for general consumption or the nationwide uptightness has resulted in a
"humor drought" among others. Some friends of ours have a small crystal
orb that they call "god". They don't _literally_ mean that this small
crystal orb is the Lord and Creator of All Creation. It's just a small
bit of mildly blasphemous fun and a play on the foolishness of many of the
"New Agers". I find this sort of thing funny; your mileage may vary.
   All I meant was: I have met my Hero(ine) and have not found her wanting
(other than for height).

                            Chris Williams of
                                Chris'n'Vickie of Chicago
                                    katefans@chinet.chi.il.us

P.S. Anyone who is having trouble understanding something I wrote, please,
   write for an explanation. It was probably meant to be humorous.
