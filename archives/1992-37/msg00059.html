Hi Love Hounds and Ectophiles,

Well, FINALLY! I finally found a store that had a Happy Rhodes
CD - and they let me sample it (they only had Warpaint though-
but this is a step in the right direction, I suppose).
After listening (actually - were not listening here we are
reading, arn't we) to all the discussion about this Happy
person, Happy vs. Kate, Kate vs. Happy, Happy doing Kate (not
to mention Tori vs. Kate, Kate vs. Tori, Tori's piano capabilities
vs. Kates, etc......) I have been on a mission  to find Happy's
music, so I was very "happy" when I found that one lone CD.  
For anyone who lives near Baltimore and may be looking I found
Warpaint a place in Towson called AN DIE MUSIK (german maby),
1 Investment Place, Towson, MD  410-2.9.MUSIC.

FUNNY STORY

Well, there I was with this warpaint CD in hand, so I asked the
salesperson if I could hear it and low and behold they actually
had 2 CD/Headphone sampling areas.....I put on the head phones and
began to listen.  In the background, (outside of my headphones),
the store had a hauntingly familiar female vocalist playing. And
I thought, who is that playing---while at the same time I was trying
to hear and concentrate on Happy....but I had to keep pulling away 
the headset to also listen to that female vocalist playing---so
I went over to the counter to see what the CD was  that was Currently
being played and wouldn't you all know it, it was T___ ! (Did you guess,
??)  Yes it was Tori.  After all this dialog about Tori and Happy I thought
it a bit ironic that when I actually did find Happy's music Tori was
playing at the same time. (Does anyone else think that is odd)?  Big
deal most of you may say-but, I have only heard Ms.Tori on the radio so
I don't really know her stuff that well, therefore, I was, needless to
say also interested in hearing her music as well.  So, I was comparing
and contrasting Tori at the same time that I was hearing Happy while
somewhere in the back far reaches of my mind I was thinking "Kate/is
this Katelike/Kate,Kate,Kate).

ANALYSIS/OPINION
 
Ok, here goes.  Happy Rhodes, my immediate reaction was...............
......................................................................
um, uhm............... Now Tori on the other hand......................
...............captured me, yes - thats a good way to put it her music
was capturing, I will buy Little earthquakes, definately.  Oh, yeah
Happy....................Well, I liked her music.  I like most female
artists (I said most, not all).  I like anything from folk-Joan Armatrating
(did I murder her name) to Siouxsie, to Cocteau Twins, to Enya (and I used
to really like/now my opinion probably wouln't be respected anymore
when I say this artist, but what are opinions for anyway/this was before
I knew what else was out in the world/Stevie Nicks---ouh, oh, ouu-I can
feel the rocks and bitter curses).  

But with Happy I found myself listening for her to sound like Kate.  Now
maby this is unfair.  Maby I should just have been listening for her to
sound like Happy but if I was listening for her to sound like Kate it
is all of YOURRRRR faults ("smile" now/this is all in good humor).  

I found "Lay me down" and "Words weren't made for Cowards" to sound
very very much like Ms. Bush.  Happy finds that high clear sweet 
crystal Kate like pitch that so attracts me to Kate.  The other songs
were all very throaty and the pitch was flatter (not high a clear), but
I like flat, I guess I just like high, and clear more.  I would buy
Warpaint (I will buy warpaint) but first I would like to hear her
older stuff, Rhodes I, II, Rearmament, and then Ecto.  I would also
(will also) buy Little Earthquakes first and if Kate produces in early
93, say January 93 I would buy Kate before Tori or Happy, but only
because I know and love Kates music dearly - I think Tori and Happy
have the potential with me (say in 5 years, thats how long Ive know
of Kate) to be long lasters-well see.

Hope I have amused you all and not disturbed any.  Just had to share.

**Has any one ever heard of either of these two artists.

 - Bell Canto   &gt;Unicorn

 -P.J. Harvey   &gt;Dress

I have caught both of them only quickly on a college radio station
before they faded out - sounded good.

I swear Bell Canto sounded like the lead from the Cocteau Twins and
P.J. harvey  was a folksey mix of Vega/10,000 M's and the lead singer
from the Throwing Muses.

Bye All

"Don't put your foot on the heartbreak".

(The salesperson from AN DIE MUSIK did confirm that about two years
ago our own Ms. Bush did fly to the states, CA or somewhere like that,
for some special reason - was it recording purposes?  He said that
his buddy went to where ever she was to get a bunch of autographs from
her).
