Kate Bush appeared on the Wogan show last night on BBC 1 (IED's source
of information about this being spot on).

Kate did a lip-synch to This Woman's Work. I have not had a chance
to compare the song on the show with the recorded versions but it seemed
much less orchestrated. The overdubbed vocals near the end were present
but the early sections of the song were much sparser. This song is
rapidly becoming one of my favourites of hers - it's hard to stop the
odd tear forming in the eyes, especially watching Kate's emotive
performance of it.

The set was just Kate at the piano surrounded by a few pillars, lit by blue
light and with a little dry ice. Kate was dressed in a long black dress,
blacket jacket, white blouse, and black bow-tie. Kate's hair was formed
into a long pony-tail wrapped with a scarf.  The really odd thing was
that her long laced boots were placed right in front of the piano stool
(Kate played barefoot) and given the simple nature of the set, the boots
dominated the scene - it was almost surreal! (Rather like football fans
being told to remove their "bovver boots" before entering the ground).

Terry Wogan seemed genuinely delighted to have her on the show and
commented that it had been ages since she was last on. He also mentioned
that the album had gone platinum.
