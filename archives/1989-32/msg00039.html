For unknown reasons, Andrew (IED) Marvick felt compelled to pointificate
as follows:

&gt;The _only_
&gt;positive data we have about the placement of the laugh is to
&gt;be found in the _British_ edition of the CD. It constitutes the sole
&gt;legitimate source of information any of us has to go on. And _it_
&gt;connects the laugh with _Love_and_Anger_. Any other supposition at
&gt;this stage--whether it should turn out to be correct or not--is made
&gt;without any tangible evidence at all.

As far as I can tell, IED, this belief of yours -- that the British CD
is more correct than the US version, or corresponding single -- is based
on the assumption that it was supervised by Kate.  I, for one, find it
extremely far-fetched that an artist, even one as concerned with detail
as Kate, actually oversees such a mundane part of the mastering process
as the location of index points.  Unless you have definitive inside 
information that she did supervise the indexing, I think we have to say
that any supposition, one way or the other, is made without tangible
evidence.

IED also responds to Steve Tynor's quite rational comments thusly:

&gt;     In regard to this idiotic trend among you and your ilk to criticize
&gt;a work of art like _The_Sensual_World_ via factually vapid, musically
&gt;ignorant and fundamentally boorish insults of both the music and those
&gt;who are capable of appreciating it: go right ahead. You convince no one
&gt;but yourselves. IED for one sees no hope of elucidating you and your
&gt;fellow fickle cynics about the myriad facets of _TSW_'s perfection.
&gt;If your ears can't perceive them, IED's words will go unheard, as well.
&gt;So go right ahead--continue to embarrass yourselves with your absurd
&gt;checklists of alleged "flaws" in _TSW_: you're just whistling away
&gt;in the dark void of your own ignorance.

This is quite a textbook example of argumentem ad hominem, IED.  You
might has well have added a "your momma" to it.  Factually vapid?
Such as "I don't like it"?  To declare that anything Kate does is
perfect by definition is the true foolishness.  I do not listen to
Kate's music searching for flaws, but if there are things I do not
like, I don't assume that it is my own ignorance or lack of taste.
Such thinking is for the truly insecure, for whom having opinions
of their own is just too intimidating.
