I don't really want to enter the flame war currently going on in Gaffa,
but...

We've all (or nearly all) enjoyed many of Andrew Marvick's informative,
interesting and sometimes witty postings over the years.  He has created a
character (alter-ego), IED, who clearly believes KT is God.  It is often
difficult to tell Andrew Marvick and IED apart, but are not the two clearly
distinguishable?  IED has not taken too kindly to criticisms of TSW, but this
is quite understandable.  Some of IED's comments have been rather insulting,
but is there not a hint of sarcasm?  Are we really to believe that the
author, Andrew Marvick, agrees whole-heartedly with all of IED's sentiments?

It should not be forgotten that Andrew Marvick himself (or was it IED? :-)
was one of the first to criticise TSW after the initial jubilation and sense
of awe at what we would all surely agree is still a very good album.

Like many love-hounds, I was thunderstruck when I first heard TSW - all these
beautiful and highly original songs.  Due to a slight mishap, I found myself
without a hi-fi for a few weeks and couldn't believe that we didn't all
consider it the best album that KT (or anybody else for that matter) has
created.  TSW does seem to mellow a little with time, and I acknowledge that
I am not as fond of it after a couple more listens, but I still find it hard
to believe that anybody who listens to it for the first time would not be
impressed.  No wonder TSW has received many good reviews!
