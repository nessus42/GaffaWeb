&gt;Subject: KT NEWS
&gt;     Kate Bush will appear on UK's _The_Wogan_Show_ _this_week_,
&gt;probably to perform _This_Woman's_Work_. All UK Love-Hounds are
&gt;_commanded_ to watch and (if possible) record!

You betcha! This is extremely valuable info. Many thanks to IED
as I would not normally bother to watch Wogan and the Radio Times
and newspapers rarely tell you who will be on the show. All I know
is that Nancy Raygun is on tonight's show. Guess I will have to watch
in case Kate is on as well - how one suffers for art :-)

&gt;Subject: Re: The Laugh


&gt;&gt;In fact, it's obvious to anyone who isn't Dan Quayle that it belongs at the
&gt;&gt;end of "Love and Anger".
&gt;I am not Dan Quayle (at least I wasn't last time I checked - let me
&gt;have a quick peek... nope, definitely do not have tapioca between my
&gt;ears so I can't be him...) and I don't agree with you.  The laugh is
&gt;the perfect introduction to "The Fog." A giggle at a half-remembered
&gt;childhood foible, like being scared of the water.  A piquant chuckle
&gt;of bemusement over the naivete of youth.  Of course, we're not like
&gt;that anymore, but cast your mind back... (cue Fairlight whistles).
&gt;See what I mean?  Perfection.

No. I would not classify the laugh as either a giggle or a chuckle by
a child/adolescent but rather an extremely vibrant and confident
(in fact almost over-confident and verging into hysterical)
full-blown laugh of an adult.

&gt;Besides, if you're so clever, how come the laugh ain't in the video or
&gt;on the CD or cassette single?

Because they were made for the US market and who knows who
got their grubby little hands on them somewhere in the production.

&gt;Subject: Re: The Laugh
&gt;The connection I see is due to the nervous feel of the laugh. (yes I
&gt;know that is very subjective and you might not think it such).

You are certainly correct  - it is *very* subjective and as you can see
from above I take the opposite view. Guess this is what helps to make
Kate's work so interesting: even the smallest details are cause for
debate.

Well, off to see what old Tel comes up with.
Neil
