 &gt; Last week's edition of the (West) German newsweekly
 &gt; Der (?) Spiegel has a box pic of Kate with a few
 &gt; paragraphs commenting on _Heads We're Dancing_. My
 &gt; German wasn't good enough to translate it, and now my
 &gt; friend has taken his magazine back. But if anyone wants
 &gt; to find it, the issue has a picture of the Berlin stuff
 &gt; on the cover.

That would be the 13. November 1989 issue (page 310), the first
edition following the opening of the borders.

Here is a (mostly literal) translation of said blurb:

Kate Bush, 31 (photo), English pop-singer with a predilection for
intricate music, apologized as a precaution against possible
historical misunderstandings. On her latest album "The Sensual
World" she sings in a title "Heads We're Dancing" of dancing
through a night in 1939 with Adolf Hitler. Only through a newspaper
photograph in the morning does the night reveler learn the true
identity of her charmer. Kate Bush on the unsuspecting dancer:
"The woman hereafter believes she could have influenced him and
might have changed the course of history, had she recognized him.
Of course there's no reason for her to blame herself. Adolf Hitler
fooled a lot of people, and I don't believe anyone can blame
them for that." A friend, who told of a encounter with a witty
and well-read man, provided the inspiration for her song; only
after the fact did he -- shocked and furious about the incident --
learn that he had been speaking with J. Robert Oppenheimer -- the
father of the atomic bomb. "The devil", sings Kate Bush, "is a
charming man."

(The photo is pretty standard stuff. Black and white, about 2.5 x
4", of her sitting on a typical photographer's set ,her legs tucked
under and upper body well posed. Hair is short, likely tied back.
Wearing faded jeans and a black tank-top. Possibly barefoot, but
cannot really tell.)
