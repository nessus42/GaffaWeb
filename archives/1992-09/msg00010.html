I don't know what's going on with gaffa, but all the articles are coming
through from "daemon@apple.com (wizard's assistant)" so it is increasingly
important that people sign their posts with their names and email
addresses!

I have no idea who wrote this:
&gt;     Does anyone have any recommendations for a good Kate book as far as
&gt;photography is concerned?  I'm not really interested in text (love-hounds
&gt;has more info than any author ever will have (besides Herself,)) just
&gt;photography.  Any stand-outs?

Get the Cann &amp; Mayes book "Kate Bush: A Visual Documentary."  As the title
might lead you to believe, it's highly picture-oriented.  The text is a bit
iffy, but it's quite a pretty book.  Coffee-table sized, as they say.

Non kate-related flamage ahead.  Press `n' now.

&gt;     100% of what I'm saying is that tact can support and augment what you
&gt;have to say.  That, finally, is your choice, but it has nothing to do with
&gt;_what_ you're saying, but _how_.  It's not a comprimise, it's a choice and
&gt;decision you have made, apparently without knowing _how_ you choose or made
&gt;that decision.

Bugger that for a lark.  If you can't pick out what my meaning is between
the slurs, swears and innuendo, then tough bologna on you, buddy.

&gt;     Yes.  If I could ask, please take this to email.

Ah, it must be Ken.  Hi there!  I don't have your email address, so it's
getting posted.  Besides, the first part is of general interest.

&gt;     Doesn't UUCP suck?

It's better than pony express.  But not by much.
