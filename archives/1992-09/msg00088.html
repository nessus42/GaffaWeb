        Somebody talked about The Hammersmith Show being too simular to the 
first two albums.  I couldn't disagree more!  Some of us like that recording 
much more then we like the first albums.  I have a cassette tape made off 
the video and I listen to that more then the first two albums. 

        THIS IS FOR GRAHAM: Sorry about posting this publicly but direct 
mail to Graham is currently messed up.  

        Graham, does your "zardoz" account still work?  Thanks for the first 
interview.  Unfortunately, I already have it!  Apparently it's an edited 
reprint of a British mag interview.  Sorry you had to type it in.  At least 
I can now take it off the list.  In the future, you might want to post them 
to GAFFA so everyone can enjoy them and I'll get them from there.  You also 
might want to try just sending me the first Kate quote from the interview 
and I'll tell you if it's a reprint.

        Here's the corrections: 

        "Ram" (Australia).  Nov. 17, '78, by Debbie Baer.  (Note its actualy 
NOV.  I don't recognize the name of the interviewer so it's probably not 
just a reprint. 

        "West Australian Magazine".  Dec. 9, '89, by Unk'n, 3 page cover 
story.  (Note it's not WESTERN.  Homeground has this as the date.  Since 
they had it listed with other interviews from December, it's probably the 
day of the month that is wrong, though I don't know what it should be.  :-( 
)

        My tape player is still broken (like everything else in my life, so 
I can't say when I'll get the tape to you.  But I will!  :-)
