Poi Dog Pondering and They Might Be Giants, I-Beam, San Francisco
5 November 1988

I hadn't been to the I-Beam in a few months, so I was pleasantly
surprised to find they had remodeled the interior.  It's now decorated
in a Russian American motif, with fabric-covered onion-dome frames
hanging from the ceiling, big red stars hanging over the stage,
pictures of Lenin on the walls, and other symbols of the new age of
cooperation and togetherness.  Wow.

They also removed some walls and a video booth that used to take up
part of the dance floor, so things were opened up a bit, more room for
everybody.  The stage had a short runway added on, too.  Much nicer,
in my opinion.

The crowd was pretty mellow, my kind of show.

I had never heard of Poi Dog Pondering until the week before the show,
and then it was only the fact that I read their name in the paper.
They are a seven-piece band.  Their method frontman sang, played
guitar, marimba, wood block, and frying pan.  They also had a rhythm
guitarist, bassist, mandolinist, violinist, drummer, and trombonist.
The horn player also played trumpet, accordion, tambourine and prayer
bells.  The bassist sang, played some percussion, and played guitar on
one song.  The mandolinist also played guitar and bass.  I was
dissapointed that the violinist didn't play on all the songs.

They did about nine songs, six of which are on an eponymously titled
EP recently released on Texas &lt;mumble&gt; Records (I don't remember the
name), which is based in Los Angeles.  I don't know where the band is
from, but the lead singer said he was from Hawaii, so...

The music was an interesting mix of "ethnic" rock (a la Shadowfax)
styles and straightforward American pop, and they did one harder rock
song.  The lead singer had some David Byrne mannerisms, but they
didn't detract from the fun they were having.  I really enjoyed the
show, and it looked like they were enjoying it, too.  The band was
really together (and in tune).  Recommended.

Ok, then they ripped apart the stage and set it back up for They Might
Be Giants.  Nothing new here, almost nothing on the stage except
monitors and the guitar amp.  Same old heads hanging above the stage
(but the middle one was too low and John Flansburgh hit his head on it
three or four times).  They came out after about 45 minutes (it was
midnight by this time).

They started off with the standard taped intro, and then did "Ana Ng".
After that they started taking requests, alternating between songs
that they had taped backup for, and songs they just played.
Basically, the same show they did last time thru the BayArrhea.  Lots
of fun, in any case, even when John Linnell slipped and fell down
during his accordion solo (looked like it mighta hurt a bit).  John F.
played lots of distorted and out-of-tune solos and let an audience
member pick a solo.  It sounded terrible, what fun.

A good time was had by all.

    The sun is a mass of incandescent gas,
    A gigantic nuclear furnace,
    Where hydrogen is built into heli-um
    at a temperature of millions of degrees.
        "Why Does the Sun Shine?"
        They Might Be Giants
