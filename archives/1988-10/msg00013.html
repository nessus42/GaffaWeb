According to the latest issue of Homeground, "Kate has finally finished the
basic recording of the tracks for KB VI, and the final mix down is well under
way." They predict that the album will be released in March and that there
might (with luck) be a single in February.

There is also news that Juby's book 'The Whole Story' has not been well
received by Kate's family, with John Carder Bush decribing it as a "rip-off".
Kate has not approved nor cooperated with the book. The issue includes
IED's full review of the book (as appeared in a recent Lovehounds). Well done.
There are also shorter reviews of 'Kate Bush with Love' and 'Kate Bush - a
Visual Documentary'; which despite some reservations they basically
recommend.

One interesting feature is a warning that they expect a new bootleg to 
appear very shortly which will claim to contain material from Kate's
new album. Homeground state that they are 95% certain that this record will
not contain tracks from KB VI. Very curious - what is this mysterious
disc?

There is also mention of another bootleg that looks very interesting, 
called 'Kate Bush Live in Japan'. A 7" containing a live performance of 'Moving'
at the 1978 Tokyo Song Festival and her cover versions of two Beatles songs
'She's leaving Home' and 'The Long and Winding Road' performed on TV in
Japan at the same time. "A treasure".

Neil.
