&gt;From: Geoff Clare &lt;mcvax!root.co.uk!gwc@uunet.UU.NET&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;In fact, Kate earned no fewer than 10 "O"-levels, which is an
&gt;&gt;exceptionally good performance.&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I think IED's (lack of) knowledge of the British education system 
&gt;may be letting him down here.  In the British Grammar schools of
&gt;Kate's school-days a significant proportion of pupils would pass 9
&gt;or 10 `O' levels.  It was common to take Maths or English (or both) a
&gt;year early, then the usual 8 `O' levels in the final year (including
&gt;an "Alternative" `O' level in the subject(s) already passed).  So Kate
&gt;may have 2 Maths and 2 English `O' levels and 6 in other subjects.

At my grammar school it was not common to take O-levels a year early. Though
I think with the higher standards and greater variety of subjects this has
now become more common. It is perhaps possible that instead of doubling up
in subjects Kate might have taken some of the more esoteric (at that time)
O-level subjects such as Art, Music, RI, Domestic Studies in addition to
the normal quota of academic subjects.

&gt;Without knowing the grades Kate obtained it is impossible to judge
&gt;whether her results were indeed "exceptional" (IMHO 6 or more A
&gt;grades out of the 10 would merit this description) or just "reasonably
&gt;good" (a lot of C grades - the lowest "pass" grade).

At the time Kate took her exams they may still have been using the numeric
grading system for O-levels (1-8 scale). I am not sure when they
changed to the A-F scale (which has been used at A-level for a fair while).
I obtained 5 grade 1's and would not consider myself exceptional (but of
course you are, I hear you cry!) and it was not so unusual to read of star
pupils obtaining a full set of grade 1's.

Recently there has been a programme on Radio 4 where "celebrities" have
been discussing their old school reports with an interviewer. Perhaps
one day Kate will appear on such a show and reveal all (exams-wise that is).

Neil.
