&gt;Poi Dog Pondering and They Might Be Giants, I-Beam, San Francisco
&gt;5 November 1988
&gt;
&gt;I had never heard of Poi Dog Pondering until the week before the show,
&gt;and then it was only the fact that I read their name in the paper.
&gt;They are a seven-piece band.  Their method frontman sang, played
&gt;guitar, marimba, wood block, and frying pan.  They also had a rhythm
&gt;guitarist, bassist, mandolinist, violinist, drummer, and trombonist.
&gt;The horn player also played trumpet, accordion, tambourine and prayer
&gt;bells.  The bassist sang, played some percussion, and played guitar on
&gt;one song.  The mandolinist also played guitar and bass.  I was
&gt;dissapointed that the violinist didn't play on all the songs.
&gt;
&gt;They did about nine songs, six of which are on an eponymously titled
&gt;EP recently released on Texas &lt;mumble&gt; Records (I don't remember the
&gt;name), which is based in Los Angeles.  I don't know where the band is
&gt;from, but the lead singer said he was from Hawaii, so...
&gt;
&gt;The music was an interesting mix of "ethnic" rock (a la Shadowfax)
&gt;styles and straightforward American pop, and they did one harder rock
&gt;song.  The lead singer had some David Byrne mannerisms, but they
&gt;didn't detract from the fun they were having.  I really enjoyed the
&gt;show, and it looked like they were enjoying it, too.  The band was
&gt;really together (and in tune).  Recommended.


I second this recommendation.  I saw these folks a couple of months ago
and really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately when I saw them it was a really 
small crowd.  I commend your efforts to name all the instruments these
people played.  I get the impression that the lineup is not very constant.
When I saw them they had a girl dedicated to percussion.  In fact they had
alot of interesting percussion, as you kind of implied with your list above.

Their EP is on Texas Hotel Records and they are from Austin (I'm pretty
sure).  I would be surprised if T.H.R. is based in LA, its probably based
somewhere in Texas.  I picked up the EP at the show and I've grown to
really like it.  Its a bit more subdued and less varied than I remembered
their live show being, but the songs have really grown on me.  They aren't
your typical pop song structure, but they kind of have a classic pop feel.
I often find myself singing along. 

If anyone is interested, I can get the address of Texas Hotel Records off
the back of the EP.  I'm sure they wouldn't mind selling you a copy of it,
or passing along tour info.

You can email me at the address below.
Do any of our Austin friends know more about these guys?
