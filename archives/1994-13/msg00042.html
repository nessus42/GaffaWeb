&gt;&gt;1. The Hounds of Love.

  &gt;Running Up That Hill was probably the first song I ever heard by her and
  &gt;it still is one of my all time favorites. It is so sad. I love the
  &gt;realization that you are always alone. No matter how close you are to
  &gt;someone, you are alone.


&gt;&gt;I just thought that I could motivate a little talk instead of all this 
&gt;&gt;bickering that is going on.

Well said, Aaron.  And speaking of RUTH, over the weekend I found and rented a 
copy of The Third Secret Policeman's Ball, the Amnesty International 
comedy/music charity show.  There are several of these featuring John Cleese and
other Pythons as well as other British comedians.  On this particular volume, 
Kate performs RUTH with a little help from David Gilmour.  The sound is muddy 
and the camera wanders all over the stage, but it is still worth seeing.  Kate 
even looks like she is having fun with the performance.   

I don't think this has tape has been in circulation for too long; at least I've 
never seen it.  The video store I rented it from specializes in foreign films 
(Le Video on 9th Ave. in San Francisco, IMHO the best video store in SF) and 
carries a lot of English movies and BBC programs in particular.  They have two 
shelves devoted to Michael Powell!    

My last thought regarding RUTH, has anyone else noticed that its the only Kate 
song that receives any radio airplay at all, even on "alternative" stations?  
The week after TRS was released I heard RUTH played, but nothing from the new 
album.
