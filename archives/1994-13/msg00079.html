&gt;Personally, I think it is harmless enough - it isn't as though the author
&gt;(notice how I don't mention who wrote it? :-)

Right on!

&gt;I have these CDs at home. They are by this female singer named Kate Bush (or
&gt;something like that.) Maybe you all have heard of her? I know that not very
&gt;many of my friends have. I thought it would be interesting to talk about her
&gt;for once...

&gt;1. The Hounds of Love.

This is her best album in my opinion. The b-side is fantastic.
Whenever I hear Under Ice I realize that my heart is not completly
made of stone. 
I love it when an artist make theme-albums. It gives us something more
than just the music. Back in the "good old days" when I played in Rock- and 
Blues-band, we played two covers, and made them part of a thread by writing
a third one to connect them. It was pretty facinating doing it, and see our
fans liking it. KaTe must have enjoyed putting *that* album together, more 
than any other album.

Although I am displeaesed by KaTe's performance on The Red Shoes,
I consider Big Stripey Lie among her top ten. I haven't had the opportunity
to see TLTCTC, but I still wonder... I don't think I'm going to like it that 
much. The songs on the album has too week connections to eachother IMHO 
to make a good video/movie.
