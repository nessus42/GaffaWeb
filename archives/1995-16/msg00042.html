To which I reply:

rec.music.gaffa is for admirers of not only Kate Bush (though it is the
focus) but also like-minded female artists.  In fact, the rec.music.tori-amos
newsgroup was a direct outgrowth of rec.music.gaffa.  If you don't like Tori
(I'm not particularly fond of her, either) it would do well for you to not
air your juvenilia on the newsgroup.  The way things stand right now you and
other pseudonymous aol'ers are giving more mature users a bad name.  Grow up.

Take care,

Chris

&gt;Geez, I'm from the states and I know something they don't! Do 
&gt;these people have e-mail addresses?

I suppose the charitable view would be that one of them comes from Welling
too
and that it was an 'in-joke'. I did wonder at the time if it was a facetious
reference to KT

&gt;Guess I should come clean and admit this is my favorite XTC song of all.
&gt;Always loved it without really listening to it or trying to figure out
&gt;what it meant.

&gt;Then had an odd experience of visiting Europe and walking in the footsteps
&gt;of a relative who died in WWII. When I came back I listened again and it
&gt;resonated more for my especially the part about the sermons "still echo
&gt;round these churchyard walls."

Exactly. A luvly wee tune. It has a quite similar wistful feel and theme to
Kate Bush's 'Oh England My Lionheart', another favourite.

No, most people found dead in their life jackets has frozen to death.

&gt;Still looking into how to get a black T-shirt made with the image of
&gt;an astronauts glove held up mostly covering an image of the Earth,
&gt;with the words above/below it saying "Peek-a-boo, little Earth". The
&gt;imagery of that song (to me) is so strong (well so are lots of the
&gt;others too, but that one stuck in my mind). Feel free to do this for
&gt;yourself, remember to put in small extras, like the glove would have
&gt;to have a flag on the cuff - guess which - no not a country flag!

Excellent idea. I would buy one!

Tori DOES have a newsgroup:  rec.music.tori-amos

hmmmmm....funny you should mention this.  Um...I recently
got into a flamefest in the Tori newsgroup because I
 defended Kate.  Basically, a "dickhead" said that The
 Dreaming was, and I quote: "boring to tears".
...can you believe that?, sick!  

So I just had to say that he wasn't ready for the big 
leagues and that The Dreaming is better than ANY crap 
that Tori's ever done.   I'm still smoking right now ;-)

....so I'm standing back on this one...even though i sorta
agree with you. 

I concluded that most Kate fans embrace Tori more than
Tori fans embrace Kate.  (you're not helping my theory here)

peace  (more than ever)

Newsgroups: rec.music.gaffa
Subject: Advice Needed...

Hi all.  Over the past few years I've become a fan of Kate and her
music, and am in the process of making a tape to give to a friend
that would serve as a sampler of some of Kate's work, for the
purpose of giving him an idea of Kate's artistic vision.  Problem
is, I only own Red Shoes, Sensual World, Hounds of Love and the
Whole Story, so my range of material to use in the sampler is
limited.

What I'm looking for are suggestions on what other fans feel are
the best songs to include in the tape.  I'm trying to acheive a
sense of balance between songs that some may consider more
"accessible" such as "Top of the City" and works such as "Sat
In Your Lap" (both of which I love).  Any help would be very
much appreciated.  Thank you in advance.

-John

--- end of quoted material ---
well, my advice would be to put The Whole Story on one
side and split the other side with:
   The Ninth Wave
   The Sensual World (the song, not the whole album)
   The Fog
   This Woman's Work
   Rubberband Girl
   Moments Of Pleasure
   Lily
   The Red Shoes
....i hope your tape's long enough.  :-)

You can also tape all four albums... :-) or better yet, you can
simply buy your friend a copy of The Whole Story.  That way,
Kate will be getting residuals for your efforts.

peace

So, how badly should we flame the clueless twit? Not for not liking Tori
Amos, mind you. Everybody is entitled to their opinion and I certainly
have no problem with him finding Ms. Amos's music unappealing. I am minded
to flame him for being rude, juvenile, intolerant, uncouth and generally
unpleasant to be around. The post was, IMHO, the intellectual equivalent
of spray-painting obscenities on a bathroom wall.  Beavis and Butthead
would be proud ("He said 'sucks.' Heh, heh, heh."). 

Do you think I should flame him?

Just wondering,
Stu

P.S. Of course, the post was such obvious flamebait that it is possible 
that, ahem, KateManiac, (I shudder to use that term in reference to this 
.. person) is deliberately trying to goad someone into a flame war to 
stroke his teeny, tiny little ego. Or, he left his machine logged on and 
someone is playing a trick on him. God, you meet the weirdest people in 
the net (OK, myself included). :-)
