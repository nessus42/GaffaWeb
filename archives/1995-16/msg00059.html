&gt; My first lasting exposure to her was her other performance on that show,
&gt; _The Man With The Child In His Eyes_. I didn't get seriously into Kate for
&gt; years afterward, and I didn't even know who she was at the time, but wow,
&gt; the image of that woman in the gold bodysuit sitting on top of a grand
&gt; piano and singing in the most awesome voice stuck with me from that moment
&gt; on...It sort offaded from my memory over the years so that It wasn't until
&gt; recently that I re-connected that memory with Kate. I didn't know it then,
&gt; but I was destined to be a KateFan. :-)
 

	My first Kateperience was some early eighties video show called
V3 (I think) which is now defunct. They announced a clip of The Dreaming
and said that she'd written, played on and produced the song. I was
intrigued...but, with my early eighties American tastes, did not really
care for the weird seemingly melody-less clip that followed.

	Pat Benatar was my idolstress at the time - YEAH ROCK AND ROLL,
MAN!!! (sorry, flashback.) I'd all but forgotten Kate's video clip when
Ms. Benatar had the good taste to cover Wuthering Heights. "What an ex-
traordinary song!" I thought, and set out to find an album of the 'K.
Bush' who was credited with writing it. Wouldn't you know, the only album
I could find at the time would be the Dreaming!

	I was completely flabbergasted that someone with such a voice and
such obvious talent would put out these ten weird songs! Why? What had she
been thinking? But the more I listened, the more I was hooked. The Dreaming
has since become one of my favorite albums, and I hear something new every-
time I listen to it. I'm a fellow midwestern O-state boy (Oklahoma this
time, not Ohio) who also discovered Kate TWICE whilst in his teens. Quelle
coincidence!
