Hi people,

Being as there are a 'few my first time' stories going around I 
thought I'd share mine.......sounds stoopid but it's actually very 
true.....

The week before Wuthering Heights was released, Radio 1 was promoting 
it, as they do, and the very first time I heard it was in the recovery room of a 
dentist, no really.....having just had several teeth out and being 
somewhat the worse for wear thanks to the influence of the gas, I was 
quite calmed by the sound of this ethereal, angelic sound emanating 
from the  radio.....made all the more ethereal by my stunning lack of 
coherence at the time.......

I assumed it was one of those brilliant songs you hear in your dreams 
and wish you could write down 'cos you  just know it'd make a 
million.......then forget instantly.    Well this one didn't let go 
and a week later  Radio Luxembourg had it as their 'PowerPlay' .
Every Hour on the Hour.....   I was gutted because it wasn't 'my 
song', but thrilled that it really was every bit as good as I remember 
it!    sigh........

This of course sparked a love which has stretched from that moment to 
this......with the exception of 'Babooshka', of course....hehehheheh!

.......and no I DON'T mean that Kate reminds me of a trip to the 
dentist.......although my family would claim otherwise.....  ;-) 

Take Care

Will Yum!
