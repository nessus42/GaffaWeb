Hi Bay Area Love-Hounds, 

The twice-yearly KFJC record swap, at Foothill College off of lovely 
Highway 280 is this Sunday, 21 May, from about 9 till 3.  There is usually 
plenty of stuff that us eclectic types go for.  Also, cassettes, posters, boots, 
video compilations, and other rarities can be had.  I'll be on the lookout
to see if anyone is hawking "The Love-Hounds Collection," and will destroy all 
copies on the spot.  I may need to be bailed out. :-) 

Also, while channel surfing on FM last night, I came across a show on 90.3,
KALW, a kind of alternative/public radio/NPR type of station.  A couple of 
well-known, respected digeridoo players called David Hudson and Steven Kent
were live in studio and their releases were being featured.  I didn't catch
the show from the beginning, unfortunately, but it sure was informative and 
entertaining!  Hudson is also a painter and a dancer, and this weekend, he 
and Kent are performing in the area.  Here's the information I have, in case
any of you would enjoy attending.  I would if I wasn't so damn busy at work! 

Saturday, 8:15 pm, at the Noe Valley Ministry (whatever that is), they will 
perform.  Note that admission to this one is cheap, only around $10 to get 
in. Earlier that day (about 2:30) Hudson will be holding a workshop on 
drawing, digeridoo, and on aboriginal customs and life in general-I didn't 
get a lot of information on this; I'd expect that if anyone is curious, they 
can call KALW for more info.  

David Hudson is also playing the Berkeley Freight and Salvage club soon 
after that, I believe I heard Tuesday night, but I could be wrong.  

ObKate:  Of course, I called the station after the show last night to get 
these professionals' opinions on Kate's use of the dig'..  I talked with 
Hudson, who was happy to talk about Rolf Harris and Kate and _The Dreaming_. 
Needless to say, Hudson was impressed.
