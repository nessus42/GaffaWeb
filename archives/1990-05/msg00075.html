&gt; I love The Wicker Man, and feel it is one of the finest films of the
&gt; '70's-- and as to the music, does anyone know if there was/is a
&gt; soundtrack recording, and if so, how difficult is it to find?  The music
&gt; in the film, if you don't know, features some haunting, beautiful songs,
&gt; and I would love to get a copy, as the boot I made from my video copy
&gt; didn't turn out too well (too much dialogue interspersed).
&gt; 
&gt; thanks in advance---

  Just a couple of notes about about The Wicker Man. The first time I saw
this movie on videotape was with a bunch of Wiccans (white witches). Quite
an interesting perspective on the events in the film, folks discussing the
song that the inn-keepers daughter sang, and how it ranked as a spell.
( The references in the film to Punch are a load of dingo's kidneys,
however. My Father was a Punch and Judy puppeteer and I'm fairly
knowledgeable on this subject. He was a Ronald McDonald too. Swear to god.)
An friend named John became fixated on this film and tried to call Lord
Summerisle. It _is_ a real place. Apparently the people at the bar that he
reached had received other calls and had a little fun at his expense.


&gt;&gt;From: tracyr@uunet.uu.net (june cleaver's dark side)
&gt;&gt;Subject: what would it TaKe for KaTe to lose fans?
&gt;&gt;I agree with the others, who thought a marriage by KaTe would
&gt;&gt;probably have little effect on her number of male fans.
&gt;&gt;Especially since she's been effectively married to Del for some time now.
&gt;&gt;However, let me ask you this:  How many of you would be less
&gt;&gt;taken with Kate's music if she were to gain, say, 30 pounds?
&gt;&gt;As much as I hate to admit it, I suspect
&gt;&gt;much of Kate's appeal for me is her good looks.

   nbc@INF.RL.AC.UK replied
&gt;The fact that Kate is good looking really has no connection with her
&gt;music. I cannot believe there would be many of her fans who would

&gt;There are a number of female singers who are not attractive in the
&gt;conventional sense but still produce great stuff e.g.Alf, Mary Coughlan
                                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Mary Coughlan not attractive??? _Beg_ to differ! We have a live
performance of "Seduced" that, in my book, ranks as one of the more
erotic pieces of music around.
   I guess I must be some sort of pervert as I don't find the scrawny,
anorexic type of woman very, well, womanly. I find a clearly defined
rib-cage, as in the "Babooshka" video, a definite turn-off. Go ahead and
flame me, tell me how sexy Kate's ribs are but I wouldn't mind if Kate
put on some weight. Kate's erotic qualities come from the heart, not the
breasts. She is very attractive, but the exact same physical features on
someone else, without the intelligence, kindness and gently infuriating way
of answering questions in interviews, would not be as attractive. She has
grown _more_ desirable as she has aged, not less. She was asked, after the
Tour of Life, what she would be like at thirty. She replied "...a few more
lines. I hope they're happy ones." I hope so too.

Re: Another quick (mushy Valentine's Day) non-Kate item:

   The first film we saw together was "The Elephant Man". We were both
in tears at the end. We knew we had something that would last forever. 
I love you, Vickie.
