Just a little contribution from a Kate-bashing sourpuss....

_Music Technology_ is the US daughter magazine of _Electronics and Music 
Maker_, a UK publication on electronic synthesis. Every month, MT has a
column entitled Listening Lab, where a half-dozen or so electronic albums
are reviewed, with one chosen as the "Pick of the Month." TSW was the"Pick"
for the Feb. 1990 issue, and the review, by Dan Rue, follows:

KATE BUSH: The Sensual World (Columbia): Pick of the Month

	After four long years since the release of _Hounds of Love_,
die-hard Kate Bush fans can rejoice in yet another startling display
of exceptional creative talent. In many ways, this album is a refinement
of the style that she has been cultivating for years. Her particular
brand of theatrics blended with mutant Irish folk rhythms blended with
far-out spacey arrangements permeates every nook and cranny of _The
Sensual World_ to produce a fantastically affecting brew.
	As with her past recordings, she once again breaks new ground
in soundscapes. The beetle's wing of the brew this time is the inclusion
of the Trio Bulgarka on four of the tracks, most notably on the tragic
'Rocket's Tail.' The bizarre vocal timbre and nuance of these Bulgarian
folk singers lend an unearthly quality to the mood of the album (as if
Kate ever needed help in *that* department!).
	In many ways , _The Sensual World_ is more akin to her first
two albums, _The Kick Inside_ and _Lionheart_. Whereas _Hounds of Love_
placed major emphasis on atmosphere (and she certainly doesn't abandon
this altogether - 'The Fog' is perhaps her most richly crafted tone poem
to date), this album focuses on *songs*.  And like her first two albums,
_The Sensual World_ is remarkably listenable. An excellent example can
be found in 'Love and Anger', with its infectious rhythm, propelled by a
titillating inaction [sic] between the drums and wildly arpeggiating
synths (warning: the video does not do the song justice!).
	I could go on raving about this album for pages, but instead I'll
simply insist that you listen for yourself.
