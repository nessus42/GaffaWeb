&gt;I'm a bit surprised that I haven't seen any mention here of the fact
&gt;that the "Love and Anger" on "TSW - The Videos" is differant from the
&gt;video shown by MTV and VH1.  The most noticable difference is that
&gt;they cut out the little fit that Kate has when the ballet dancers take 
&gt;the orb and scepter from her.  There are some other changes in the edit
&gt;but I can't name them off hand.  Could this be an edit intended for the 
&gt;U.K.?

Yeah, I thought I noticed this too but I wasn't entirely sure since my
original copy of Love and Anger was less than crystal clear.  I can't
for the life of me imagine why the UK would have to have the epileptic
thrashings edited down to a minimum, but this is why I am not a record
company executive.

&gt;&gt; "The Sensual World" was *HOT*.  Mmmmmmmh, YES!!!!!!!!  God, how I wanted
&gt;&gt; her!  Especially during the instrumental break when she was stepping
&gt;&gt; through the night turning toward the camera and away - Mmmmmhhh, yes!
&gt;&gt; Definitely her most erotic video yet.

Sorry, Larry, it has to be Running Up That Hill.  The drawing back of
the imaginary bowstring with that pout... No, I'm afraid TSW is
definitely a poor second.

&gt;&gt; "This Woman's Work" was *amazing*.  Very nicely done.  I just wish she
&gt;&gt; hadn't bothered to frame it with the piano bit.  I mean, I think we could
&gt;&gt; all get the fact that she was singing from his point of view without it,

Yeah, but then we wouldn't have that neato shot of Kate with her hair
all pinned up sitting there in a TUX!  I personally don't think I've
ever seen her in a tuxedo before, but she looks great...

&gt;The only part of the TWW video that bothers me is when he's wrestling 
&gt;with the steering wheel.  Don't they have power steering in the U.K.? :-)
&gt;I won't get to watch this one too often, it makes mm...um my wife cry,
&gt;yeah, my wife. &lt;sniff&gt;

As for the steering wheel: it's drama, cut them a little slack.  And
yeah, it is a terribly affecting video.  Gives me them old familiar
Kate chills down my spine that I thought I would never feel again.

&gt;&gt; All-in-All, I still think "Hounds of Love" is her best video, or "Running
&gt;&gt; Up That Hill".  But, MMMMMMH, yes!  "The Sensual World" will titillate me
&gt;&gt; for years to come.
&gt;
&gt;I'd have to say that "Cloudbusting" is the best video of all time.

Well, I agree with larry.  Definitely "Hounds of Love."  I like videos
that are frenetic and full of images.  Besides, it has a bunch of
overt Hitchcock references!  (Including the Hitch look-alike passing
in front of the camera!)

&gt;I'm a bit surprised that they picked Love and Anger as the next U.K.
&gt;single.  "Never Be Mine" would have been a better choice.  Besides,
&gt;that would mean another video!

That may be precisely why they *didn't* pick it.  But who cares - the
CD single will have THREE extra unreleased tracks!!!  Yowza! (I hope
they're better than "I'm Still Waiting."  Please, Dear Kate, all I ask
is to feel that awesome thrill one more time...)
