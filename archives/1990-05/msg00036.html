I agree with the others, who thought a marriage by KaTe would
probably have little effect on her number of male fans.
Especially since she's been effectively married to Del for some
time now.

However, let me ask you this:  How many of you would be less
taken with Kate's music if she were to gain, say, 30 pounds?  I
ask because I've seen a complaint or two on this newsgroup
about her "puffy" look during certain interviews.

Also, at KaTemas last summer, Andy warned us that in an
interview that was coming up on his tape, KaTe was at her top
weight.  While Andy was rather sensitive and gentle (ofcourse),
it was a warning nevertheless.  And even I was relieved when he
reported that more recent photos of her indicated she was back
to her petite self.  As much as I hate to admit it, I suspect 
much of Kate's appeal for me is her good looks.
