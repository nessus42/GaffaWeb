Chris here,
    Just a few thoughts about the "Sensual" videos. We don't yet have
the compilation. (Every thing takes a long time to reach the mid-west - 
they must ship this stuff via ocean-going vessels)
 I was thinking about why all three ("This Woman's Work" from the VH-1
special included) are in letter-box. As near as I can tell they are in
academy aspect ratio.
  Generally music videos are shot on film and edited on video, but these
three seem to have been edited on film as well. A couple of reasons for
working this way occured to me. Maybe because film editing takes longer?:-)
But another, more hopeful, reason could be that editing on film leaves open
the possiblity of a future high definition release. Well shot film is better
quality than any of the proposed high-def. systems and when high-def.
equipment becomes available there will be a need for program material.
  We would have _loved_ to have seen the _film_ release of "Experiment IV"
that played as a trailer in England. Wasn't "Cloudbusting" released to 
theatres as well? 
  We have found a source for the Japanese "Single File" video. The price 
we paid was $69.95. Before you start gasping and clutching your wallet or purse, this is, in fact, a _good_ price. The first copy we owned was
purchased by my Mom in Tokyo when it first came out and cost us $89.95.
     
          Here is a track listing:
          
             Wuthering Heights
             The Man with the Child in His Eyes
             Hammer Horror
           * Wow (the original version)
           * Them Heavy People
             Breathing
             Babooshka
             Army Dreamers
             Sat in Your Lap
             The Dreaming
           * Suspended in Gaffa
           * There Goes a Tenner
                                 * Unavailable elsewhere

If you are interested call:
                             The Record Cabinet
                             (816) 432-8783
                             talk to James (nice guy with good Japanese
                                             and Finnish connections)


                             Chris of,
                                Chris'n'Vickie
                                  of Kansas City
