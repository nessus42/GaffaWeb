Vickie here,   

          **********  NEAT NEWS ***********

You UK Lovehounds need to get your VCRs ready!!!

I just talked to Peter David Fitzgerald-Morris (professor of
Kate Bushology and Homeground fellow) and he told me that Kate
wrote a song for an episode of The Comic Strip.
It's the title theme for an episode named "G.L.C" (I don't know
if that's the song title as well) and he thinks she may have 
written more incidental music for the episode as well, though he's
not sure about that. This song will be on the b-side of L&amp;A when
it's released in England in March. The episode is supposed to air
this week or next. Check your TV Times. According to Peter, GLC
is "a film starring Charles Bronson (but actually Robbie Coltrane)
as fearless Ken Livingston out to save London from the evil Ice Maiden
(alias Margaret Thatcher)."  Ok, so it's a bit obscure to non-British.


Also very, very neat: in a few weeks Kate herself will appear in an
episode of The Comic Strip called "Les Dogs." Peter described it
as a "Fellini-esque film about a self-obsessed man who had a car crash,
wandered into a wedding reception and falls in love with the bride. As
far as we understand, Kate is actually the bride" 

                !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So Neil &amp; all you other British lovehounds, be sure to tell us how it
all goes.
