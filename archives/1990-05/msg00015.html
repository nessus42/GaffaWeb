 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: Kate married: Kate-echism XXX.2.vii

   Nick Kings asks: Will Kate lose her predominantly male following if she
gets married? First, she _is_, in effect, married, in that she has been
involved--probably monogamously--with Del Palmer for about fifteen years
now (not just ten, as :&gt;oug reported--they met when the KT Bush Band was
being formed in preparation for Kate's tour of pubs in Kent in 1975, and
Del at least has confessed that he was smitten immediately).
   Second, Kate actually has a pretty large proportion of female fans. There
are quite a few women visible in the shots of the audience in the Hammer-
smith film, and female membership in the KBC seems always to have been
relatively high. Also, if one considers the _influence_ of individual
Kate Bush fans on the dissemination of information about Kate to the
fan community at large, one will see that women are very well
represented: Lisa Bradley edits the KBC _Newsletter_; Krystyna
FitzGerald co-edits _Homeground_, and Sharon May is its secretary;
Gillian Gaar edited _For_the_Love_of_Kate_; Robyn Somerville is
sole editor of _Still_Breathing_; Jackie Bain was editor of the
Scottish fanzine _Blow_Away_; Tina d'Agostino runs the Italian
fanzine _First_and_Last_For_Ever_; and Gaye Godfrey is more or less
the main editor of the Australian fanzine _Dreamtime_. In addition
the two most prolific and/or (arguably) most nearly professional artists
contributing to fanzines these days are both women--Debi Bowes and
Jody Leak.
     But to answer your question: _If_ Kate were to marry someone--Del
or anyone else--and _if_, as a consequence, her fans were to
diminish in number, IED for one would view both events as being
equally blessed. To anyone foolish enough to have been drawn to Kate
Bush's art by asinine considerations of her "availability", IED
sends out a hearty "Good riddance!"
