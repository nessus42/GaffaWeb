&gt;Is my news feed botched or are people just not interested

Not interested in KaTe?!?!?!?  Just because I lurk doesn't mean I'm

&gt;From: mba01@aol.com (Mba01)

&gt;I have to agree: 
&gt;I dislike Fruitopia ads, especially since these fruit-based beverages are
&gt;mostly corn syrup and water.  However, the previous writer is correct when
&gt;saying that the ads were not targeted to we who dislike the ads.

&gt;For the record, 
&gt;Fruitopia was introduced by Coke in March 1994.  It was an attempt to
&gt;enter the "alternative non-carbonated beverages" market, a market that
&gt;accounts for $2 billion in sales, and is growing by 15% each year. 
&gt;Fruitopia is reported to have had 60% of Snapple's sales in January 95, up
&gt;from 43% of Snapple's sales volume in November 94 (although, I don't think
&gt;this is total sales, but sales in the convenience store channel). 
&gt;Fruitopia's sales were about $20 million for the first quarter 1995.  Ad
&gt;spending for the year is about $30 million

&gt;The whole new-age, 60's psychedelic feel to the ads by Chiat-Day (now part
&gt;of Ominicom) and Kate Bush were probably based on Coke's research that
&gt;said that the target consumer was seeking not only refreshment for their
&gt;body, but refreshment for their mind and spirit as well (corn syrup and
&gt;flavorings?).  Although the new-age-ness of the ads has been toned down,
&gt;Coke Foods must be happy with the 60's theme, since their new
&gt;lower-calorie line of beverages will be branded as "Inner Light."

Hi there,

I've been in my own little conversation with someone (about MIDI
downloading etc), and just to let others know, I did some close
approximations (OK no singing so I used a Calliope, the other
instrumentation IS very close). You can get them from multiple places:
	www	<A  HREF="http://actor.cs.vt.edu/~wentz">http://actor.cs.vt.edu/~wentz</A>
	ftp	ftp.cs.ruu.nl:/pub/MIDI/SONGS/POP
			armydrea.zip
			babushka.zip
			cldbstng.zip
		and associated .doc files too.
I can (if you want) email them, but I'll use uuencode (or btoa if you ask),
so check you have a uudecode program of some form first, sorry email
does not handle binary. I did post them a while back in the newsgroup
	alt.binary.sounds.midi
so if you were downloading from there, you will have seen them earlier
this year.

Anyway, the other person I was talking (well, emailling) with, asked me:

&gt; Will there be new files in the future at that site?  I don't think the song
&gt; from the Fruitopia commercial I wanted was there...it's the one where the
&gt; music has the beat like a heartbeat...do you know which one I'm talking
&gt; about?  Also this guy mentioned she had some albums out called "Never For
&gt; Ever" and "Hounds of Love", which of those albums contains the Fruitopia
&gt; music, if either?

My answers are:

Yes, I'm working on Wuthering Heights, but the summer weather tempts me
outside more than sitting in front of a computer screen. I'll do more
tracks as winter keeps me in more.

The Fruitopia commercial I do not believe is on any KaTe album.
I wonder if anyone knows the background into the Fruitopia deal?

Her main albums have been:
	The Kick Inside		(Feb 78)
	Lionheart		(Nov 78)
	Never For Ever		(Sep 80)
	The Dreaming		(Sep 82)
	Hound Of Love		(Sep 85)
	The Sensual World	(Oct 89)
	The Red Shoes		(Nov 93)
There have been various singles, boxed sets, videos, interviews, bootlegs,
etc, but if you collect the above albums, you'll have all but a few of
her songs.

Interestingly, if you plot of album number vs days since her first
album, shows that up until the last album she took near enough one year
longer to release each album (exception of the Dreaming, which took just
2 months longer than Never For Ever). Then a change, The Red Shoes took
virtually the same time to do as The Sensual World, so extrapolating
this fact she has levelled out to a time to release a new album (ie
once every 4 years), the next one should be out Nov-97. Luckily, the
previous analysis of when The Red Shoes would be released (which was
Nov 94, just count the years between each, they go: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4),
this would have meant that the next album would have been Nov 2000. But
again I say LUCKILY things have leveled off to just 4 years per album.
This is IF mathematical analysis can be done on the time taken to
produce an album. Maybe she'll surprise the calculation again and
release a year earlier again, ie Nov-1996 - yes!

Kenny Jow asks whether there are any plans for
an official release of Kate Bush's music for
the Fruitopia account.  As far as any of us knows,
the answer is no -- at least, Peter FitzGerald-Morris,
our premier Kate Bushologist, says nothing about it
in the latest Homeground (No. 55, a typically invaluable
piece of work from the Homegrounders -- congrats, Peter!).

As for the availability of Kate Bush's music in Midi
format, the answer is yes.  Someone posted about making
some of Kate's songs available via the Web, IED believes.
With a good notation application all the extant Kate Bush
sheet-music could be easily transcribed to Midi and put
on the Web.

   P.S.: IED recommends that everyone who can should get
to a Katemas party this year!!

Hmmm... I seem to be all alone on this one... (well, except for this
person I met at a Katemas do some years ago in Manchester).

Everybody appears to be, at best, an ex-Rush fan, having been
converted to Katonians. Surely I can't be all alone in enjoying both?

They may sound nothing alike but Kate and Rush have both produced
tracks filled with vivid imagary and stories. My favourite albums from
each are HoL and Hemispheres for the same reasons; both are excellent
albums put together with skill and posses a practically 'cinematic'
quality that you can lose yourself in.

One just happens to have more power chords in it's arrangement than
the other :-)

Now there's an interesting thought. She got the goods from a book
about Wilhelm Reich but he may have come up with the name for his
ranch 'Organon' as you describe.

Upon close inspection [if you can inspect sound] the jury returns a

She does in fact sing,
 "sugar... honey... sugar....WHAYEE-EE-EEAHAGH.... sugar.... sugar".

I can see how the fourth *word* could be construed to mean 'treacle'

&gt; Listen again. Any idea? Or solved long ago?

Oh hello, Heidi Stewart here.
                      ^

I'm not actually able to e-mail anyone  coz I don't have access to an
account and I'm not keen with a computer really. A friend of mine
who does have access, told me about my letter being mailed to the
group, and seeing as though I'm staying at his house at the moment I
thought I'd take advantage of this privelage(?).  I thought I'd
better add, that this letter was written a long time ago and it was
just a little thing I noticed one day. I didn't expect it to get
printed, I suppose I was trying to be a bit of a clever cloggs.
Do things like this have to be taken so seriously?  Okay, it's a
saaad song, I thought that little cheeky twist at the end lifted it a
bit, made it a bit more fly-away, y'know (sorry, just stirring!!).
I'll tell you where I think it is. It's after the last, "sugar?" but
quite a way after it, nearer the end.  It's sung a lot lower than the
 "sugar?...honey?...sugar?" bit...get those headphones on and
listen a little harder.  I'm really sorry for wasting the time of
all those millions who aren't really interested (I thought I'd better
say that coz Garrick said I'll get flamed), it's Oh so trivial and so
much so that I'm saying nothing more about it.  ( by the way, I'm only
17 and so can get away with being so blummin' daft, that's _my_
excuse).  TA.
