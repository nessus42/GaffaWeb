Him: Gee, Valerie, what can we do to create the best Katemas celebration 
     east of the Mississippi?

Her: Well, Chip, I don't know. Short of travelling to Germany to visit 
     other ectophiles/love hounds, what could we do?

Him: Erm, well, I'm doing that actually.

Her: (seething) Not all of us can travel 1000s of miles on a whim. We'll 
     have to think of something else.

{both think intensely. Bits of steam escape from Valerie's ears. Flames leap
out of Chip's eyes}

Her: I know! We can host our own Katemas celebration, right here in 
     Chicago! 

Him: Yeah! On July 16th, so I can take the pictures to Germany with me.

Her: (turning her back to Chip) Harumph!

{minutes of silence while Valerie gets over her jealousy and Chip silently 
tallies the number of hours Valerie slave work at her job while Chip is 
enjoying summertime in Europe}

Her: We'd better get around to inviting everyone on ecto and gaffa.

Him: I already took the liberty of doing that.

Her: Smart ass. Tell people to email you at chip-l@nwu.edu for details.

Him: Or you at vnozick@tribune.com.

Her: Sounds good. Now let's be good ectophiles and go to that Barry Manilow 
concert.


Just kidding! Here's a different, more serious idea:

Deck the halls, it's that time of the year again!

Katemas is near, and it's time to PARTY! 

Rock in the new Kate year with a Chicago Katemas gathering, courtesy of 
Chip and Valerie (the other C&amp;V). Music, videos, friendly company, two 
really cute cats, Tim Cook from England... What more could you want? It's 
coming up soon -- July 16, since Chip is flying to Germany over the real 
Katemas weekend.

Chip's place is located near public transportation, so it's easy to get to. 
And crash space is available for the whole weekend. Drop Chip a line at 
chip-l@nwu.edu, or Valerie at vnozick@tribune.com, if you're coming.

&gt;Seems to be the case. Not only is there the batkate backcover, but last

&gt;The movies were:
&gt;1) Nosferatu                 (very recognizable tune)
&gt;2) The Return of Count Yorga (less recognizable tune)
&gt;Anyone know other Kate-Dracula connections?
   Well, I read somewhere that Kate was once offered a leading part in a vampire-film. Anyone have
anymore details on that?

   And staying with horror-films for a moment. When you look closely in one of the Elm Street films (I forgot
which one exactly, but my guess is the third) you'll spot a "Lionheart" poster on a bedroom wall...

  BTW, Chris, it's great to see another Kate-fan from Belgium on the list :-)

  And as far as "Turkish Delight" goes... I actually went for quite a long time believing it *was* Kate. So 
thanks you guys, for clearing up this little matter :)

I would recommend "Babylon 5" for anyone who LOVES bad acting, the
moldiest of scripts, and special effects straight out of "Battlestar
Galactica".  OK, it's not NEARLY as painful to watch as "VR 5", but
it's right up there.  Me, I'd rather watch reruns of "Cop Rock".

Mailbombing a jerk who sends innappropriate ads is a VERY bad idea,
because one of the two will happen:

1) It hurts the innocent OTHER users on the system (not to mention
   the probably-innocent sysadmin) OR
2) The account will probably be pulled by the time you read the
   message anyway, so the sender will never see your bomb, anyway.

WHAT TO DO ABOUT THESE JERKS:

Copy the letter and send the complete letter WITH HEADER to
postmaster@ and wherever the letter was sent from.  For example,
if canter@foo.bar.com sends chain letter to MAKE MONEY FAST, copy
it and send it to postmaster@bar.com (The "foo" is just the name
of the user's node, so ignore it).  You can be rest assured the
jerk will never spam again...

Hi!

Emma Bull's _The War For The Oaks_ has a scene in it wherein one of the
protagonists comes home in a snit and puts on _HoL_ to cheer herself up.
And Terry Pratchett's _Pyramids_ (I think -- it's one of the Discworld novels)
has a footnote which mentions Kate (not to mention the harem girl getting
abducted on the cover looks ***exactly*** like Kate in a modified Babooshka
outfit).

If I were a fiction writer I'd mention Kate, but I don't think that counts. :)

 &gt; 2) The Return of Count Yorga (less recognizable tune)

What is this less recognizable tune, and where can it
be found in Kate's work?

 &gt; Anyone know other Kate-Dracula connections?

As a matter of fact, yes. An early song (found among
the "Cathy Demos"), called "Carmilla" (note spelling), 
is based on Sheridan LeFanu's novella about a vampire.

On Saturday, July 29th I'll be hosting a musical gathering in Portland, 
OR. This is to celebrate Katemas and mjm (from Ecto) and his wife being 
in town for the weekend. It will probably be in the evening. Music will 
be of the Kate/Sarah/Loreena/Tori/Happy/etc./etc./etc. type. If you're

Hi Katefans,

So it looks like I wasnt the only one to hear similarities with
"All we ever look for" and the X-files theme..(thanks Thomas, Cary...)

Actually I like Cary's suggestion of the whistling from "The Dreaming"
sounding like it as well, maybe without the baaaa's however.

As for Will Yum, I really meant the whistling type sound that trails
off right at the end.  I would suggest "Ner, ner, ner, ner, nuh, NAAAAH"
is more appropriate for "The Jig of Life".

&gt;Also this may be very naive, but if I wanted to see if my independent CD
&gt;supplier could get "This woman's work extended 1,2 &amp; 3", where should
&gt;I ask him to look, references etc? Or does anyone know who would be the

"Local to the UK" isn't very specific, but I usually find that record and 
CD fairs ar ethe best places to try.  There's a particularly good one 
that does the rounds in the Thames Valley area.

&gt; That way they will (hopefully) learn to stay away.
&gt; 
&gt; The only problem is: where to draw the line between an OK post and
&gt; those to nuke.

Unfortunately, there are other problems as well.

The ads fall into four classes:

(1) Ads from purely temporary accounts.  The poster has accepted a
trial account with AOL, CompuServe, Delphi, or whomever, and is
=only= going to use it to post ads during the trial period, and then
bail.  The poster isn't going to even be around to read the email.
And these carriers are =not= going to go to the expense of tracking
down and suing the poster.

(2) Ads from more persistent accounts, with normal header info.
Here, the best thing to do is to forward a copy of the ad to
postmaster or root at the host-site.  The administrator will either
strip the user of access to the computer, or warn the user that any
repetition will cause such loss.  In the latter case, some sort of
nuking would perhaps reinforce the point.

(3) Ads from persistent accounts, with partially censored headers.
In this case, your mail handler may report that there is a missing
user-id and/or a missing host-site.  However, if you =save= the
message as a file, and then look at the full header with a text
editor, you can sometimes find (1) the site-name, and (2), a message
id.  In this case, do =not= send the message to postmaster with the
=forward= command of your mail handler, because important info may
be stripped out of the header by your handler.  =Instead=, start a
=new= message to postmaster, and then read the saved message into
the body of your message.  The administrator can use the message-id
to identify the culprit.  The administrator will strip the user of
the account.

(4) Ads with thoroughly censored headers.  Through a combination of
lax security at some sites, and a bit of expertise on the part of
the user, it is sometimes possible to make it impracticable to track
a message.  Unless someone here is a really good counter-hacker, we
