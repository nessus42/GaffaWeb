Sorry to bother all you Love-Hounds but:

Glen Ford, I tried to mail you directly, but the mail bounced.

You wrote to rec.music.gaffa:

&gt;What gives? I have not seen any new articles in 2 days. 
&gt;
&gt;Is my news feed botched or are people just not interested 
&gt;in KB?
&gt;

All articles came to me by Love-Hounds mailinglist.
If you want, I could mail it to you. Just write a line
telling me what date(and hour) was the last you got, and 
for how many days forward you'd like to have, and I'll 
forward a copy of them to you.

In response to Heidi (?) who wondered wheather or not Kate sang
'treacle' at the end of 'YTO', after 'honey, sugar,honey'...the answer
is yes.  I played the song a few times to verify it, and IMHO, yes Kate
does sing 'treacle'.

Thank you to whomever posted to tour dates for The Innocense Mission.  I
only wish that they would come up to Toronto.

Bye for now,

Del Allan

Since posting my original note about the relevance of the Innocence 
MIssion tour dates, I have been informed (thanks, woj and Jeffrey) that 
TIM has been discussed in this group for quite some time.

To which I stand corrected, but I don't think it would have killed the 
original posters to have maybe told a bit about the band rather than just 
plopping the dates in without any explanation. Not everyone here has been 
here for a long time....and, without any accompanying information, the 
list of dates looks like it could be part of a Spam-O-Rama to totally 
irrelevant groups.

Cheers, Fiona

THis isn't exactly true. Liz did the vocals on two songs on TMC's first
album, "It'll End In Tears." They're painfully beautiful tracks (Tim
Buckley's "song to the siren" and Roy Harper's "Another Day," a song I
think most of us here have heard of!), far outshining anything else TMC
did on their other two albums. TMC are not a band, per se, but a
collection of artists who recorded on 4AD doing covers of obscure songs,
which often went awry, IMO.
I do however, recommend the first album very, very much.

I suspect dates for the Innocence Mission would only be of interest to

I'm getting ready to move and while doing so a fellow Kate fan freaked out
when he saw the poster which, until then, was never out of the original
plastic. I found it at a going out of business sale for a record store and
though I'd frame it for my new room.

It's of Kate in a workout liatard. Well, he was simply dumbfounded and
stated how it was super hard to get, etc., etc., drolling, etc., etc., she
should do a workout video, etc., etc., breath in, breath out, etc., etc..
;)

Anyway, was just wondering if I shouldn't REALLY take extra care when
getting this poster framed.

It's really hard to say. I've got several Kate 
posters,
most of which I found out were quite difficult to
obtain.
  But it's all in the thought. If you believe that
Kate is a genius, then what the poster may be worth
to someone else (as far as monetary gain goes) is
meaningless; it's valuable to you.
  Me? I don't even want to know what the posters, 
CDs,
and images that I've collected (and posted at:
<A  HREF="http://www.acy.digex.net/~dobenson/benson.html">http://www.acy.digex.net/~dobenson/benson.html</A>)
are worth. All that matters is spreading the word
of genius.
  And that's what Kate is. And why we're all here at
gaffa. Not to make money, but to understand, spread
the word, and enjoy the music/lyrics/madness that
that we're lucky enough to be alive to hear.

I found this in alt.tv.commercials (No, I don't ordinarily
read that group, but you don't want to know how I found it).

&gt;I have to agree: 
&gt;I dislike Fruitopia ads, especially since these fruit-based beverages are
&gt;mostly corn syrup and water.  However, the previous writer is correct when
&gt;saying that the ads were not targeted to we who dislike the ads.

&gt;For the record, 
&gt;Fruitopia was introduced by Coke in March 1994.  It was an attempt to
&gt;enter the "alternative non-carbonated beverages" market, a market that
&gt;accounts for $2 billion in sales, and is growing by 15% each year. 
&gt;Fruitopia is reported to have had 60% of Snapple's sales in January 95, up
&gt;from 43% of Snapple's sales volume in November 94 (although, I don't think
&gt;this is total sales, but sales in the convenience store channel). 
&gt;Fruitopia's sales were about $20 million for the first quarter 1995.  Ad
&gt;spending for the year is about $30 million

&gt;The whole new-age, 60's psychedelic feel to the ads by Chiat-Day (now part
&gt;of Ominicom) and Kate Bush were probably based on Coke's research that
&gt;said that the target consumer was seeking not only refreshment for their
&gt;body, but refreshment for their mind and spirit as well (corn syrup and
&gt;flavorings?).  Although the new-age-ness of the ads has been toned down,
&gt;Coke Foods must be happy with the 60's theme, since their new
&gt;lower-calorie line of beverages will be branded as "Inner Light."

Hi there,

I've been in my own little conversation with someone (about MIDI
downloading etc), and just to let others know, I did some close
approximations (OK no singing so I used a Calliope, the other
instrumentation IS very close). You can get them from multiple places:
	www	<A  HREF="http://actor.cs.vt.edu/~wentz">http://actor.cs.vt.edu/~wentz</A>
	ftp	ftp.cs.ruu.nl:/pub/MIDI/SONGS/POP
			armydrea.zip
			babushka.zip
			cldbstng.zip
		and associated .doc files too.
I can (if you want) email them, but I'll use uuencode (or btoa if you ask),
so check you have a uudecode program of some form first, sorry email
does not handle binary. I did post them a while back in the newsgroup
	alt.binary.sounds.midi
so if you were downloading from there, you will have seen them earlier
this year.

Anyway, the other person I was talking (well, emailling) with, asked me:

&gt; Will there be new files in the future at that site?  I don't think the song
&gt; from the Fruitopia commercial I wanted was there...it's the one where the
&gt; music has the beat like a heartbeat...do you know which one I'm talking
&gt; about?  Also this guy mentioned she had some albums out called "Never For
&gt; Ever" and "Hounds of Love", which of those albums contains the Fruitopia
&gt; music, if either?

My answers are:

Yes, I'm working on Wuthering Heights, but the summer weather tempts me
outside more than sitting in front of a computer screen. I'll do more
tracks as winter keeps me in more.

The Fruitopia commercial I do not believe is on any KaTe album.
I wonder if anyone knows the background into the Fruitopia deal?

Her main albums have been:
	The Kick Inside		(Feb 78)
	Lionheart		(Nov 78)
	Never For Ever		(Sep 80)
	The Dreaming		(Sep 82)
	Hound Of Love		(Sep 85)
	The Sensual World	(Oct 89)
	The Red Shoes		(Nov 93)
There have been various singles, boxed sets, videos, interviews, bootlegs,
etc, but if you collect the above albums, you'll have all but a few of
her songs.

Interestingly, if you plot of album number vs days since her first
album, shows that up until the last album she took near enough one year
longer to release each album (exception of the Dreaming, which took just
2 months longer than Never For Ever). Then a change, The Red Shoes took
virtually the same time to do as The Sensual World, so extrapolating
this fact she has levelled out to a time to release a new album (ie
once every 4 years), the next one should be out Nov-97. Luckily, the
previous analysis of when The Red Shoes would be released (which was
Nov 94, just count the years between each, they go: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4),
this would have meant that the next album would have been Nov 2000. But
again I say LUCKILY things have leveled off to just 4 years per album.
This is IF mathematical analysis can be done on the time taken to
produce an album. Maybe she'll surprise the calculation again and
release a year earlier again, ie Nov-1996 - yes!

Kenny Jow asks whether there are any plans for
an official release of Kate Bush's music for
the Fruitopia account.  As far as any of us knows,
the answer is no -- at least, Peter FitzGerald-Morris,
our premier Kate Bushologist, says nothing about it
in the latest Homeground (No. 55, a typically invaluable
piece of work from the Homegrounders -- congrats, Peter!).

As for the availability of Kate Bush's music in Midi
format, the answer is yes.  Someone posted about making
some of Kate's songs available via the Web, IED believes.
With a good notation application all the extant Kate Bush
sheet-music could be easily transcribed to Midi and put
on the Web.

   P.S.: IED recommends that everyone who can should get
to a Katemas party this year!!

Hmmm... I seem to be all alone on this one... (well, except for this
person I met at a Katemas do some years ago in Manchester).

Everybody appears to be, at best, an ex-Rush fan, having been
converted to Katonians. Surely I can't be all alone in enjoying both?

They may sound nothing alike but Kate and Rush have both produced
tracks filled with vivid imagary and stories. My favourite albums from
each are HoL and Hemispheres for the same reasons; both are excellent
albums put together with skill and posses a practically 'cinematic'
quality that you can lose yourself in.

One just happens to have more power chords in it's arrangement than
the other :-)

Now there's an interesting thought. She got the goods from a book

Upon close inspection [if you can inspect sound] the jury returns a

She does in fact sing,
 "sugar... honey... sugar....WHAYEE-EE-EEAHAGH.... sugar.... sugar".

I can see how the fourth *word* could be construed to mean 'treacle'

Oh hello, Heidi Stewart here.
                      ^

I'm not actually able to e-mail anyone  coz I don't have access to an
account and I'm not keen with a computer really. A friend of mine
who does have access, told me about my letter being mailed to the
group, and seeing as though I'm staying at his house at the moment I
thought I'd take advantage of this privelage(?).  I thought I'd
better add, that this letter was written a long time ago and it was
just a little thing I noticed one day. I didn't expect it to get
printed, I suppose I was trying to be a bit of a clever cloggs.
Do things like this have to be taken so seriously?  Okay, it's a
saaad song, I thought that little cheeky twist at the end lifted it a
bit, made it a bit more fly-away, y'know (sorry, just stirring!!).
I'll tell you where I think it is. It's after the last, "sugar?" but
quite a way after it, nearer the end.  It's sung a lot lower than the
 "sugar?...honey?...sugar?" bit...get those headphones on and
listen a little harder.  I'm really sorry for wasting the time of
all those millions who aren't really interested (I thought I'd better
say that coz Garrick said I'll get flamed), it's Oh so trivial and so
much so that I'm saying nothing more about it.  ( by the way, I'm only
17 and so can get away with being so blummin' daft, that's _my_
excuse).  TA.

really cute cats, Tim Cook from England... What more could you want? It's 
coming up soon -- July 16, since Chip is flying to Germany over the real 
Katemas weekend.

Chip's place is located near public transportation, so it's easy to get to. 
And crash space is available for the whole weekend. Drop Chip a line at

&gt;Seems to be the case. Not only is there the batkate backcover, but last
&gt;weekend there were 2 dracula movies on tv and they both contained a

&gt;The movies were:
&gt;1) Nosferatu                 (very recognizable tune)
&gt;2) The Return of Count Yorga (less recognizable tune)
&gt;Anyone know other Kate-Dracula connections?
   Well, I read somewhere that Kate was once offered a leading part in a vampire-film. Anyone have
anymore details on that?

   And staying with horror-films for a moment. When you look closely in one of the Elm Street films (I forgot
which one exactly, but my guess is the third) you'll spot a "Lionheart" poster on a bedroom wall...

  BTW, Chris, it's great to see another Kate-fan from Belgium on the list :-)

  And as far as "Turkish Delight" goes... I actually went for quite a long time believing it *was* Kate. So 
thanks you guys, for clearing up this little matter :)

           bye for now :)

it's right up there.  Me, I'd rather watch reruns of "Cop Rock".

Mailbombing a jerk who sends innappropriate ads is a VERY bad idea,
because one of the two will happen:

1) It hurts the innocent OTHER users on the system (not to mention
   the probably-innocent sysadmin) OR
2) The account will probably be pulled by the time you read the
   message anyway, so the sender will never see your bomb, anyway.

WHAT TO DO ABOUT THESE JERKS:

Copy the letter and send the complete letter WITH HEADER to
postmaster@ and wherever the letter was sent from.  For example,
if canter@foo.bar.com sends chain letter to MAKE MONEY FAST, copy
it and send it to postmaster@bar.com (The "foo" is just the name
of the user's node, so ignore it).  You can be rest assured the
jerk will never spam again...

Hi!

Emma Bull's _The War For The Oaks_ has a scene in it wherein one of the
protagonists comes home in a snit and puts on _HoL_ to cheer herself up.
And Terry Pratchett's _Pyramids_ (I think -- it's one of the Discworld novels)
has a footnote which mentions Kate (not to mention the harem girl getting
abducted on the cover looks ***exactly*** like Kate in a modified Babooshka
outfit).

If I were a fiction writer I'd mention Kate, but I don't think that counts. :)

What is this less recognizable tune, and where can it
be found in Kate's work?

 &gt; Anyone know other Kate-Dracula connections?

As a matter of fact, yes. An early song (found among
the "Cathy Demos"), called "Carmilla" (note spelling), 
is based on Sheridan LeFanu's novella about a vampire.

Hi Katefans,

So it looks like I wasnt the only one to hear similarities with
"All we ever look for" and the X-files theme..(thanks Thomas, Cary...)

Actually I like Cary's suggestion of the whistling from "The Dreaming"
sounding like it as well, maybe without the baaaa's however.

As for Will Yum, I really meant the whistling type sound that trails
off right at the end.  I would suggest "Ner, ner, ner, ner, nuh, NAAAAH"
is more appropriate for "The Jig of Life".

"Local to the UK" isn't very specific, but I usually find that record and

&gt; That way they will (hopefully) learn to stay away.
&gt; 
&gt; The only problem is: where to draw the line between an OK post and
&gt; those to nuke.

Unfortunately, there are other problems as well.

The ads fall into four classes:

(1) Ads from purely temporary accounts.  The poster has accepted a
trial account with AOL, CompuServe, Delphi, or whomever, and is
=only= going to use it to post ads during the trial period, and then
bail.  The poster isn't going to even be around to read the email.
And these carriers are =not= going to go to the expense of tracking
down and suing the poster.

(2) Ads from more persistent accounts, with normal header info.
Here, the best thing to do is to forward a copy of the ad to
postmaster or root at the host-site.  The administrator will either
strip the user of access to the computer, or warn the user that any
repetition will cause such loss.  In the latter case, some sort of
nuking would perhaps reinforce the point.

(3) Ads from persistent accounts, with partially censored headers.
In this case, your mail handler may report that there is a missing
user-id and/or a missing host-site.  However, if you =save= the
message as a file, and then look at the full header with a text
editor, you can sometimes find (1) the site-name, and (2), a message
id.  In this case, do =not= send the message to postmaster with the
=forward= command of your mail handler, because important info may
be stripped out of the header by your handler.  =Instead=, start a
=new= message to postmaster, and then read the saved message into
the body of your message.  The administrator can use the message-id
to identify the culprit.  The administrator will strip the user of
the account.

(4) Ads with thoroughly censored headers.  Through a combination of
lax security at some sites, and a bit of expertise on the part of
the user, it is sometimes possible to make it impracticable to track
a message.  Unless someone here is a really good counter-hacker, we
can't do anything about such postings.

          It's always Dark.  Light only hides the Darkness.

Kate has said (don't remember where I read this) that the Ashes to Ashes
video was a direct influence on the Breathing video.  Bowie's came first.
The two clips did not have the same director.
	Ashes to Ashes is probably one of my favorite music vids of all
time--totally spooky and eerie.  Cool that it would have an affect/influence
on Kate.

So, here are the details.

I'll pick anybody up.

IT'S REALLY HAPPENING TO YA! :-)

Well James,

Yes, I have had the briefest, surrealest, heart-racing, fan-like 
sort of contact with Kate.  

December 1993, Tower Records, New York City.  Five hours waiting 
in the chill, quaking as the buzz moved through the line that 
*she* had arrived.  Harassing and delighting my co-fans by 
whipping out a tape recorder and getting their on-the-scene 
thoughts about KateFandom and being there for the big approaching 
moment.  Getting inside the store, seeing the videos playing, the 
Red Shoes backdrop, just the top of the brunette head.  And then, 
her in sight.  Really her!  *HER*, for godsakes!!!  This woman 
who, unknown to her, was one of my closest friends through 
adolescense.  I held tight clenched hands with a white-faced 
woman who'd been a stranger hours before, as we moved to the 
front of the line, just barely able to make out the tiny familiar 
voice offering warm words to dazed fans.  It was painful.  To 
know this would all be over so soon...what to say?? Remember to 
look her in the eye.  Remember to say something somewhat 
intelligent.  Remember to give her the book you bought her.  
Remember to touch her hand.

My turn!!!!
