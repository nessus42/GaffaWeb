Hi!

Saw Tori in NYC on Friday.  Very neat show- compared to when I saw her in
April the experience wasn't as mind-blowingly intense, although I did have
to remind myself to breathe on more than one occasion.  She seems to have
gotten past the stage where each song is still a numbing catharsis for her
(with the exception of "Me And A Gun", naturally), so she can speak between
songs without having to choke out every word.  She really is quite funny.
I was pleasantly surprised, since I would have expected her to be rather
bored with her material after performing it nonstop for almost a year now-
but she seemed to be having fun with it all.  Her voice is starting to show
signs of strain, though- I'm sure those vocal chords will be happy when December
rolls around!

woj and I waited well over an hour by the stage door afterwards (what the
hell, it was a nice night :), and at midnight she came out.  She had the
hug and smile for everyone, and she signed my shirt. :&gt;  I even had my camera
with me (not for that reason, but it was there), so we got pictures- I hope
they come out, I think I cut off woj's head because Tori is so short. :}

Next up is New Haven on 9 November, yay.
