Dear Friends,

It occurs to me that I have not said some things that I ought to. 
Firstly greetings to Andy Marvick , if he's anywhere that can receive 
this. 

Secondly many thanks to whoever it was who sent us the Love-Hounds 
baseball caps, some while ago. They have served us well - particularly 
mine own bald patch this Summer.

Greetings to ]&gt;oug. No electronic version of HOMEGROUND planned, I'm 
afraid.

Special greetings to Ron Hill. Ron - thankyou for sending me (some 
time ago) the first  edition  of  *Cloudbusting*,  together  with
associated pictures. Believe it or not it is only within the last few 
weeks that we have geared up here computerwise, sufficiently to read 
any of these. Our progress in the IT world since we obtained  our
trusty Commodore PC20III has been slow and painful. All I can say is 
that we are in awe of the work that has gone into the project. It is a 
work of reference for all in the Kate-speaking-world for years to 
come. When and if we can figure the technology, I'll try to download 
the second edition!

One of the many messages of welcome that we received mentioned that 
the Love-Hounds may now feel like a class of school-kids after teacher 
has arrived. I hope not. Actually HOMEGROUND has been  a  passive
associate of gaffa since its inception. With a few short gaps, I have 
read or skimmed almost every article that has ever been posted. I have 
followed the news, the flame wars and even the sometime brutally frank 
opinions on HOMEGROUND with varying degrees of interest, amusement, 
and sadness. Of particular interest this year was the debate with 
Kevin Hendrix as the various virtues of the net as opposed to the 
printing press.

Our view is quite simple. We consider HOMEGROUND to be a magazine of 
record in the Kate-speaking-world. Therefore I have been pinching news 
and information off gaffa ever since the beloved founder ]&gt;oug set the 
newsgroup going. I have always acknowledged the source. In return I 
have sought (usually via Vickie and Chris) to disseminate important 
information via gaffa. In the Kate-speaking-world I tend  to  see
HOMEGROUND as the London *Times* and gaffa as Reuter. We interact to 
serve Kate's fans the better.

As to mine and HOMEGROUND's role in gaffa, I hope it will be take part 
as and when we can. Our primary responsibility is to our subscribers - 
and though they are all to well aware of our tendency to be late, 
their patience is not endless. I shouldn't be here chatting when I 
should be typing articles.

This is the appropriate place to issue apologies for the lateness of 
issue 45. We assumed that a compilation issue would be fairly simple 
to knock out. Not so, it actually took more work, care and attention 
than our usual issues. It may be some solace to those who waited with 
fading patience, that for about ten days Krys was up to the early 
hours of the morning struggling with the layout. On at least  two
nights we retired at gone 4am.

Talking of Krys, she has a request. She has an artistic project on 
hand at the moment that requires a quantity of leaves, the more exotic 
and Autumnal the better. She'd be extremely grateful if anyone could 
send her leaves from non-British trees to: POBox 176, Orpington, Kent, 
BR5 3NA, England. Many thanks to anyone who can help.

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
