        Hello everyone.  Sorry I haven't been all that active here 
lately (aside from the faq and quotes), but I've been going through 
massive (and positive) changes the last seven weeks.  I haven't even 
worked on Cloudbusting/Deeper Understanding at all during this time!  
*GASP* :-) 

        Welcome to the Homeground crew.  Thanks to Peter for his kind 
words on Cloudbusting.  (wait'll you see Deeper Understanding).  I'm 
almost certain that you do, in fact, have the second (and latest) 
edition of Cloudbusting, which came out back in April of this year (the 
first edition came out last year).   Are there still any plans for a 
computerized version of FIVE YEARS AGO (my favorite HOMEGROUND 
section).  Why did Kate decide it was not a good idea to release the 
odd's and sod's discs????  If there are any of the articles that I've 
compiled lately that you need, let me know and I can shoot em off to 
 
you.  
        I guess I'm in the minority regarding Peter Gabriel's US album. 
 IE, I don't like it so much.  People have in the past drawn analogies 
between Kate and Peter's albums as in Security and The Dreaming being 
simulur and The Hounds of Love and So being simular.  I would tend to 
extend this to say US and The Sensual World being simular, in that they 
both are somewhat disappointing.  I think the best way to sum up how I 
feel about US is that the songs all seem to be _about_ things more so 
then being _experiences_ of things.  A famed review of Peter's past 
work said something like "you don't listen to a Peter Gabriel album so 
much as _experience_ it" and that's what is missing, for me.  
Apparently Peter's gone through a lot of therapy lately and the album 
sounds a lot like someone _sitting_ and talking about various parts of 
their life, rather then projecting the experience through the music.  
So far none of the songs have effected me like several of the songs 
from each of his last couple of albums.
        Needless to say this is simply my opinion and it may change 
tommorrow, five years from now, etc. 


        
        Regarding the description of the Trio that someone (no name 
that I could find), firstly you state that Kate was not the first 
"popular" musician to notice them.  Kate first "noticed" them back 
around 1985 and went to work with them before they became "big", though 
the album came out after.  Were there other "popular" artists that 
worked with them before they were popular in the west?  Also, you state 
that you presume she worked with the Trio rather then the whole choir 
due to "economics".  I don't believe Kate has mentioned the Choir at 
all, and has always said that it was the _Trio_ on the tape that she 
heard way back when, though it's almost certain she's heard the whole 
Choir by now.  So I think it's more likely that she worked with the 
Trio only cause that's what she wanted.  


        In regards to RUTH and the sexual element, I should say that 
when I first heard it, and the first couple of years after that, it 
seemed to me to be entirely a song about sex.  I never took the trouble 
to try to read the lyrics (which I didn't have anyways) and that 
reading of the song made sense, due to the feel of the song.  ALthough 
I've, of course, since learned that Kate wrote it about two lovers who 
wish they could swap place so that they could understand each other 
better, etc.  Still, the sexual aspect of the song is (for me) still 
very strong, as it is for many people when they first hear the song.  
It's also difficult to know to what extent the "problems in their 
relationship" were sexual.

        Time to remember what Kate's said: 


        "It means a lot to me if people are interpreting the music in 
the way that I originally wanted it to be done.  But, I do feel that 
music is a bit like a painting, in that when you buy a painting, it's 
because you like it.  And what is important is your interpretation of 
what it means.  That's why it means so much to you.  I think that 
applies to records as well.
        "But, as long as people are getting enjoyment out of them, I 
don't think it matters to me.  It doesn't worry me if they don't 
understand the way that I'd hoped they would. But of course it's always 
nice if they do." - KATE BUSH   (1983, Voc'l)
