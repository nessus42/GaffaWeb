Thought that I'd fill you in on the Trio Bulgarka... you ask where they 
are from, huh??? ( Boy are you going to feel embarrassed...)  The Trio 
Bulgarka are from Bulgarka, or as we know it, Bulgaria.  Kate was not the 
first "popular" musician to notice them, and they are commonly sampled 
for dance mixes, etc.. The first domestic record label to actually 
break this form of music successfully was Electra/Nonesuch, I believe, 
with the Albu"Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares", which was promoted very 
intelligently through a lot of very ecclectic radio stations, from New 
Age to Jazz to College Alternative.  What was surprizing was the great 
critical acclaim that the album found from all formats and the great word 
of mouth acclaim.  The material on the "Mystere" recordings was recorded 
by the entire Women's Choir of Sophia, and the Trio Bulgarka are three of 
the primary vocalists that have done independent recording from the 
rest of the chorus. As to why Kate picked recording with the Trio as 
opposed to the whole chorus, I woulld write that off to economics..  

The history of this type of music stems back many hundreds of years from 
various sections of the greater Bulgarian and Macedonian area, and they 
are essentially folk songs. Bulgarian folk music is noticably different 
between one section of Bulgaria and another, and has been influenced from
many of the surrounding cultures. During the '50's, I believe, the 
government of Bulgaria really created the Chorus as we know it today, in 
an attempt to protect the then dissappearing traditional folk music and 
culture. The person most responsible for the success of the chorus was 
Phillip Koetev, who was the first conductor.  The chorus soon became a 
regular addition to Radio Sophia.  Koetev took the early folk material 
and expanded on it, creating a form of music that was uniquely different 
from the simple peasant's folk songs, but still just as vital, alive and 
culturally important.  Several of the recordings from the 50's have been 
re-released, but I suspect there were a few imported vinyl recordings of 
this material.

Today, both the whole Women's Chorus and the Trio tour regularly, and 
have played across the country to large, sold out crowds. The Trio 
Bulgarka are: Yanka Rupkina, Stoyanka Boneva, and Eva Georgieva. I would 
reccomend that if you are interested in their music, you first get "Le 
Mystere des Voix Bulgares", as it is easiest to order and still probably 
the best recording available.

Limitted Discography - there are more recordings than these. Can someone 
add any other additions??? 
"Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares" Electra/Nonesuch 
"Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares, Vol. II"  Electra/Nonesuc
"Music of Bulgaria" Electra/Nonesuch
"The Mysterious Voices of Bulgaria" Laserlight
"Balkana: The Music of Bulgaria" Hannibal
"The Trio Bulgarka: The Forest is Crying" Hannibal

I would also reccomend a San Francisco bay area chorus called Kitka, as 
they have recorded a very good collection of traditional European folk, 
including lots of Bulgarian folk songs. They are having a concert soon at 
the Flint Center, I believe, for Amnesty International.  To contact Kitka 
for information on their album, the adress is:
Kitka

Oakland, CA 94612
