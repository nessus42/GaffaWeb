Hello Brian, you wrote:
&gt;&gt; The first time I read this: ??? :-) ??? :-)) 
&gt; Sorry, but you do seem to have responded on my thoughts coherently to how
&gt; I was trying to word them. 

I interpreted them the way, that you meant KaTe forgot about the original
meaning of the words. I can't believe that. Mmmmh. Okay. Everything is fine
then?

&gt; I agree with the twilight concept, although I've been thinking about when
&gt; does something keep coming forward but never moving? Perhaps, it could
&gt; mean "owning up" as in coming forward with information. But remember "he
&gt; won't answer me", so a bird song could fit this, consider a stationary
&gt; bird, singing its song, but only when it wants to. As they do. 

I have an idea for almost everything. So I do have one for the 'he keeps
coming forward, but never moving'. 
Remember a lake with a wind-induced current. And a bird standing still in
the water. Then, with little waves it may look like the bird is moving
through the water without actually moving. 
(I experience a similar thing quite often, when kayaking on a lake with
headwind...) 
What do you think?

&gt;&gt; Thank you IED for resolving the line  
&gt;&gt; "Rest and sing lover..." !!!  
&gt;&gt; Why can I hear it so easy now? 
&gt;
&gt; I still cannot! But I do have the CD Home Demos (ie not the best
&gt; quality).
&gt; Trouble is I cannot hear where the 'v' would be?  

Okay, there's not much of a 'v', but 'lover' is still the best
approximation of it. Or do you have any other idea?

To stir up more confusion, what about:   
       "rest in sin lover"?
This will get in conflict with the bird concept.

&gt;&gt; The Garden lists the lyrics as "I've called him by every name I know,
&gt;&gt; By every name I know" but to me it sounds more like "I've called him
&gt;&gt; every name I know, By every name I know". 
&gt;
&gt; Sorry, I can definately hear the first "by" (and the second one too). I
&gt; too can hear the frustration (not quite) or more emotional feeling in
&gt; the way it is sung, also emphasised by the repeating of the phrase. 

She sings: " 'called him b'every name I know, by every name I know..."
A very blurred 'b...every', but it's definitely 'by', IMHO. 

Is there a double meaning in the destiny line?
"Is there no destiny here?" 
1. There has to be a destiny to move to come forward. 
2. Destiny in the meaning of 'fate'?

"NO FATE" (Sarah Connor, T2)

Best wishes

PS:
"He keeps coming: Forward."   (KaTe)
