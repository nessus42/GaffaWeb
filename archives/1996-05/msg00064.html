What does this mean?
This question arises every year or so and IED's canonical answer is always
that JB is John C. Bush, who is into martial arts. This is a good guess,
but yesterday I found this interview quote:

(from: The Dreaming Debut  Radio 2  Sept. 13, 1982)

I: ... And Colin [who called in] also says, "in Sat In Your Lap cover
   it's written 'well done J.B....'" and he wants to know who J.B. is. 
K: J.B. is a guy called John Barrett who certainly deserves to be
   congratulated 'cause he did something very clever. [Laughs] 
I: Very clever, you're not going to tell us anything further. No? 
K: Nope! 

Now, have a look at the SIYL sleeve: A John Barrett is listed under the
assistant engineers!

Best wishes

Classical Kate-quotes:

- "I don't think I'm beautiful" ...
- "I never went out and beat up old ladies or became an alcoholic at
   school"...
- "Talking about myself is really boring"...
- "I don't know why people think my songs are strange - perhaps it's
   because I bathe in goats milk"...
- "Childish thinks amuse me, visual humour, slapstick, rude noises and
   silly faces"...
- "And please don't call me an elf again, I'm sick of it, I'm not an elf,
   I'm a woman. I'm not the little goody-goody everybody thinks I am."
- "I'd rather hang on to madness than normality"...
- "Some lyrics take a long time to come, others just come out like...
   like... diarrhoea."...
- "There will always be some who are irritated by me. I seem to irritate a
   lot of people, and in a way that's quite a good thing." ...
- [About The Dreaming album] "But I think a load of people won't like it.
   They probably won't understand what it's about." 
- [Love:] "It's just a terrible feeling, the thought of people having
   gone without the right amount of feedback. I think that really fucks
   people up." 
- "I have a lot of vivid dreams, most of which I can't mention."
- [About Deeper Undertanding] "I dont have a downer on computers at all. I
   think they're really good and very important" 
- [About Love and Anger] "Really, it was a bugger, that song. And in some
   ways I *still* don't know what I'm wanting to say. But what the hell..."
- "There's some really bad stuff happening in pop music, isn't there?"
