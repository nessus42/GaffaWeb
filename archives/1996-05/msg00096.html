&gt;"Mike" prefers Tori Amos because of her presumed work ethic. 
"Patrick"
&gt;simply says Mike has no taste. Although I do think Kate Bush is the
&gt;superior artist, I too think that she does one or two things that are
a
&gt;detriment to her career.
&gt;
&gt;One, she may spend much too much time on recording individual songs
and
&gt;albums, going over material, sound, instruments, so much that she
loses
&gt;perspective on them.  I doubt if she has much critical feedback from
&gt;anybody, and she probably rules the recording studio.  The results
have
&gt;often been disappointing, after such a long wait, to hear material
which
&gt;often seems to be re-treads of older themes and musical explorations.
&gt;Let's face it, Kate Bush does not ALWAYS move forward artistically
(last
&gt;two albums being cases in point).  I, for one, wouldn't mind her being
&gt;challenged to write and record a song very quickly, down and dirty, to
&gt;shake up her artistic process.
&gt;
&gt;Two, she is from a privileged, upper class family and has lived in
&gt;comfortable circumstances all her life.  I am not saying she can't be
a
&gt;great artist because of this, but I think that a comfortable lifestyle
&gt;often works against giving an artist the edge necessary to rise above
&gt;circumstances (whatever those may be) to achieve good works.  Has she
been
&gt;lazy?  Has she taken too many vacations?  Has she simply lived her
live
&gt;away from music for awhile?  These questions can't be answered
&gt;definitively, but there's no reason to assume that Kate Bush lives
with her
&gt;music (and music production) 24 hours a day.  And, I'm suggesting,
because
&gt;of her economic/lifestyle/class situation, she has more options than
just
&gt;working...at her art, or anything else.
&gt;
&gt;So, perhaps Tori Amos is hungrier, leaner, more productive, because
she
&gt;wants more...out of life, out of music, out of art, who can say.  And
no
&gt;record company is going to let an opportunity go by to capitalize on a
&gt;musician's desire to create and produce product.

&gt;
Well, after the 1980 releaes of "Never for Ever," Kate gave us in 2
years an end result called, "The Dreaming."  If that's what Kate writes
when speeding herself up, I'll be the first in line to buy her next LP.
