Hi!

This whole Tori vs. Kate thing has ceased to be amusing.

Those who refuse to listen to the real deal, i.e. Tori herself stating that
the only Kate Bush album she owns is _Hounds Of Love_, and while she liked
it a lot when she first heard it she hasn't listened to it in years, while
being 100% open and honest about who her influences are (Led Zeppelin and
Joni Mitchell) will never listen, and it's useless to try to convince them.
These are the same people who have heard her art director, Cindy Palmano
(who was completely and utterly responsible for the cover of _Little
Earthquakes_, as Tori didn't have enough clout with the record company at
that time to have much of a say in such things) state that she had never
even seen the cover of _The Kick Inside_ before doing the shoot (which makes
perfect sense, since the only Kate-in-a-box shot is the AMERICAN version of
TKI, and Palmano is British and as far as I know has lived her entire life in
the UK), and declare that she's a liar.

Tori and Cindy Palmano aren't politicians, folks -- why are so many people
outright refusing to believe what they say in answer to direct questions???
Just because Kate has lied in interviews doesn't mean everybody else does it
too.

I recommend that the people who refuse to abandon the charade that Tori Amos
is a ripoff of Kate Bush go into their own corner, and those of us who know
better stay in ours.  Crikey, someone just mentioned that he's heard A NEW
SONG BY KATE BUSH, and *nobody* seems to have picked up on that, for goddess'
sake!

So tell us Peter, what's the Gaelic song like, aside from perfectly pronounced?
