&gt;Not to fan the flames or anything, but I caught part of the video for  
&gt;"Caught a Lite Sneeze" on VH1 last evening, and it was quite...  
&gt;interesting as well. 
 
I thought it was beautiful, but I'm not sure what it has to do with the
song... But then, Tori's always been abstract like that. 
 
&gt;Tori's still finding her voice.  Let's give her a few years and see where 

&gt;she ends up.   
 
I don't think she's finding her voice, really. She seems to have found it
quite well to me.  
 
&gt;I don't see her so much as a Kate knock-off as someone who is working in  
&gt;the same territory.  She's like Kate's pissed-off, petulent (sp?) American
 
&gt;cousin.  They don't really play the same style of piano, even.  There  
&gt;just aren't that many simularities IMO. 
 
Oh, thank you. 
 
&gt;However, anyone who could look  
&gt;me in the eye and tell me that Tori has never heard "The Dreaming" needs
to  
&gt;be committed to an insane asylum.   
 
I'd try but you're not here to look in the eye. I have no idea whether or
not she's heard The Dreaming, but.... 
 
&gt;Listen to "Precious Things" off "Little  
&gt;Earthquakes" and then play the track "The Dreaming", paying particular  
&gt;attention to the flanged whispery vocals, and you'll see what I mean.  
 
I don't get this comparison either. I guess it's just because I never saw
Kate's vocals in "The Dreaming" as whispery. Whatever. But anyway, I don't
get the logic that singing similarly implies she's heard The Dreaming. Ah
well. 
 
&gt;Now, if you want to hear someone REALLY rip off Kate, check out Heather  
&gt;Nova's vocals on "Island" on her new album. 
 
&lt;gulp&gt; I guess this is deny a Kate influence day. I don't see any
similarity between Nova's vocals and Kate's either. In fact, were I to
assign Nova a ripoff-ee, it'd be either Tori herself or (more likely) Sarah
McLachlan. Her voice just doesn't sound anything like Kate's, to me. It's
waaaaaaay too smooth, hardly any vibrato, whereas Kate's voice is
absolutely full of vibrato.  
 
&gt;OB Kate: Channel surfing before work yesterday, I caught MuchMusic  
&gt;playing the HoL video.  What a great moment!  I love MuchMusic.  They  
&gt;play stuff that I never see on eMpTV. 
 
I'm insanely jealous.
