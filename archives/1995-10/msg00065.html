Hi all!
    I recently received my very own copy of the 1994 Love Hounds 
collection (thanks Thomas Estes!) and wanted to complement the people who 
were involved in the creation of these tapes!  You guys are the greatest 
- take a bow.  I have acheived true katefan Nirvana!  The liner notes are 
fascinating and extremely informative.  It's truly an amazing place, the 
Love Kennel &lt;pause and think warm, happy thoughts for a moment&gt;.  Where 
did you guys get these clips?

2 questions:
1)   who is the bass player in the "Rocket Man" video?
2)  Kate seems to have a knack for working with strong bassists.  Del and 
Eberhard Weber are extremely talented musicians,  and Kate's recordings 
always have outstanding fretless bass work.  Imagine my surprise upon 
seeing the live HoL video          from the Secret Policeman's Ball, to 
see Tony Franklin (at least he looked and played like Tony Franklin) on 
stage playing          with Kate! (For those of you who don't know, Tony 
played bass with the Firm and is an outstanding fretless player as well.) 
          Was that indeed Tony Franklin, and how did he get so lucky?  
Who were the other members of Kate's band for that particular 
performance?  And finally, why is Kate into the bass so much (or is this 
possibly Del's influence)?

I guess that's more than 2 questions :-)

The live HoL gave me just enough of a taste of what Kate could do live 
that I am now extremely rabid for a tour, which I know won't happen, but 
what if it did?
