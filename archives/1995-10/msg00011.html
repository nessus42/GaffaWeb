ALEA III

Alea III is the contemporary music ensemble in residence at Boston
University, a group devoted to promoting, playing, and teaching music of
the twentieth century. Founded in 1978, Alea III is the third such group
organized by Music Director T heodore Antoniou.  The ensemble is
consistent with the music it embraces---flexib le in size, open to
experiment and to exploration.  Over the years, Alea III has offered
world-premiere opportunities for dozens of contemporary composers, often
under the composer's direction, and with extended program notes or
comments.  The group has performed over 650 works by more than 400
composers---most of them liv ing.  With its inspiration, dozens of other
contemporary groups have been formed,offering growing opportunity to young
composers and musicians to play and compre hend contemporary music. 

The Greek word alea taken from Homer, means "to wander."  In Latin, it
refers to "a die or dice used for playing at games of chance."  The term
aleatoric music in dicates music based upon the principles of
indeterminacy as evidenced by certain random and/or statistical procedures
of composition.  In regard to the ensemble, aleatoric is concerned with
the expression of a multiplicity of musical direction s, historical
styles, and performance practices.
