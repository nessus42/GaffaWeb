sorry. i had to do that.

anyway, i, too, am a bi Kate fan and have been told of my "obsession" with her
that, as with my fondness for Madonna and Judy Garland and Katherine Hepburn
and comic books and just about every other worthy artist/artform in western
culture that it is "just a gay thing." that i like kate (or ___) because i am
queer. anybody else run into this?

i must admit that the first times i heard _kashka_ and _wow_ there was a
special thrill because she was talking about ME, but other than such topical
references to queer issues in her lyrics, does anybody out there think kate has
some sort of specific "gay appeal"?

and on a _somewhat_ related topic, what do folks think of kate's attitude
toward feminism? i was rereading _kate bush: a visual documentary_ today (i
hadn't noticed the first time through how repetitious and somewhat poorly
organized it is. anybody know of a more comprehensive and better organized
bio?) and i ran across a quote that ran something like, "i've been accused of
being a feminist. . . . "

kate seems to deliberately eschew any sort of affiliation like that. even in
the night flight interview (i think so, anyway) there was some sort of
tangential issue or brief question. oh i remember--it was about whether or not
it was harder for a woman to get the control that kate has, or something like
that.

my question for british katefans is this: is she just as deliberately
apolitical (or unaffiliated, i guess i should say) about, say, national
politics in the u.k.? i can never seem to tell which side of the ireland
question sinead is on - she seems to hvae changed her mind at some point. does
kate, with her own irish roots, have any publicly expressed view on this or
other issues "over there"?
