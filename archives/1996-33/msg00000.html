Alan --

&gt; The way the track builds up as it gets to the part saying "Hello, I
&gt; know..." and all that - it's maybe it's not meant to be realistic, but
&gt; more to portray the feeling that this person is getting from having 
&gt; the computer to 'talk' to... that it's their friend, and they feel
&gt; comfortable with it - I mean, how else could she represent it
&gt; realistically apart from a lyric like "Damn Windows - it's crashed
&gt; again"?

Surprisingly, I find myself somewhat affected by your argument, a bit.

&gt; Sure, the "I press execute" part is a badly chosen lyric, but
&gt; that's one line out of the whole song...

It only takes one incorrect detail to destroy credibility, and that 
one's a WHOPPER.  If I haven't been paying much attention to the song up 
to that point (because this is my 83rd listening, because even Kate's 
worst album is better than most artists' best), the "press execute" line 
will be enough to make me cringe, anyway.  It makes me doubt whether or 
not Kate has ever sat down in front of any computer other than a 
Fairlight.

But I certainly respect you sticking up for Kate.  I know I do it.  The 
most common complaint I hear is that she's precious, affected, 
self-conscious, cutesy.  Even if you didn't already know it, you could 
probably guess that she's the spoiled youngest child of an affluent 
family.  I can kind of see that criticism, but I forgive it because Kate 
has such an incredible range, and she tackles so much more in her music 
than practically anybody else.

&gt; Alan.

Oh, and I have an opinion on that, too: You spelled it wrong!

Allen
