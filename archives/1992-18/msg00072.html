It's a wonderful feeling to find some (new) music
which you feel is something special.
kd lang : Ingenue is such music.

I'd never heard of kd lang until a local (ABC FM)
radio station played a couple of tracks off her recent
album (Ingenue) and a local paper (Age green guide)
reviewed the same.

I have since found out that she is a canadian, post-country
performer with a number of releases to her credit.
Local media (as they love to do) have also informed us that she's
a lesbian (but who gives a shit, that's her business. If it is true,
however, it is appropriate as her lyrics are a-sexual in nature).

Now... to the request (either e-mail or to the e-net)...
Are there any long term fans out there who could inform me
of her previous releases and their merit (in your opinion)?
I'd appreciate it.
One (album) is never enough.

An observation. How come there seems to be sooo many good
canadian musicians who don't get a break over here (Australia)?
Egs. Bruce Cockburn, kd l, Jane Siberry, the Nylons. Even Anne Murray.
I'm sure there are others.
The last Canadian band to get 'the push' over here (IMHO) was Loverboy.
Remember them? Remember the leathers? Were they pink or orange?
To any Canadians who may be listening, do the big markets (UK and USA)
snub Canadian artists as regularily as Aust. seems to or are the artists
I listed 'fringe' in your country too. 
Aust is dominated by the Jimmy Barnes, John Farnham, Midnight Oil 
sound with a big dollup of post-Stock-A-W disco fodder and pseudo-heavy-
metal-pooncy-hair-gell-prancing-pinup-pretty-boy bands from the USA.
(Don't forget, Aus readers, only MY humble prejudice. You're welcome
to disagree. I do like Farnsie and the bald one.)

That's enough. I'd like to initiate a discussion on the superior sounds
of lesbian performers (kd?, Two Nice Girls, Tracy Chapman) but perhaps
another time.
