        I: Do you follow the reviews and would you be upset if there are 
some not completely complimentary reviews?  
        K: I don't follow them that much.  I read the main ones that I've 
personally done.  There are lots of articles that are written where I've 
not even spoken to the person whose writing it - again this is something 
that I think the public don't realize.  But I have read things that 
aren't totally uncomplimentary and really it's just someone else's 
opinion, so it's not any problem.
        I: We come to a track called "Army Dreamers" and this is a sad 
tale, one that has been treated in music several times before: the young 
boy who doesn't become a man, comes home from war having been killed.  
But this is from a woman's perspective rather than a man's, which is what 
we usually get in pop songs.  Do you think you've been able to present us 
with a different perspective? 
        K: I hope so.  As you say, this area has been covered a lot and 
actually it's talking about the mother's point of view where she's let 
her son join the army; doesn't matter how he was killed, it was probably 
an accident in fact, he probably wasn't killed in battle at all.  But she 
goes over his younger life and thinks when he wanted a guitar and that 
maybe if he'd had a guitar he'd have turned into a pop star rather than a 
soldier and if she'd have been able to give him a good education he might 
have turned into a politician.  She's grieving over her motherhood and 
thinking that it's her fault because she let him go and she thinks there 
are perhaps lots of boys who would rather be pop stars and politicians 
than join the army, but joining the army is much easier. 
        I: Do you yourself look forward to motherhood? 
        K: I really don't know.  I don't think I look forward to it 
because I don't know whether I would ever be a mother.  I think it's an 
incredibly responsible job and something that you have to learn about - 
it's not natural, I think it's something you really have to learn about 
and be prepared to make tremendous sacrifices for.  And while I have such 
a strong love with my mother still obsessive in me I can't really see me 
being a mother, it would be so unfair. 
        I: The greatest love one has tends to be an obstacle towards the 
exercise of all the others? 
        K: Yes.  Yes, that's true. 
        I: You've given a thank to a chap called Kevin McAllier for 
playing you Chopin.  Did he soothe you with his playing? 
        K: Yes.  What used to happen was when we were rehearsing for the 
tour and things like leads were being clicked up, Kevin McAllier, who was 
our keyboard player, would just sit and play Clair de Lune, and some 
lovely Chopin nocturne.  I just love watching people play it because it's 
things I can never play on the piano, I was never classically taught.  
It's beautiful to hear someone play a piece of music on the piano, it's 
just incredible.  It used to really help me a lot and because Kevin 
helped us on a track that didn't actually go on the album, it was so 
important that he got a credit because he's a fantastic musician. 
        I: The last track on the album, previously released as a single, 
is "Breathing" and this is also war related.  I am wondering if the 
sequence thing of this album is intentional, that army dreamers go right 
into "Breathing"?
        K: No, the sequence wasn't really meant to be like that.  When 
you do put the songs together the most unexpected ones will link and the 
ones that you thought so obviously would flow into each other just sound 
so wrong.  And that just happened to be the way they seemed to flow.  It 
was quite unintentional they should be placed together. 
        I: This is a song whi: Has this terrible threat of nuclear war 
persuaded you to do anything in a more overtly political way or to write 
any more songs about the subject? 
        K: I'm very wary of it because as you know I don't really write 
politically at all.  On this album it's the first time I've dealt in this 
are and it was only because it moved me emotionally that I went into the 
political.  Unless something else political can get my emotions, I 
wouldn't, I would rather stay away because there are so many good writers 
that deal with these areas a lot.  It would have to be something very 
special for me to feel that I could do better than them. 
        I: That's all the tracks on the album.  Are you convinced that 
this is your absolute best so far? 
        K: Yes, absolutely convinced that it's my best so far.  But again 
I feel there's just so much more to do that in so many ways this is like 
the first album again; it's like a new beginning to grow from and that's 
very exciting.  I hope people will like it but it's certainly set a new 
stone for me to build upon. 
        I: You mentioned there's a least one unreleased track - are there 
tracks we will never hear or will they come out as singles?
        K: I think they'll come out.  Some of them have already come out 
as B sides, tracks that weren't on the album we put on the B sides of 
singles.  That's something I've always wanted to do, it's so good to give 
the public something not on the album, especially if they're going to buy 
that too.  It's quite exciting because you can dig up little novelty 
tracks that you've forgotten all about that you did years ago and for a B 
side they're smashing because they're one off and people have never heard 
them and it's a monument in time that may be from years ago. 
        I: You mentioned there are some ideas for you now as you consider 
your next recorded work - do you think you will do more recording next or 
will you do live work or will yo go home to the farm and think about it? 
        K: As I was saying, I really don't know.  I want to do both so 
badly - the logical move would be to tour next but I'm so worried about 
making that decision, it's a long piece of time to give away and I want 
to do an album so badly.  It's very difficult for me at this time to 
choose.  I hope that as the months pass now with this promotion the 
answer will clink in my head - it always does that at the last minute.
        I: So Kate Bush, two and a half years in the limelight and you're 
not jaded yet? 
        K: I hope not, no. 
        I: Thanks very much. 
        K: Thank you.
