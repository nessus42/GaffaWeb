&gt;&gt;  My reactions EXACTLY to seeing Tori at the Birchmere in DC.  My wife and I 
&gt;&gt; had the opportunity to chat with her briefly after the performance and I was
&gt;&gt; struck with how warm she was with Kathy and how distant she was with me.  I 
&gt;&gt; wasn't offended, but sort of saddened.  
&gt;&gt;   Fortuntately, Kathy picked up the ball and got our CD autographed for me!

&gt;Hum, when a group of us saw her in MA, we talked with her after the
&gt;show.  She seemed very friendly and I didn't get *any* impression that
&gt;she "doesn't like men".  How do the others that were there feel?
&gt;Greg?  Jess?

Here I am, finally :) I must agree with dave wholeheartedly! Tori was
not only warm and friendly with *all* of us, but I also saw her being
very warm/friendly with other men - she hugged a few of them!!
definitely not a problem with men - Even if it were true that she
wouldn't want to *date* men (and there is so far no real evidence
towards that), it certainly doesn't mean she doesn't like and wouldn't
befriend a man. Anyway, from things she said in interviews posted
recently, I don't get the impression that she "dislikes" men at all.
