kd lang -- used to be country, but the country rednecks didn't like
the fact that she was a lesbian or that she was anti-beef.  Whether
that had anything to do with her switching styles is hard to say ;-)

The only thing I've really listened to her on is the Jane Siberry
and kd lang version of "Calling All Angels" from the "Until the End of
the Earth" soundtrack.  The song is outstanding.  I get lots of music
rags, and the reviews of lang's new one all say 1) it's not country,
and 2) it's very good.  I plan on getting it.  I'd love to hear from
other lovehounds who have Ingenue...

Comments on Sarah M.'s newest "Solace":  The album starts out very
strong for 2 cuts ("Drawn to the Rhythm", "Into the Fire"), slips
slightly for a few songs, looses direction entirely as she starts
sounding a bit like Sinead O., but finishes strong with the Donovan
cover.  I don't know if it is intentional, or if the monitors they
used during the mix were bass-shy, or what, but there is some VERY
serious bass on this album, expecially the first several cuts.  Oh,
on the same topic the tape from the Sarah tape tree was most disappointing
due to the fact that the FM signal kept fading in and out.  It went
from stereo to mono to static very often.  Mostly mono.  If anyone
has a real good tape of that radio broadcast please get ahold of me;
I have lots to trade ;-)

Kate's breast and nipple?  I don't think so, but I suppose it
could be.  Anyone have a real version of that poster who can take a closer
look?

As I continue to listen to Happy's cds my enthusiam doesn't wane.  I'm
still on the first two, though.  She sounds much more like Kate than
Tori!  I really think that most or all Kate fans would like the
1st two Happy CD's.  Watch this space for impressions of the other
two (Ecto and Rearment).
