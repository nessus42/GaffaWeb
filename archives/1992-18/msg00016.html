&gt; 
&gt; Hello again.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; My versions of "Rock vs. Opera"(1986), "Which Witch"(1987-13 tracks), and
&gt; "Which Witch paa Slottsfjellet"(1990-32 tracks) are all released on a label
&gt; called NB! Records (Nota Bene Records). I think it is a norwegian 
&gt; label. It may well be that their records are distributed abroad
&gt; (that is outside of Norway) by a larger label ??
&gt; 
  Could be...a number of groups here in Canada have a Canadian record 
company release their stuff here, and another that releases it 
worldwide...probably the best know of these bands is RUSH, who have their 
own label, ANTHEM RECORDS, here in Canada, and it used to be Mercury Records 
elsewhere, but that changed a while ago, and I have lost track of who 
releases there stuff out there...
 
&gt; 
&gt; The two first have definitely been released on CD (since I have them
&gt; myself), the last one I think is released on CD also, but I own the LP
&gt; version so I'm not completely sure.
 
   Thanx for the info...I will have to go down and harras my friend who is 
the manager of an alternative record store here in Ottawa....

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This thing about using/not using the Dolie de Luxe name is a bit complicated.
&gt; Both girls have repeatedly stated that they don't want to use the name
&gt; because it kind of links them to a 'pop' image. But when the time comes to
&gt; releasing records, they use it anyway. The reason, I guess, being that this
&gt; is the name people recognize (??) There are some indications that they are
&gt; gradually dropping the name: It is not included on the "Which Witch paa
&gt; Slottsfjellet" LP-cover; only on the inside sleeves. And they have stated
&gt; that the Rock Opera will definitely NOT be linked to this name when
&gt; performed in London.
&gt; 
   Well, John Couger nee John Couger Meloncamp nee John Meloncamp went 
through exactly that...the record company wanted a "commercial" name to 
release his stuff under, and come up with the "Couger" thing...but over the 
years he has gradually droped it, and now uses his real name.

&gt; 
&gt; How did you come across the video to "Eternally"?? I didn't know it had
&gt; ever been shown outside of Norway...
 
   They did an interview on Much Music, Canada's Music Video station, and 
they showed the videos for both "Satifaction/Queen of the Night" and 
"Eternally"...many of the Pagans I know are in love with the "Eternally" 
video...I have had to make a copy of the tape to play, since it has been 
played at least a couple of hundred times, and VHS tapes are not supposed to 
last much longer than that...
