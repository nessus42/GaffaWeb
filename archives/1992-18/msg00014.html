Jerome wonders:

&gt; Is anyone doing anything special for KaTemas this year, especially in
&gt; Cleveland, Ohio???

i will be nowhere near the good state of Ohio, but Jerome provides me
with the opportunity to remind one and all that your humble footah
(that's me, for all you new-comers -- goodness, it's been a while
since i have posted regularly to gaffa-hounds!) ANYway, ecto-goddess
jessica dembski and i will be hosting the northeastern US KaTe party
in cambridge, MA, and it is gonna be a DOOZY!  last time we had people
from canada and new jersey -- this year we have one promise from
atlanta, some small hope of a welsh/tennessean cat, and goodness knows
who else!  the festivities are in a mansion (no joke!) and will
include live music, homemade food, many many gaffa-recommended CDs by
alternative female musicians, plus oodles of KaTestuff!!!  plus, there
will be fabulous prizes, net access, laser-disks of KaTe's videos (i
hope), a group call to as many of the other parties as we can reach
(last year we were huddled around a tiny speaker listening to the
live music from the CA party -- i hope to find a better system this
time ;) maybe a few honored guests (|&gt;oug?), brand new old KaTemas
traditions (we had a cake last year, chicago had a tree, suggestions
for this year are welcome ;) etc. etc.

we have lots of room for people to crash (for the whole weekend!), and
lots of things for people to do -- the house is smack in the middle of
Harvard Square, an album and book shopping mecca, with cheap and
simple public transportation to boston and other tourist sights...

i am assuming that August 1 will be the day of choice, but if people
prefer the preceding weekend, let me know...  (the official
observation date for KaTemas is obviously a gaffa-wide decision :)

i'll make an official announcement as soon as i have a clue ;)  but in
the meanwhile, mark your calendars, buy those plane tickets, practice
bellowing WH at the top of your lungs, you've only got 9 weeks!!!

august will be footah again!
