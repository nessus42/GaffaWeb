	G'day all,

&gt;Hi all,


&gt;    Well, its been an amazing weekend! I have spend weeks reading Gaffa and 
&gt;hearing how all you guys are really enjoying the Tori concerts etc.. Well, I'm 
&gt;flicking around the telly on Friday night when I hit the intro for Tori on the 
&gt;"Tonight Live" show out of channel seven in Melbourne!! I got the whole thing on 
&gt;video including the interview after she sang Winter and I'll write it up and 
&gt;send it off to RDT soon (so don't worry Gaffa).

	I'll be speaking to Graham about this later - gimme, gimme, gimme!!

&gt;    They didn't mention any tour so I rang the show and asked. Nobody their knew 
&gt;if she was here to tour, I started to get the sinking feeling that her vist was 
&gt;just a pro-mo thing. I thought I'd kick myself for not having at least tried so 
&gt;I asked if I could talk to her. 10 minets later, I know I'm within one phone 
&gt;transfer of her when somebody steps in and pulls the plug :-( ...So close....

	You made up for that later didn't you Gra, gra!?!


&gt;    After that she appeared on some Saturday morning shows (I got them taped 
&gt;too) this included a bizzare segment where she was pounced upon by some women 
&gt;who then read the BACK of her hand!? FYI she was told she was told she isn't a 
&gt;"no person".


&gt;    Later on Saturday I picked up Drum Magazine a free publication, music guide 
&gt;etc. And there is Tori on the front cover, large interview in the middle AND the 
&gt;date of her ONE show in Sydney. It's 7:00pm TONIGHT!!! :-) 8-) I'm on my way 
&gt;with CD in hand for a signiture!!!

	Well I've just got back from it, (My flatmate and I drove from 
Wollongong to see her, it's about 100km away) we got back at about 11:30pm.

	YES!! I spoke to her. YES!! she autographed my copy of said magazine 
:-) for me as I don't yet have a copy of the CD :-(. I've pinned the bits on
my wall! I hugged her which she returned graciously! To those who think she
doesn't like men, let me just say that I found no sign of such animosity 
whatsoever!

	She is a beautiful _person_, and I don't just mean physically. She was
genuinely interested in all those who were there for autographs. And the whole
audience of course, but they weren't all backstage getting her autograph!

	All I can say is WOW!! 

	
&gt;- Graham
