Well, I'll let you folks be the judge of this review (for what it's
worth).  This is from the Cornell Daily Sun, Friday, October 27th.

TALES OF LOVE

by Karen E. Clements

Kate Bush's sixth studio album, _The Sensual World_, explores the
psychological facets of love amongst grand orchestral musical
arrangements.  Although not a typical pop album, _The Sensual
World_ contains little of the avant-garde musical and vocal experi-
mentation that marks her earlier albums.  Could Bush be attempting
to appeal to the mainstream and "sell out?" [punctuation sic]

Fortunately, this solid album contains many songs equal in emotion
and arrangement to such earlier popular masterpieces as "Hounds of
Love" and "Running Up That Hill."  The album presents two facets of
Bush -- the storyteller and the romantic.

As a storyteller, Bush weaves thought-provoking tales amidst theatrical
musical arrangements.  Set in 1939, "Heads We're Dancing" tells how a
dashing young man sweeps a young woman off her feet in a night of
dancing.  She opens the morning paper only to discover the horrible
identity of the young man: "They say that the Devil is a charming
man/And just like you I bet he can dance."  The quirky, funky beat
builds as one's curiosity mounts and the identity is finally revealed:
Hitler.  [Gee, thanks for relieving the suspense.]

On a slightly lighter note, "Deeper Understanding" follows.  In
desperation a lonely woman turns to her computer for companionship.
Bush illustrates the bizarre paradox that a human, unable to find any
understanding, turns to a computer, which has been stereotyped as the
epitome of impersonality.  Musically the Trio Bulgarka, female Indian [!]
backup singers, bring an ethereal atmosphere to the song.

Thematically, the album showcases Bush's knack for exposing the facets
of relationships.  The title track oozes sensuality.  Complimented [sic]
by exotic, erotic Uillean pipes, her glorious voice caresses every word.
Teasing, humorous lyrics keep the song right on the edge of being
steamy: "I said, mmh, yes/But not yet, mmh, yes."

"Love and Anger" deals with self-acceptance and coming to terms with the
past.  The rhythm of this uplifting song pulses with drums and bass while
Kate and Paddy Bush's vocals rise in a crescendo of joy.

Bush also delves into the darker side of relationships.  "The Fog" opens
with an eerie Joker-like cackle.  Bush compares falling in love with the
frightening experience of learning to swim: "This love of yours/Was big
enough to be frightened of/It's deep like the water was/The day I learned
to swim." [misquote sic]  A recorded male voice interjects with swimming
directions, further augmenting the song's unsettling quality.  And on
"Never Be Mine" Bush expresses the terrible pain of rejection with
haunting vocals and the bittersweet sounds of Uillean pipes.

_The Sensual World_ does contain some weak tracks.  The rhythm of "Reaching
Out" drags and pulls the repetitive lyrics with it.  "Rocket's Tail (For
Rocket)" tells an interesting story, but the abrasive electric guitar and
drums prove distracting.  Lastly, Bush's unusually nasal vocals make "Walk
Straight Down the Middle" a little annoying.

While not as conceptual or daring as her earlier albums, _The Sensual World_
presents an extremely talented and versatile artist.  And as always, her
marvelous voice ranges from a tentative lilt to resounding growls.  For
those new to Bush, this album introduces her as a wonderful storyteller and
vocalist in traditionally structured songs.  Longtime, more die-hard fans
will not be disappointed, as the album contains many strong tracks and
astute observations.
