&gt;*     A MAJOR REMINDER TO ALL INTERESTED LOVE-HOUNDS:
&gt;* The huge _TSW_ poster is still available: a "subway"-size poster
&gt;*(approximately 40 x 60 inches), made in the UK on nice, heavy paper.
&gt;*The poster is an "official" product from EMI, not a bootleg. It
&gt;*is the same poster that one Love-Hound (Jamie?) described seeing on
&gt;*an Edinburgh hoarding last week: there is no writing of any kind
&gt;*on the poster, only a huge blow-up, in black-and-white, of the
&gt;*photograph by John Carder Bush of Kate featured on the cover of her
&gt;*new UK single _The_Sensual_World_. In the photo Kate is seen in three-
&gt;*quarter perspective with her hands out in front of her, and with
&gt;*sand (or dust) slipping through her fingers. The ink is black, not
&gt;*the sepia-black "duo-tone" color used by John Carder Bush for the
&gt;*single itself, but IED has been assured that the print is first-
&gt;*rate and the darks are very rich in the poster.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know where I can buy this in England, or more specifically,
&gt;London? I've tried all the poster-selling shops that I know (HMV, Athena,
&gt;Tower, other small shops), and they ALL have posters of Bros and Kylie 
&gt;(ack, gag, barf), but NONE of them have any of KaTe AT ALL!!

John, (and other UK LoveHounds), there is a pretty good poster shop
in Camden which may just have this item. I can't for the life of me
remember the exact name of the shop, I think it may be called "The
Vintage Movie Poster Shop" or something like that. Anyway they carry
a large selection of posters from both the film and music worlds.
Quite a few are as large as described above. The last time I was in
there was before I heard about the availability of the "Sensual"
poster so I could have missed it. They do have other various posters
of Kate e.g "The Whole Story" cover, a "Lionheart" poster and a few
others, so this shop is well worth checking out. If you manage to 
get one and I don't ...... grrrrrh !! :-) 

I do hope this manages to get through to LH. I've being trying for
quite a while but have been having little success. Oh well ! (Hi
tracy !)

Ah ! I almost forgot to say where the above shop is. Well, come out
of Camden High Street tube station and turn right. Go down Camden High
Street (towards the market) and the shop is on the left hand side a few
hundred yards away from the tube. Its a bit tucked away so keep your 
eyes open !
