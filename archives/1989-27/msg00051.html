Michael Mendelson:
&gt; | &gt; [IED:] Had you noticed the _men's_ chorus in _Deeper_Understanding_?
&gt; | &gt; Or the lawnmower (motorcycle)? Have you got the extra lyrics at the end
&gt; | &gt; of that song yet? IED won't give them away if you haven't, but they
&gt; | &gt; are important lyrics in the song, and they have a surprise ending.
&gt; | 
&gt; | They sound to me like "I hate to leave you...  I hate to leave you...
&gt; | I hate to leave you...."  And then at the very end, "It isn't
&gt; | easy...."  This |&gt;oug takes to mean that the computer program that has
&gt; | been fairy godmother to Kate must leave now and let Kate stand on her
&gt; | own two feet.
&gt; | 
&gt; | |&gt;oug
&gt; 
&gt; I fail to see why the interpretation "Kate decides (or is forced by her
&gt; family who intervened) to leave the computer program for good" isn't 
&gt; equally plausible.  Perhaps she has decided that she no longer needs
&gt; the program as a crutch or escape from reality, but like all good things
&gt; which come to an end, leaving isn't easy.

As best as I can recall, the addition of the protaganist to her computer
is not resolved within the song. Her family removes her from the console,
but her desire to sit down and "press execute" does not seem to be eradi-
cated. Hence I think a more likely interpretation is that the protaganist
*still* wants to be with her computer, but is forced to, thus the protag-    
anist singing forlornly "I hate to leave you..." 

Comments?
