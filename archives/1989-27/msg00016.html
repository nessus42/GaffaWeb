HEINOUSLY BOLD STATEMENT #1:

CBS would have released _Reaching_Out_ as the U.S. single were it not
so short.

HEINOUSLY BOLD STATEMENT #2:

I have long since deciphered the "message" in _The_Ninth_Wave_'s
_Watching_You_Without_Me_. I shall submit my evidence for inspection
either (a) at the next West Coast Bush Bash I am able to attend, or
(b) at the London hotel we all descend upon the night before Her
first Wembley show (got _my_ fingers crossed!).

HEINOUSLY BOLD STATEMENT #3:

_The_Sensual_World_ is a continuation/follow-up/sequel to _The_
_Ninth_Wave_. I list for you just a few of the "similarities" found
in text and image. Most, but not all, references are of course pulled
completely out of context for the sole purpose of supporting this
heinously bold statement and could not possibly withstand even
the most fleeting of scrutiny. Editorial and commentary are
enclosed in [] brackets. _TNW_ references come first; _TSW_
references follow. Tongue held firmly in cheek, I start with the
obvious: 

TNW&gt;  Wish I had my radio
TNW&gt;  I'd tune into some friendly voices. (_And_Dream_Of_Sheep_)

  Just like a station on the radio
  I pick you up (_The_Fog_)

TNW&gt;  Like poppies, heavy with seed (_And_Dream_Of_Sheep_)
 
  Then I'd taken the kiss of [poppy]seedcake.. (_The_Sensual_World_)

[Both lines ruthlessly taken way out of context.]

TNW&gt;  There's something moving under
TNW&gt;  Under the ice,
TNW&gt;  Moving under ice.. (_Under_Ice_)

  It lay buried here, it lay deep inside me (_Love_And_Anger_)

TNW&gt;  I should have been home
TNW&gt;  Hours ago --- but I'm not here,
TNW&gt;  ...
TNW&gt;  Here in the room with you now,
TNW&gt;  ...
TNW&gt;  Just watching you without me
TNW&gt;  ...
TNW&gt;  You can't hear me, you can't hear what I'm saying
TNW&gt;  You didn't hear me come in
TNW&gt;  You won't hear me leaving. (_Watching_You_Without_Me_)

  I want you as the dream
  Not the reality
  ...
  But I'm looking back over my shoulder
  At you, happy without me.
  ...
  This is where I want to be
  But I know that this will never be mine. (_Never_Be_Mine_)
 
TNW&gt;  I get out of my car,
TNW&gt;  Step into the night,
TNW&gt;  And look up at the sky
TNW&gt;  And there's something bright
TNW&gt;  Travelling fast.
TNW&gt;  Look at it go
TNW&gt;  Look at it go. (_Hello_Earth_)
 
  That November night, looking up into the sky.
  ...
  I saw only a stick on fire
  Alone on its journey
  ...
  And now shooting into the night
  ...
  Look at me go with my tail on fire
  ...
  Hey, look at me go, look at me... (_Rocket's_Tail_)

TNW&gt;  Go to sleep little earth,
TNW&gt;  I was there at the birth. (_Hello_Earth_)
 
  It was '39 before the music started (_Heads_We're_Dancing_)
 
TNW&gt;  Out of the cloud burst the head of the Tempest, (_Hello_Earth_)
 
  You stepped out of a stranger. (_Heads_We're_Dancing_)
 
TNW&gt;  Murderer, Murderer, of calm, (_Hello_Earth_)

[Self-explanatory, and note the capitalization.] (_Heads.._)

TNW&gt;  Why did I go?
TNW&gt;  Why did I go? (_Hello_Earth_)

[...to the affair the other evening, which prompted me to flee in
near terror, and embark upon this journey that has landed me in the
water? -- Yeah, okay, maybe I've gone entirely too far this time.] 
(_Heads.._)

TNW&gt;  Tiefer, tiefer,
TNW&gt;  Irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht... (_Hello_Earth_)
 
[German!] (_Heads.._)

TNW&gt;  _The_Morning_Fog_

  _The_Fog_

[Very subtle similarity in titles.]
[And of course:]

TNW&gt;  They take me deeper and deeper. (_And_Dream_Of_Sheep_)
TNW&gt;  Under the ice, (_Under_Ice_)
TNW&gt;  "... Go down" (_Waking_The_Witch_)
TNW&gt;  ... there's a stone around my leg (_Waking_The_Witch_)
TNW&gt;  Tiefer, tiefer, irgendwo in der Tiefe.. (_Hello_Earth_)
      [Deeper, deeper, somewhere in the deep..]
TNW&gt;  I am falling (_The_Morning_Fog_)

  Going deep South, go down.. (_The_Sensual_World_)
  It lay buried here, it lay deep inside me. (_Love_And_Anger_)
  It's so deep.. (_Love_And_Anger_)
  Well, if it's so deep.. (_Love_And_Anger_)
  _Deeper_Understanding_
  

For what it's worth, enjoy!  (Don't fret, this is my last lengthy
post for a while...) In all seriousness, I _am_ looking
forward to hearing others' opinions on the _WYWM_ message.
