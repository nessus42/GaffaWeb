This is my first posting to the news, so forgive me if i seem to go on a
bit.
I don't usually have the ability to send mail off-campus so i want to make
the most of this chance.

The main reason I am posting is that I was lucky enough to get a chance to
see Jane Siberry in concert last night, at Moles nightclub in Bath, England
Having never heard any of her songs before I wasn't quite sure what to
expect but I'm happy to say that I was very impressed. Impressed enough to
ask her manager if I could do an interview after the show.

Not to my surprise he said no, she was too busy, having to rush off to
Brighton straight away, but then to my great surprise he gave me a
telephone number and told me that i could do a phone interview with her if
I wanted. After a bit more of a chat he then said that if I could make it
to one of her shows in London during this week he would guarantee me an
interview. Of course, I said I'd be there.

Now comes my problem, I don't have a clue what to ask. I have never heard
any of her music apart from last night, and hopefully the new album which I
bought today (I'm praying somebody will record it for me - my CD's bust)
So I thought I'd turn to this group for help, after all I only went to the
show in the first place because of your enthusiasm. So tell me, what do you
want to know ?

I need a lot of questions and a lot of background information AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE , by Friday at the latest. Please send me any information you have
about her work, previous interviews, reviews, questions etc.

I'm counting on this group to help prevent me from wasting a great
opportunity and from showing myself up completely.

I'll try to post a review of the London gig to the news, hopefully I'll be
able to get mail out, and of course, a transcript of the interview.
I haven't got time to review last night's show properly, but I'll jus say a
few words:-

Jane didn't get off to a great start, after 2-3 songs quite a few of the
200-odd audience were beginning to wonder why they'd came. Myself included.
I moved from my place right at the front, beside the stage back towards the
bar. However her fourth song was a definite improvement, I think she
realised that the crowd didn't know what to expect and were hoping for
something a little faster and 'heavier'. I don't know the name of the song,
but it included the word 'fucking' quite a bit, which seemed to bring the
crowd onto her side a bit more. (Does she swear on the records ?) At that point the atmosphere began to improve, the crowd were getting more interested in what she had to say, and people began pushing forwards again.

Her rendition of 'Everything reminds me of my dog' went down very well and
from then on the concert really took off. I managed to get back to about
the third row, but it was difficult to do, the audience were quite into
this by then.

Sorry I can't be more detailed about the songs, but I don't know any of
them!

A few other points, Jane complained that she couldn't hear herself on the
monitors, and also that she sounded a bit dull. After the gig, she told me
"It's hell out there !" (Did I forget to mention I talked to her ?)
A fair comment, it wasn't exactly her kind of audience.

When I did talk to her for a minute (thanks to her manager - a great bloke)
she seemed just as confused as I was, which was very lucky for me.

Anyway, I've said enough (or more than enough) so I'll finish now.

Please send me anything that may be of any interest or use to me

P.S. I'm going to the show on either Friday or Saturday, please hurry with
replies, direct to me if possible. Re-hashes of r.m.g. articles will also
be useful, since i tended to skip these at the time.   :-(
