_The Gavin Report_ is a trade magazine for the radio industry.  Thus,
it only includes airplay charts, not sales charts.  They missed a week
because of the earthquake (it's published in San Francisco), but the new
issue just came out.  There's lots of Kate in it.

First of all, "Love And Anger", which entered the Album Tracks chart at
#50 in the last issue, has now moved up to #32.  The same song debuts
on the Alternative Tracks chart at #28.

There's a column called "Biofeedback" in which tidbits of information
about hot artists are printed.  It says:

"When Kate was sixteen she already had a four octave vocal range.  Her
first demo tape, made while still a teenager, was sponsored by Pink
Floyd's David Gilmour."

There's a full page ad for the album -- almost identical to the one in
_Billboard_.

Best of all, there's a nice review of the album:

THE SENSUAL WORLD -- KATE BUSH
(COLUMBIA)

The first lady of progressive musical thought returns after her longest
absence.  Kate Bush's Sensual World is divided into three basic ethnic
camps.  The first is her usual extraordinary blend of eccentric 
electronics; the second is the Irish sessions cut in Dublin; the third
is the utilization of the Trio Bulgarka, who record ethnic Bulgarian
folk on Joe Boyd's respected Hannibal label.  Some familiar ground is
rediscovered, i.e. a trip back to childhood in relation to complex
adulthood on "The Fog."  But new fantasies are concocted.  "Heads We're
Dancing" is a dreamlike trip back to 1939 Germany at a party with young
Adolf Hitler (where does this woman get her inspiration?).  Most 
fascinating is "Deeper Understanding," a techno think piece on the home
computer being the next logical step after over-the-phone sex.  The
collisions between man and woman are explored on the title track,
"Between A Man And A Woman" and "This Woman's Work."  Guest cameos 
include guitarist David Gilmour, bassist Eberhard Weber, bassist Mick
Karn and members of the Bush clan on various levels of creative support.
In keeping with her usual high standards, The Sensual World is first rate
whether it's modern high tech record making or James Joycean roots.  Plus
there's plenty of mystique between the lines, something sorely missing
from much of the recent releases.


Later, this reviewer gives a quite favorable review of Laurie Anderson's
new album, _Strange Angels_.  At the end of this, he says, "Alongside
Kate Bush, this has been a phenomenal week for digital women."


Ed (Edward Suranyi)        |     "Bush is an acquired taste worth
Dept. of Applied Science   |              cultivating."
