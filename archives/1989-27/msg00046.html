NThis is a posting for a friend with no net access. All replies
Nby e-mail to him please.
N
NMessage from ee8kh@gdt.bath.ac.uk follows... (ee8kh@uk.ac.bath.gdt in UK)
N---
NThis is my first posting to the news, so forgive me if i seem to go on a
Nbit.
NI don't usually have the ability to send mail off-campus so i want to make
Nthe most of this chance.
N
NThe main reason I am posting is that I was lucky enough to get a chance to
Nsee Jane Siberry in concert last night, at Moles nightclub in Bath, England
NHaving never heard any of her songs before I wasn't quite sure what to
Nexpect but I'm happy to say that I was very impressed. Impressed enough to
Nask her manager if I could do an interview after the show.
N
NNot to my surprise he said no, she was too busy, having to rush off to
NBrighton straight away, but then to my great surprise he gave me a
Ntelephone number and told me that i could do a phone interview with her if
NI wanted. After a bit more of a chat he then said that if I could make it
Nto one of her shows in London during this week he would guarantee me an
Ninterview. Of course, I said I'd be there.
N
NNow comes my problem, I don't have a clue what to ask. I have never heard
Nany of her music apart from last night, and hopefully the new album which I
Nbought today (I'm praying somebody will record it for me - my CD's bust)
NSo I thought I'd turn to this group for help, after all I only went to the
Nshow in the first place because of your enthusiasm. So tell me, what do you
Nwant to know ?
N
NI need a lot of questions and a lot of background information AS SOON AS
NPOSSIBLE , by Friday at the latest. Please send me any information you have
Nabout her work, previous interviews, reviews, questions etc.
N
NI'm counting on this group to help prevent me from wasting a great
Nopportunity and from showing myself up completely.
N
NI'll try to post a review of the London gig to the news, hopefully I'll be
Nable to get mail out, and of course, a transcript of the interview.
NI haven't got time to review last night's show properly, but I'll jus say a
Nfew words:-
N
NJane didn't get off to a great start, after 2-3 songs quite a few of the
N200-odd audience were beginning to wonder why they'd came. Myself included.
NI moved from my place right at the front, beside the stage back towards the
Nbar. However her fourth song was a definite improvement, I think she
Nrealised that the crowd didn't know what to expect and were hoping for
Nsomething a little faster and 'heavier'. I don't know the name of the song,
Nbut it included the word 'fucking' quite a bit, which seemed to bring the
Ncrowd onto her side a bit more. (Does she swear on the records ?) At that point the atmosphere began to improve, the crowd were getting more interested in what she had to say, and people began pushing forwards again.
N
NHer rendition of 'Everything reminds me of my dog' went down very well and
Nfrom then on the concert really took off. I managed to get back to about
Nthe third row, but it was difficult to do, the audience were quite into
Nthis by then.
N
NSorry I can't be more detailed about the songs, but I don't know any of
Nthem!
N
NA few other points, Jane complained that she couldn't hear herself on the
Nmonitors, and also that she sounded a bit dull. After the gig, she told me
N"It's hell out there !" (Did I forget to mention I talked to her ?)
NA fair comment, it wasn't exactly her kind of audience.
N
NWhen I did talk to her for a minute (thanks to her manager - a great bloke)
Nshe seemed just as confused as I was, which was very lucky for me.
N
NAnyway, I've said enough (or more than enough) so I'll finish now.
N
NPlease send me anything that may be of any interest or use to me

N
NP.S. I'm going to the show on either Friday or Saturday, please hurry with
Nreplies, direct to me if possible. Re-hashes of r.m.g. articles will also
Nbe useful, since i tended to skip these at the time.   :-(
