I read Karen's letter, then Richard Bensam's reply.  I don't think Richard is 
aware, from what he says, about the hassle surrounding the release of The 
Dreaming.  I recall some lovely posters round London, where I was living at the 
time, but there was virtually no airplay and EMI seemed to be of the opinion 
that since they didn't like it, they wouldn't promote it.  I think I am right in
saying thKate had to mount a personal promotion campaign, this meant her 
appearing in strange places where she would generally be found : a BBC Radio 2 
(easy listening, for those outside of the UK) interview and phone-in, an 
appearance on a couple of childrens' TV programmes - I remember her doing "There
Goes A Tenner" on a show called Razmatazz, and she was interviewed on another 
talking about Sat In Your Lap - don't remember the name of the show, but Kate 
looked out of place and the kids obviously weren't on her wavelength.  EMI 
treated Kate appallingly over that album, I think they thought they had a sugary
kid who looked good and sang weirdenough songs, but with pretty enough tunes, to
sell; when she started doing things her way and came out with an album as 
powerful and individual as TD, they couldn't handle it, or her.

If this is what TAFKAS admires, then I'm with him.  Kate has shown she won't 
compromise her integrity to please a few string pulling bozos at a record 
company, and good for her.
