 Subject: Gary Numan (very long, sorry)

     Someone asked for a Gary Numan discography. IED regrets that he cannot
give catalog numbers, but he can offer a checklist of the titles and LP
affiliations of virtually all of Numan's tracks. The Numan catalogue is well
(but by no means completely) represented on compact disk. Most of
his albums have been released in CD form, but in order to maximize
the increased capacity of the digital medium and minimize the number
of Numan CD products on the market, his labels (or he?), Beggar's
Banquet and Numa (a now-defunct self-designed label under the Beggar's
Banquet umbrella) put two of his old LPs on each CD. Unfortunately
this required lopping off a few tracks along the way.
     In addition, Numan's b-sides--which are exceptionally numerous--
are also mostly unavailable on disk. And a small collection of early
demos, as well as a large number of live recordings, have yet to be
put out on CD.
     Here is IED's list of all the Numan tracks he knows of:

     Early (Tubeway Army) tracks that _are_ available on CD
include the two albums, _Tubeway_Army_ (Numan's first album), and
_The_Plan_, a collection of other early tracks which actually was
released years afterward. Both these albums, really Numan's first
and second, are listed here:

 Listen to the Sirens
 My Shadow in Vain
 The Life Machine
 Friends
 Something in the House
 Every Day I Die
 Steel and You
 My Love is a Liquid
 Are You Real?
 The Dream Police
 Jo the Waiter
 Zero Bars (Mr. Smith)
 This is My Life
 Critics
 Ice
 Mean Street
 Thoughts #2
 Basic J.
 Check It
 The Monday Troop
 Crime of Passion
 That's Too Bad

     But the following early (Tubeway Army) tracks, which were released
on a series of three color-vinyl EPs a few years ago, are still not on
CD:

 Fadeout 1930
 Oh! Didn't I Say?
 Blue Eyes
 O.D. Receiver
 Bombers (demo)
 Something's In the House (demo)
 Friends (demo)
 Steel and You (demo)
 My Shadow in Vain (demo)
 The Life Machine (demo)

     Numan's third album, _Replicas_, is available on CD with no
tracks missing. Most of the b-sides that belong with it are not out
on CD, however. Here are all the _Replicas_ session tracks on CD so far:

 Me, I Disconnect From You
 Are 'Friends' Electric?
 The Machmen
 Praying to the Aliens
 Down in the Park
 You Are in My Vision
 Replicas
 It Must Have Been You
 When Machines Rock
 I Nearly Married a Human
 We Are So Fragile
 Do You Need the Service?

     These tracks, from the same sessions, are _not_ yet out on CD:

 Down in the Park (Piano)
 I Nearly Married a Human (2)
 The Crazies
 Only a Downstat

     Numan's fourth album, the first to be credited to him as a solo
artist rather than to Tubeway Army, was called _The_Pleasure_Principle_.
All of it is available, as well, but not all the tracks from the
_Pleasure_Principle_ sessions. These tracks are on CD:

 Airlane
 Metal
 Complex
 Films
 M.E.
 Tracks
 Observer
 Cars
 Conversation

     These two tracks from the same sessions are _not_ yet out on CD:

 Asylum
 Oceans

    However, a recent re-mix of a track from _The_Pleasure_Principle_
has appeared on CD:

 Cars ("E Reg Model" re-mix)

     The fifth album, _Telekon_, is available in its entirety on disk:

 This Wreckage
 The Aircrash Bureau
 Telekon
 Remind Me To Smile
 I Sleep by Windows
 I'm an Agent
 I Dream of Wires
 Remember I Was Vapour
 Please Push No More
 The Joy Circuit
 We Are Glass
 I Die: You Die
 Photograph
 On Broadway (live)
 A Game Called Echo

     The _Telekon_-sessions b-side of Satie's Premiere Gymnopedie (the
same piece, incidentally, that Kate Bush had earlier arranged as framing music
for her live/TV performances of _Symphony_in_Blue_), is not yet on CD.
     On the other hand, Numan's three collaborations with Robert Palmer,
the tracks _I_Dream_of_Wires_ (arguably more beautiful than Numan's
solo version of the song) and the Numan/Palmer track _Style_Kills_ and
_Found_You_Now_, are available on various Palmer CDs.

     All but two of the album tracks from Numan's sixth LP, _Dance_,
are now out on CD:

 Slowcar to China
 Night Talk
 A Subway Called "You"
 She's Got Claws
 Crash
 Stories
 My Brother's Time
 You Are, You Are (We Are Glass 2)
 Moral (Metal 2)
 Stormtrooper in Drag (non-LP track)

     These tracks from the _Dance_ sessions are still unavailable on CD:

 Cry, the Clock Said
 Listen, Zara
 I Sing Rain
 Exhibition

     The seventh album was _I,_Assassin_. It's out on CD completely:

 White Boys and Heroes
 War Songs
 A Dream of Siam
 Music for Chameleons
 This is My House
 I, Assassin
 The 1930s Rust
 We Take Mystery (to Bed)
 Noise Noise
 Love Needs No Disguise

     These _I,_Assassin_-era non-LP tracks are _not_ yet out on CD:

 We Take Mystery (Early Version)
 The Image Is
 Face to Face
 Bridge? What Bridge?
 War Games
 Glitter and Ash
 White Boys and Heroes (alternate mix)
 We Take Mystery (To Bed) (alternate mix)

     The eighth album, _Warriors_, is available in its entirety on CD:

 Warriors
 I Am Render
 The Iceman Comes
 This Prison Moon
 My Centurion
 Sister Surprise
 The Tick Tock Man
 Love is Like Clock Law
 The Rhythm of the Evening

     These _Warriors_ b-sides are not yet on CD, however:

 My Car Slides (1)
 My Car Slides (2)
 Poetry and Power
 Letters

     The ninth album was _Berserker_. Disgracefully, this album is
still not available on CD, except for these two tracks:

 My Dying Machine (only as a CD-only re-mix on the U.S. _New_Anger_ CD)
 Child With the Ghost (also on the U.S. _New_Anger_ CD)

     All the other _Berserker_-session tracks, including its b-sides,
are still unavailable on CD:

 Berserker
 Berserker (extended mix)
 This is New Love
 The Secret
 My Dying Machine (original mix)
 Cold Warning
 Pump It Up
 The God Film
 The Hunter
 Empty Bed, Empty Heart
 Here Am I
 She Cries
 The Picture

     And naturally Caroline Munro's twelve-inch, from the same sessions,
is unavailable on CD:

 Pump Me Up (really just a re-mix of the LP track, produced by Numan)

     _The_Fury_, the tenth album, is out as a CD by itself:

 Call Out the Dogs
 This Disease
 Your Fascination
 Miracles
 The Pleasure Skin
 Creatures
 Tricks
 God Only Knows
 I Still Remember

     However, none of _The_Fury_'s twelve-inch tracks are on CD yet:

 No Shelter
 This Ship Comes Apart
 We Need It
 The Fear
 Anthem
 Puppets
 Your Fascination (extended re-mix)
 Call Out the Dogs (extended re-mix)

     Album number 11 was _Strange_Charm_. It is available in its
entirety:

 My Breathing
 Unknown and Hostile
 The Sleeproom
 New Thing From London Town
 I Can't Stop
 Strange Charm
 The Need
 This Is Love

     But _Strange_Charm_'s non-LP tracks are not on CD:

 New Thing From London Town (extended re-mix)
 I Can't Stop (extended re-mix)
 Rumour
 Survival (studio version)

     And one other track from _Strange_Charm_ is available in a live
version only:

 Survival (on _The_Skin_Mechanic_, see below)

     Some other tracks from this period came out under the group name
Radio Heart (a group created by Numan, to whose singles and sole album
he contributed a few lead vocals). These are out on a CD-single:

 All Across the Nation (extended mix)
 All Across the Nation (radio mix)
 All Across the Nation (instrumental mix)
 River

     But one more Numan track from those sessions is still not out:

 Rumour

     Numan's work with Bill Sharpe also dates from about this period,
and two singles plus an album (Numan's twelfth), _Automatic_, have all
come out on CD under the group name Sharpe/Numan:

 Change Your Mind
 Turn Off the World
 No More Lies
 No More Lies (extended re-mix)
 No More Lies ('89 mix)
 Breathe in Emotion
 Some New Game
 I'm On Automatic
 I'm On Automatic (twelve-inch mix)
 Rip It Up
 Welcome to Love
 Voices
 Voices ('89 remix)
 Nightlife
 Love Like a Ghost

     The latest and thirteenth Gary Numan album is _New_Anger_.
The UK edition is the only complete version of the album. (The U.S.
CD is missing two tracks, which have been replaced with two tracks
from _Berserker_.) Here are the CD tracks:

 This is Emotion
 Hunger
 New Anger
 America
 Voix
 Respect
 Young Heart
 Cold Metal Rhythm
 Don't Call My Name
 I Don't Believe

     One _New_Anger_ track is not on CD, so far as IED is aware:

 Children

     There have been a lot of official Numan live recordings--four
(count 'em) two-LP sets documenting four of Numan's many huge tours.
Of these, only the latest, the New Anger Tour, is available on CD,
although a few isolated earlier live tracks have appeared on CD-singles.
The live CD is called _The_Skin_Mechanic_:

 Survival
 Respect
 Call Out the Dogs
 Cars
 Hunger
 Down in the Park
 New Anger
 Creatures
 Are 'Friends' Electric?
 Young Heart
 We Are Glass
 I Die: You Die
 I Can't Stop

     There is only one non-studio-LP track in all of Numan's live
output to date, and it is not on CD:

 Ghost

     All of Numan's other live recordings, too numerous to mention
here, are unavailable on CD.
     Warning: Do not take the listings above to indicate that all
the album tracks said to be "available on CD" can be found on the
CD-album with the title in question. Most of the CD albums are
missing a couple of tracks, and some (but not all) of those missing
tracks may be found on the two-CD set called _Exhibition_.
     To conclude: A total of 152 Gary Numan tracks (including 14 live)
are on CD. But there are still 61 Gary Numan studio recordings _not_
yet available on CD.
     Finally, Numan produced a number of records for other "artists"
along with his group of cronies under the production name The Wave Team.
These were all released by Numan's late vanity label Numa Records.
The artists included Steve Bauer, the group Hohokam, the actress
Caroline Munro and Numan's own brother John Webb. Naturally, none
of these people's recordings ever made it to CD.

   p.s.: disKlaimer--The eKsTreme length of the above posting about a
musician who has virtually no conneKTion with the subjeKT of
Kate Bushology should not be construed as an indiKaTion that IED
has lost his perspeKTive...
