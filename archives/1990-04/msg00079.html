Vickie here.


In article &lt;9001220907.AA17048@world.std.com&gt; you write:
&gt; [ good stuff]
&gt;... Regretting What I Said which skewers men who find it difficult to tell the
&gt;truth ...
&gt; [ more good stuff ]

huh? I thought it was about "what a woman in love can do" to a lover who runs
off on short notice to go skiing. are you interpreting it differently, or
thinking of another song, or am I completely confused?

Derek
--------------------bounced e-mail reply-----------------------------
 Derek, that was Ladyslipper's mistake, not mine. Regretting What I
Said is about a woman who regrets (not too much though) what all she
said to her boyfriend after she finds out that he's going to go to Switzerland (right?) to ski without her. It's very sick and funny.
You're not confused. Ladyslipper was, though I didn't catch it before
printing it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's another of Christine's songs:
This isn't a duet, she sings everything

             Camping

Oh I'm in love with a man who loves to camp
he camps when it's sunny, he camps when it's damp
All he needs is a tent, a sleeping roll
a pack of Jahotas [not sure about that word, can't make it out]
and a sack of charcoal
he camps in the desert, he camps in the snow
he says "Baby come with me"
I say "no"
You see, I like hot showers and I like ice,
the cool cotton sheets on my bed feel so nice
I'm afraid of little animals and scared of big bites
I like the feel of bare feet on a bare Bear rug
I can't stand Port-O-Sans or community soap
I say "Baby stay with me"
he says "no"
So I say "Why deprive yourself of the creature comforts
it's taken man so long to invent?"
And he said something about Walden, throwing back to Woodstock,
livin' his life in a tent and then he went "ooooooooooooooooh"
Oh I can picture him now by a babbling brook, 
slappin' at mosquitos, slippin' bait on a hook
I can see the bears sniffin' round for something to steal
Oh bears, get the hot dogs, don't make my baby your meal
This whole scenerio it give me such a fright,
to think, he could have stayed with me tonight
Well my air-conditioner makes a real cool breeze
not unlike the wind, whistlin' through the trees
I got stars on my ceiling (glow in the dark!)
I'll open up the windows, we can hear the birds in the park
I'll put "Wild Kingdom" on my TV
This might not be camping but it's pretty close
honey, I'm not a primitive as you want me to be
This might not be camping but it's close enough for me!
-----------------------
Here's another:
This song is acappella with only a clock ticking and some backing vocals

      Biological Time Bomb

Listen girls, do you hear something ticking?
(i do i do i do i do i do)
It's inside me it's inside you-a biological time bomb
Oh you can barely hear it when you're twenty
but when you're thirty, it's plenty louder
Your mother warned you, but no, you had to doubt her
"I've got plenty of time, mom"
Oh (oh oh) the ticking echos in that empty womb
Oh (oh oh) from the next apartment, did you hear that BOOM?
Her biological time bomb.
Now every time you see a baby carriage
you curse the years you have avoided marriage
You are angry, you are confused
But wait! I have figured out how to diffuse the 
biological time bomb
First you have a dozen of your eggs aspirated
frozen in the freezer of you doctor's fridgerator
In ten or twenty or thirty years, whenever you wish
you thaw them out to romance wigglys in a petri dish
then plant the little goober in a girl of seventeen
who's into natural living and Prevention magazine
No fuss no muss no stretch marks (well not on you)
Maternal instincts satisfied, the modern thing to do.
Listen girls, you can't ignore that ticking any longer
as you grow older, it will grow stronger
Biological Time Bomb
Biological Time Bomb
Biological......(tick tick tick tick tick...)
-----------------

Wonderful! Her voice, the way she phrases things and the background
sound effects all add interesting things to all the songs.

Woj, I don't know anything about that radio show you heard. I've
never seen or heard Christine live.
