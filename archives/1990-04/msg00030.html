A friend of mine is trying to put together the 3rd or 4th (I
forget...) net.music tape.  Here is his announcement.  Get your tape
recorder goin'!

Subject: Another call for reader's tapes for the June compilation
Distribution: world
Organization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Hello again,

	As the Nineties slowly but firmly pry their way up from under
the winter soil and the Age of PostModernism yields its ground to the
PostBatman Era (or, for those with shorter agendae, Groundhog Day), I
post again with dismay that in the past month I have received entirely
ONE tape for the 1990 network readers' compilation to be released at
cost in June.

	I have received several mailings expressing concern over
production quality, musical genres, copyrights and other legalities,
and one tape.  I would like to encourage those of you besides Ken
Field who wrote to me to take the lead from the last (1987) release,
which contained many two-track bedroom recordings which were
nonetheless well-received, a surprising lack of coherence which
abrogated any sort of network pecking order, and a complete lack of
legal complications (Neil Young never did sue me for covering his
stuff badly, and if you think your songs are more stealable than
Valerie's was, well...).  The ubiquitous byword is still Bill Murray's
"It Doesn't Really Matter," with the local rider "under five minutes
would be nice".

	I encourage and will shortly implore you to dust off the tape
recorder, borrow a friend's, or pay for some small studio time.  I
made an earlier quip about sending me your latest CD which apparently
was taken too seriously.  I tend to forget or overlook in my haste to
get back to work that the posted word appears much more literal than
the spoken one, especially in my case.  Msrs. Porta 05 and X15 are
both welcome at this year's banquet; hors d'oeuves are complimentary.
	
	The only difficult requirement is fitting my address on a
padded envelope:

	Paul Boutin
	Educational Initiatives
	Project Athena
	Massachusetts Institute of Technology
	One Amherst Street
	E40-300
	Cambridge, MA 02139

	You don't have to sound like Pailhead or the Connection
Machine, or even yourself, just something of yours you'd like the rest
of us to hear.  Thank you.  Bust da move.
