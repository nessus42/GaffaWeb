RUTH did make it into MTV's medium rotation around October of 1985 and
there was one weekend that Cloudbusting got played every 4 hours or so
somewhere in January of 86.  120 minutes started showing around March
and they played Experiment IV when it came out, but I had stopped
watching MTV's regular playlist long before then.
I do remember in March '83 when they were running their 'guest VJ' on a
monthly basis, they put on some guys from Duran Duran who played SIYL
which left me speechless. They repeated that guest vj hour in '85 so I
got to hear SIYL again and log KT's name down in the 'find out more
about this artist' category.

Actually MTV never was the place to look for KT. USA's Night Flight
sometimes showed a KT concert (I think it was only stuff from TKI) and
they had KT videos playing.

Bout 2 weeks ago I turned on MTV to see them advertising new bands
playing, 2 of which were KT and Depeche Mode. its just incredible how
low they've sunk.
