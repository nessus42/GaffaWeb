&gt;From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
&gt;     Meredith's inquiry about the MTV Rockumentary requires IED
&gt;to discourage all U.S. Love-Hounds from hoping that the programme will
&gt;ever appear on American MTV.
&gt;     Therefore, IED implores all European-based and English-based
&gt;Love-Hounds to tape the programme for the benefit of us less
&gt;fortunate ones in America. Perhaps, if it contains new interview

I should perhaps point out that few people in the UK subscribe to
either cable or satellite and therefore do not get MTV. So don't
hold your breath waiting for a transcription. Maybe more common on
the continent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;MARY COUGHLIN-Tired &amp; Emotional
&gt;&gt;It's good to hear someone promoting Mary Coughlin. I strongly urge
&gt;&gt;Love-hounds to check her out. Great for late night listening. There
&gt;&gt;is a second album called "Under the Influence" which includes a great
&gt;&gt;version of "Ride On". Both albums highly recommended. Both are also
&gt;&gt;available on CD - at least over here. It has been a long time since
&gt;&gt;the second album came out so maybe there is another one due.
&gt;
&gt;I can't let this go by. Neil, you ruined my day. You know that don't
&gt;you? MARY HAS A SECOND ALBUM?????? I had no idea. I'm even more upset
&gt;to know that it's been out for quite a while and I didn't know. I
&gt;guess it hasn't been released in the US.

Well if I tell you that a third album should be out about March time
will that make you feel better or worse?

&gt;I......almost.....gave a tape to Katarina Witt, my all-time favorite
&gt;female skater (B. Orser's my favorite guy too), but I chickened out
&gt;again. Cluck, cluck.

Yea, KaTarina is great. What has happened to women skaters though - in the
European championships last week all the top four female skaters
fell during their free programme. Come to think of it so did a number
of the top pairs skaters. And why do the Duchenays (sp?) get such
lousey marks while the Russians do the same old dance routines they
have been doing for the last 10 years and pick up near maximums?

&gt;katefans@world.std.com is the only address we have. We seem to get
&gt;mail OK, but have had a VERY hard time sending mail. So many letters
&gt;have bounced and we can't figure out why.
&gt;Neil, our letter to you bounced.

What network are you connected to? What address did you try. I will
try sending you mail.

Anyone got confirmation about another UK single

Be seeing you,
Neil.
