&gt;I bought two Peter Gabriel bootlegs yesterday, Intruder and Without
&gt;Frontiers, and was surprised to see (hear?) that Kate was present on two
&gt;of the songs from Without Frontiers:  Angel Gabriel and Just Another Day.

My very strong suspicion is that those two tunes come from the December 1979 
"Kate" special on British TV, which circulates as a kind of sub-bootleg video.  
The "Angel Gabriel" is a short a capella introduction to Peter Gabriel's solo 
performance of "Here Comes the Flood" on that show, and then later in the show 
Peter and Kate do the Roy Harper song "Another Day" in a kind of concept video 
interpretation, where the separation scene is played out as a kind of 
fantasy/reverie for the two sitting empty and detached at a small table 
together.  Love-Hounds who like Cocteau Twins should check out Elizabeth 
Frazer's version of the same song on the various-artists' collaboration disk, 
"This Mortal Coil" (Beggar's Banquet Music CAD 411 CD, no date--anybody know?).

&gt;Happily, these two songs had the best technical quality of any on the album,
&gt;although unhappily they were both clipped a bit at the beginning and the
&gt;end, and I didn't think that they were such great songs in the first place.
&gt;(Kate's voice is so high that she sounds like she's on helium.)

As to Kate's voice, this was 1979, the year of "O England, My Lionheart" and the 
Tour of Life.  It wasn't helium; it was pure chops.

If the technical quality on Sharon's bootlegs seems comparatively good, however, 
then either that is exciting (because my tape of the "Kate" show is lamentable 
audio), or it is a bad sign (because if her sound is the same as mine, then the 
REST of her Gabriel bootleg is dismal indeed).

I do agree that neither of these pieces "were such great songs in the first 
place," and kb completists should probably hold out for the video of the "Kate" 
show--UNLESS a good audio track for the two singings has become available now 
for the first time.
