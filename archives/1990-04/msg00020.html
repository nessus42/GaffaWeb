Hi folks, I don't remember if anyone posted this but I figgured all of
the fellow love-hounds would like to know what what is in the "official
press-kit" Here is the scoop:

There is a 2 page press release which I have included. A 8x10 black &amp;
white glossy of Kate's head. It looks like a shot from the Sensual
World single cover sessions. The picture is of her looking up and to
the left, it shows a semi-profile where the right side of her face is
almost all washed out white.

So, if you want to compare the following with the so-called articles in
the magazines, read on:


                              Eclectic Music

CBS Press Release                                           Posted January 1990

The following text is directly from a CBS Press Release 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                _KATE BUSH_

    THE SENSUAL WORLD, the sixth studio album from Kate Bush, features ten
new compositions by the artist (eleven on compact disc and cassette). The
new LP was produced by Kate, recorded by Del Palmer, and mixed by Kevin
Killen.

    THE SENSUAL WORLD was recorded mainly by Kate's studio in Kent, although
sessions also took place in Dublin and at EMI's Abbey Road complex. Kate
plays piano and keyboards and is augmented by a host of acclaimed musicians.
These include Bulgaria's Trio Bulgarka, whose unusual voices are heard on
three songs: "Deeper Understanding," Never Be Mine," and "Rocket's Tail."
There is also the haunting sound of Davey Spillane's Uillean pipes on the
title-tune (and first U.K. single), "The Sensual Word," inspired by the
James Joyce masterpiece, _Ulysses_.

    Kate Bush was born in Bexley, Kent, England, on July 30, 1958. Her
father, an avid spare time piano player, and mother, an Irish woman who
takes much joy in music and dancing, raised Kate and her two older brothers
with an open mind to artistic experiments.

    Kate began violin lessons (reluctantly) around the age of nine but took
a passionate interest in the piano. The day after her father showed her the
scale of C, Kate became a songwriter.

    As a result of a three-track demo, organized and financed by Pink
Floyd's Dave Gilmour, Kate was signed to EMI before leaving school.
Accepting a modest advance from EMI, she was able to concentrate full time
on her dance studies, which were initially inspired, and later taught, by
theatrical mime-master Lindsay Kemp. They would prove invaluable later on
with the dawning of the age of video.

    "I'd wanted to make a record more than anything else," Kate remembers.
Her ambition was achieved in mid-1977 with the recording of her debut album,
_The Kick Inside_. Her first single, "Wuthering Heights," became a #1
single in the U.K.  (January, 1978). It was followed by the album, which
rapidly sold over one million copies in the U.K. alone.

    The pressure was on to make and release a second album. But when Kate
realized her recording schedule has to be fitted around promotional demands
all over the continent, she vowed to exercise much more control over her
career in the future. Nonetheless, the _Lionheart_ album came out in
December '78 and a decision to tour was finalized.

    Thirty odd dates took place in Britain and Europe during the spring '79.
Every show was a sellout and the two and a half hours of music, dance, mime,
and magic defied critics' expectations. But the rigors exhausted Kate to
such an extent she's never been able seriously contemplate the idea of
another tour.

    The _Kate Bush on Stage (Live EP)_ was released September , 1979. This
was the first co-production between Kate and John Kelly (who'd engineered
the first two albums).

    Then came the five and a half minute single, "Breathing," which
championed Green issues back in 1980, and marked a major change in the
expectations of Kate Bush's many observers. The single entitled "Babooshka"
(June, 1980) was followed in September by a new album, _Never For Ever_.
Here was a vinyl confirmation that Kate had much to offer for the often
bland world of pop.

    "_The Dreaming_ album was so difficult to make," says Kate of her next
record (released September, 1982). "Just about everything that could go
wrong _did_ during that period." With studio problems and her method of
working the cost involved, she decided to upgrade her own demo studio into
a professional recording level.

    Meanwhile, critics were left to ponder the merits of an album that had
yielded "Sat in Your Lap" and the title track as singles. In fact, _The
Dreaming_ added considerably to the Kate Bush fan base between it's release
and that of _Hounds of Love_ exactly three years later. As with _The
Dreaming_, Kate produced _Hounds of Love_, Del Palmer engineered and, for
the first time, they could boast of an album recorded in their own studio.

    _Hounds of Love_ quickly established itself as Kate's most successful
album to date both in a commercial and critical sense. It was the first to
give her real chart success in America, hitting the top 30 in 1985 (as did
the "Running Up That Hill" single). The album was also the catalyst for
several superb videos, most memorably the one that accompanied
"Cloudbusting," which starred Kate and Donald Sutherland -- one of her
favorite actors.

    _The Whole Story_ came next, the million-selling compilation album and
video released late in 1986. Both formats charted high amongst the best-
selling titles that year. Kate's videos, many of which are directed by her,
are almost as popular as her records.

    "I know it's taken a long time but each record gets harder to make," she
says, explaining the four-year gap between the albums, _Hounds of Love_ and
_THE SENSUAL WORLD_, the latter released worldwide on October 17, 1989.
"This is my most personal and female album so far. I particularly wanted
"The Sensual World" as the first single because I feel it is a strong
expression of positive female energy."
