-&gt; Our cable company hooked up (and I started watching) MTV in 1981,
-&gt; when they were still playing their entire library on a daily basis.
-&gt; Being only 13, I watched it quite heavily....  I saw a lot of
-&gt; classics (the video for _Voices_ by Russ Ballard springs to mind,
-&gt; as well as that favorite, _Two_Triple_Cheese_ by Commander Cody),

Voices was a great tune and a great video, but I don't remember Two
Triple Cheese. Then again, I don't suppose many people remember
"Double Dutch Bus" or "Wot" either. :)

-&gt; but I don't recall *ever* seeing a KT video before L&amp;A.

Hmm. Maybe I was glued to the set more than most in late '85, but they
played the stupid version of RUTH quite often, and I saw the Donald
Sutherland video for Cloudbusting a few times, and I saw the Big Sky
once (I remember that, because one of my friends told me she was
smashed when she made that song or video, I forget which, and it was a
very rich-looking video for the time).

Speaking of Cloudbusting, ummm.... I remember someone telling me she
was working on a longform version of that video. Did anything ever
come of it, or do I have that confused with the ill-fated Ninth Wave
video project? (Wow, would that have changed my middle adolescence.)
