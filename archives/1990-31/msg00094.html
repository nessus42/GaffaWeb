&gt;Subject: Transcript of Kate's Participation in the Kate Bush Convention

First of all, many thanks to IED for transcribing this. I had forgotten
just how much Kate had said. When I was there the time just flew past.
Based on some of the things Kate said I would like to hypothesise on the
format of the new album and next tour.

&gt;   "Uh, and uh, I--I've kind of been taking the approach where
&gt;I go back to writing on the piano again, which was how I used
&gt;to work when I started. And, uh, it was quite shocking for me
&gt;to suddenly be left alone at the piano without all this
&gt;equipment, you know, where I could just press a button and
&gt;I've suddenly got an orchestra...And I felt really, uh, really
&gt;odd about the whole thing. But, uh, in some ways I think I'm
&gt;trying to get back to a lot of things that were my roots. Uh,
&gt;I've started dancing again, which I never thought I'd manage."

&gt;  (About one minute
&gt;is inaudible here, as IED fiddled with his camera and microphone.
&gt;Kate says the name of the person who wrote the question she had
&gt;set aside earlier, and this person then reads the question, which
&gt;is, basically, "Are you ever going to tour again?")

The question was something like "If you were ever going to tour again would
it be in small venues like last time or very big arenas"

&gt;   "Well, I have to say that, if circumstances allow--if things go
&gt;well--we are hoping very much to do some shows at the end of next year."

Both these extracts plus Ed's news that the next album is expected to
be complete by July 1991 and that the tour will be in support of it
indicate that we should expect a very different Kate album next time.
I would not be surprised if she produced a largely acoustic album
featuring many tracks with just piano. The only comparison that comes
to mind at the moment is Springstein's Nebraska album which was
extremely basic compared to his other albums. I cannot see any other
way that Kate will complete an album by the middle of next year
unless she is planning to reduce the production to a bare minimum.

If Kate did release a mellow, "simple" album then I would see the live
show being in two halves. The first half might be largely solo
performances of the new songs and some of the quieter tracks from the
past. It would feature Kate at the piano for much of the time. The
second half of the show would be the "rock" half and would feature
tracks from all her albums with a full band, backing singers etc. In
this section Kate would be dancing and doing costume changes. Such
a format would allow Kate to cover a wide range of material and it
would be much less exhausting than the Tour of Life. Kate has made it
clear that although she liked doing live dates, the previous tour
was too exhausting and it is hard to imagine her wanting to do repeat
the exercise.

Food for thought ...
