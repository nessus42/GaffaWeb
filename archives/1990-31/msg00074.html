&gt;From: nv89-pyl@nada.kth.se (Patrik Yle'n)
&gt;
&gt;Are you aware that the US and England have different TV-standards?
&gt;In the UK you have PAL, and in the US NTSC....
&gt;Which means you won`t be able to play US tapes in a UK VCR.

No longer strictly true. You can now get VHS video recorders in the UK
which will play back NTSC tapes as well as PAL tapes. In fact I have
just splashed out on the Panasonic NVJ35B which is one such beast (not that
I bought it for that feature). However, you also need a fairly modern
TV set which is able to co-operate with the conversion.

I did of course buy the video in order to watch the (signed) tape I won
at the Convention. Turned out to be a fairly expensive prize! But well
worth it (I wanted a video machine anyway). As Jorn has already described,
the tape contains the three promo videos for TSW plus interview footage
complete with running time. The whole thing had formed part of the
video collection (This Woman's Work) shown at the Convention.

As my tape said running time 76mins I thought we were going to get some
extra goodies. Turned out to be only 36 mins however. The flyer for the
official release which came when my ticket was delivered said it would be
45 mins. so whether that will turn out to be different is anyone's guess.

&gt;From: barger@aristotle.ils.nwu.edu (Jorn Barger)
&gt;Subject: More KateCon gossip
&gt;The duplication of "Walk Straight Down the Middle"
&gt;must have been due to carelessness and/or the economy of only
&gt;making one master tape for LP's and CD's (and cassettes, which I saw in
&gt;England but hadn't heard of before).

It must have been because they wanted all the sets to be the same. TSW
was the only Kate disc where the vinyl and CD versions differed in their
tracks. Hence, for those who had only the LPs "Walk Straight Down the
Middle" had to be included as part of the extra discs/records for the
sake of completness. Hence, duplication for the poor CD owners.

BTW,  apologies to Jorn Barger and Evan Welsh for misspelling their
names in my Convention report (also to anyone else who suffered the
same fate at my keyboard).

Be seeing you
	Neil
