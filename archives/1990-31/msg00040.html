&gt;There were a few (three?) live performances by Kate fans doing covers
&gt;of Kate songs.  Interesting but I think I prefer the originals :-)

Agreed.  One of the women who sang (the one with the programmable
synth backup) sounded a little Enya-ish, but didn't sing nearly as
well.  Very good, though - just not as good as Kate or Enya.

I thought that the six dancers were *very* good, though.  I'm not sure
about this, but were they wearing outfits from the _Running_up_that_
_Hill_ video? 

&gt;There was a video documentary (who put it together?  Peter Morris &amp;
&gt;the gang?)  It was, something like 1 to 1.5 hours long and contained
&gt;some commercially available videos, live TV performances, bits of TV
&gt;interviews, less easily available videos, etc.  It was shown in three
&gt;parts on a big video wall (the wall was of marginal quality.)  The
&gt;tape is not available for copying :-(

The video was *great*!  Some of the things that stick out from it for
me were:  Seeing Kate and Peter Gabriel sing Roy Harper's
_Another_Day_.  I'd heard it, but never seen it.  Very moving.  I hope
it gets released one of these days...  It was also interesting to
finally see what Ken of the GLC looked like.  Kind of made the song
make a lot more sense.

Speaking of unreleased songs, Kate also talked about how great it was
to record Elton John's _Rocket_Man_, as she had always been a fan of
his.  I don't think that it'll ever be released, as, according to
Kate, it's not up to her whether it will come out or not, but up to
the record company.

&gt;Pretty nice, huh?

I think that's putting it mildly.
