&gt;Subject: Convention video question
&gt;Somebody said that the video that they showed will never be sold.  Is that
&gt;something they said at the convention or a guess or what?  I (and I am sure
&gt;all the people who wern't at the con) would love to see it.

The video was put together by the Homeground team from Kate
video performances on various TV stations around the World. They said it
would be impossible to get permission to release all the bits on a
commercial video. They would have to go and ask TV stations around the
World to releae the copyright. Even if they had the resources to
do this, it would take years.

&gt;Subject: The Kate photographer's jinx
&gt;I've heard that Kate does not like being photographed.  Perhaps her
&gt;emotions in this regard are strong enough to affect cameras at a
&gt;distance! :-)  Here's what I've heard, so far:

&lt;List of disasters omitted&gt;

Well I got to the Convention sure I had at least two spare films packed
in my camera bag but found I had none! I just managed a few long shots of
Kate. Also, someone came up to me and asked if I had any spare batteries
for the camera as hers had run out.

&gt;Subject:    Katemas 1991
&gt;
&gt;I know its abit early,but I think the uk/european lovehounds should organise
&gt;themselves for a get together on Katemas(or near as poss!!) next year.The US
&gt;lovehounds will be having their party probably,so we could telephone one (or
&gt;more) of the parties whilst we have one.This will make sure us non-US
&gt;lovehounds don't feel left out!!!
&gt;Have any uk lovehounds got any ideas about: venue,precise date,what to do???
&gt;If we can get every uk/european or even rich US lovehounds to respond,it
&gt;would be great,and it would be a chance to meet up before the TOUR!!!After
&gt;Saturday I've acquired a liking for Kate get-togethers.Hope to hear from you
&gt;all soon.

Yea, it would be good not to have to wait several years to meet people
again. The US parties occur at people's homes. I am not sure how many
UK/European people are likely to want to join in - we might need someone
with a preety large house! If we want to hire a hall somewhere then it
means people will need to pay something. Perhaps we can have a number of
gatherings around the UK - e.g. Jem, yourself and I are all located in
the Midlands. Perhaps there could be a Southern and Northern party as well?
Of course, in July there would be a reasonable chance of good weathe and
we could all arrange to have an outdoor gathering - on the Moors for instance.
