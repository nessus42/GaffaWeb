&gt;kaufman@delta.eecs.nwu.edu (Michael L. Kaufman) asks:
&gt;
&gt;   Somebody said that the video that they showed will never be sold.  Is that
&gt;   something they said at the convention or a guess or what?  I (and I am sure
&gt;   all the people who wern't at the con) would love to see it.
&gt;
&gt;I seem to remember that someone in the audience yelled out that the video
&gt;should be sold or made available or something like that.  I think it
&gt;was Dave (?) (the MC guy) who kind of rolled his eyes, looked at the
&gt;other Homeground people on the stage with I kind of "O my god,
&gt;wouldn't that be a task" look on his face, and said that it would
&gt;probably never happen.  I don't remember if he said why not, though.

  I think it was something to do with getting the rights to include
film from all the different TV companies across Europe being VERY
difficult (ie. impossible) to arrange.  Alas.

  A huge hello to all the fine Love Hounds I met at the Convention!
In no particular order: Ed, Chris'n'Vickie, Larry, Phil, Rick, Greg,
Andy Marvick, Andy Semple, Evan, Jorn, and everyone else!  It was
great actually seeing you all and it made the day really special!  Hi
also to the rest of the Love Hounds 'B' team!  Shame we were only
second...

  A Love Hound asked who Alan Murphy and Gary Hurst were: Alan was a
guitarist who had played on *most* of Kate's albums, I think he was
also in a band called Go West, but I could be wrong.  He helped Kate
write 'Waking the Witch'.  Gary was one of the dancers in the Tour of
Life, and may have done some BVs on a few albums as well.  They both
died from AIDS last year.

   Chris
