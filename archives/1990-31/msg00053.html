Vickie here. One more thing. I never did tell the story about how Chris 
and I were able to go. In April, when we still lived in Kansas City, we
flew up to Chicago to see the Bulgarian Chorus in concert. We had gotten 
one of those cheapie $33.00 round trip fares. On the way back we were
scheduled for a Monday morning business flights. American had overbooked
and asked for volunteers to give up their seats. We looked at each other and
thought no, why should we. The airline got desperate and then offered a
$400.00 travel voucher for those who would give up their seats. Then we
were first in line to volunteer! Since moving to Chicago Chris had used
up his voucher flying back to Kansas City and to Dallas but I hadn't used 
mine up at all. When the convention was announced I thought about my voucher
but there's no way I would have gone without Chris (we've been together
8 years and met because of Kate) so I dropped the idea. Then American 
announced a $180.00 one way fare and we tightened our belts for a few
weeks to pay for Chris' ticket. In all, Chris and I both flew for under
$400.00, including the initial $33.00 we paid in April! 

All because we went to see the Bulgarian Female Radio and TV Choir!
