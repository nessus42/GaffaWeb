&gt;I sat on the left side of the plane in a 
&gt;window seat so I was able to see and recognize most of the major cities 
&gt;we flew over. Washington, Baltimore, New York, Providence and Boston-at
&gt;night too! 
consider me to have waved hello to you up there.

&gt;It's so GREAT to finally meet people whose names I'd
&gt;been seeing for months now. 
perhaps we should plan to meet more often (or in my case, meet sometime) 
perhaps on the half-katemas?  

&gt;Chris and I found a wonderful fish &amp; chips shop in Leicester Square. I've
&gt;become addicted to fish &amp; chips-now I have to find a place in Chicago
&gt;that makes them English style.
there's a wonderful place in costa mesa, california, and there's a place in
meriden, connecticut that i haven't tried yet.  you should have no problem
finding a place in chicago.  good luck.

&gt;Later
&gt;that evening we went back to the hostel and had the enormous pleasure of
&gt;watching Episode 1.5 of Twin Peaks. Watching TP in England was definitely
&gt;one of the major highlights of the trip! I'm certain that Kate watches it.
&gt;It's exactly the kind of thing she would LOVE!!!!
can we expect a song from her influenced by tp???  :)  wouldn't that be
interesting!  i also could picture her watching this show, although kate almost
seems too...good...to be watching david lynch.

&gt;I'm sorry this is so long. I've edited it down quite a bit already so it
&gt;could have been worse! I just had to get the major things down. 
long?????  i could have read pages more about the konvention.  thank you so
much for sharing everything with us.  it almost makes me feel as if i was
there.

&gt;To those who couldn't make it, I know most of you would have gone if you
&gt;could have afforded it &amp;/or had been able to get the time off work or
&gt;school. You were in our hearts.
thank you.  :-)  

&gt;She Really Is!
no comment is necessary here.
