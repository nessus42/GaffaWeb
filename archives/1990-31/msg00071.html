I wonder... sometime in the future, will we look back and say,
"I remember what I was doing when I heard that KaTe would tour!"  :-)  :-)


Vickie, I did make it, thank you. I did not have the pleasure of meeting
any of the love-hounds, unfortunately. The closest to that that I came
was to watch Andrew take the flowers to the stage -- and then to be
slightly annoyed when it was announced that the Love-Hounds were a large
group of American fans. We Canadian fans temporarily resident in the UK
are slightly touchy about such distinctions  ;-)


I must admit that as a sideline KaTe fan who didn't know the answer
to *any* of the quiz questions, or the spot-prize questions either,
(speaking of which -- could someone post both the questions and
answers here?), I felt a bit lost at the KonvenTion. I had imagined
it would be more like a science fiction convention, at which there is
plenty of opportunity to wander around, meet and talk to people.
At the very least, that the organizers wouldn't have been content with
such a sound system such as that one. My amplifier is admittedly poor,
and it is at home anyhow, so it has been a -long- time since I heard KaTe
through a decent sound system. Perhaps next time/ next gathering, a listening
room or two could be arranged?

Given that love-hounds (or, at least, rec.music.gaffa) sometimes discusses
music other than KaTe's, I thought perhaps there might be a change to get
together with people to discuss and listen to other interesting artists
we know of. I have, for example, found some remarkable Abdullah Ibrahim
(Dollar Brand) cd's in London...


Anyhow... I have one large question arising out of the convention:
Can we arrange for reserved tickets for the forthcoming concerts/ tour ???

I don't know where in the world I'll be this time next year. I might well
be back in North America, but not close enough to any of the major cities
to be able to hop over and camp over-night in the ticket lineups. Could
we, do you think, in cooperation with Homeground and the KBC, somehow
arrange to be short-listed? A block of tickets, perhaps?
