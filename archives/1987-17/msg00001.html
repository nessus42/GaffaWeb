Lately I think I'm either getting paranoid or then it's all true. I
hear on the radio new groups or artists that somehow sound nearly as
progressive stars and yet they try to be authentic.

There are especially three cases I am thinking about:

a) I was visiting the local hamburger bar where I saw on the video screen
Sheena Easton's newest single "Eternity". It was a Kate Bush copy up to
99%. She sang like Bush, the song and the lyrics was like Bush, and the
most awful thing with the video was that the whole movie was a copy
of a typical Kate Bush thing. It all ended with speeded clouds against
a sky (Cloudbusting, you know).

b) There's a newcomer in radio they play a lot here around in Sweden,
the group is called "Red Seven" and the tune is named "When the Sun
goes Down". OK - the voice of the singer is tuned to the Peter Gabriel
voice, and the song and the production is also very near tuned to
Gabriel a la 1982 or Genesis at the same time.

c) I also heared a group called "Dolphin Brothers" that sounded nearly
as David Sylvian/Japan, both the voice and the instrumentation.

Now - I know that this is the business, and everybody knows of the
Elvis clones, the Beatles copies (sorry Utopia, but you tried to be
one) and other megastar fortune seekers that try to make bucks from
the same formula.

But I never knew that people would try to make clones of more musical
and forward seeking artists/groups. Somehow I thought that the market
was too narrow for this kind of business. I think I was wrong.
Anyway, the artists that are copied sure feel fine!

What do we expect next? A Yes-clone called No?
