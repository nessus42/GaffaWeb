[From the Love-Hounds Lost and Found....  -- |&gt;oug]

&gt; From: Niels P. Mayer &lt;mayer%hplabsz@hplabs.HP.COM&gt;

&gt; While I was perusing the Rykodisk selection, I noticed 2 possibly
&gt; interesting CD's -- DEVO's "Easy Listening Music" and the
&gt; compilation "HeartBeat Reggae". I'm particularly interested in the
&gt; former. Is it really easy listening? Is it cheezy listening or is it
&gt; simply a mellow reworking of old DEVO hits? And what is the FDS
&gt; (full dimensional sound) feature that is advertised on the cover of
&gt; the CD?

Well, if by "cheezy listening" you mean lots of laidback string
arrangements with an occasional trumpet solo, no, that's not it.  I,
for one, hesitate to use the word "mellow" to refer to the Easy
Listening reworking...eclectic is more like it.

Waring FDS is just another form of preprocessing that cuts down the
background hiss on mediocre analog recordings and (so it is claimed)
improves their dynamic range.  RYKO's Residents recordings feature
this process; the Green's CD review claimed that it helped a lot.
Since I don't have any non-FDS examples of the same music, I couldn't
tell you myself.

&gt; Also, a while back someone posted that "The Compact XTC" and the
&gt; Dukes of Stratosphear's "Chips from the Chocolate Fireball" are
&gt; available in CD?  I've looked all around and couldn't find 'em. Any
&gt; clues on where I could get them (anyplace in San Francisco, New
&gt; York, Paris or London would do it as I'll have done those cities by
&gt; the end of September).

&gt; -- Niels Mayer.

Isn't there an outlet of Boston Compact Disc in the SF area?  I
presume they would at least have "The Compact XTC".

I frivolously bought a copy of "Dancing on the Couch" just to have a
few more snippets of Kate's voice.  Note the use of the term
"frivolously"...Kate's appearing on this album is much like using a
portable snap-reactor to power a garage door opener.  Not recommended
except for the digital die-hard.

KaTe is God!
