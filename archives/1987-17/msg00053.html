&gt; From: jsd%UMASS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu
&gt;           (Jonathan S. Drukman)

&gt; I've been poring over old LH printouts, and I noticed a consistent
&gt; thread in IED's postings: a tendency to denounce any interpretation
&gt; not specifically given by Kate herself.  Remember the Hot Press
&gt; interview?  ............  IED's editorial comment was "Isn't it
&gt; amazing how people can persist in their own misinformed opinions
&gt; when they have just been told by the ultimate authority of their
&gt; mistake?"  Well, that's not quite fair.

     Why not?  If a) KT IS GOD, -and- b) KT says that the
aforementioned opinion that "The Ninth Wave" is about drug dependance
is in fact, unwarranted then, does it not follow that that is in fact
a true statement?  (GOD said it, how authentic can you get?).

&gt; ...  "The Ninth Wave" turned into a film about someone getting over
&gt; a drug habit.  Imagine the scope of hallucinogenic images that could
&gt; be fitted to the songs themselves!!  The possibility is quite
&gt; intriguing.

   Well, maybe so, but that still has nothing to do with whether or not the
intended topic of the song is drug dependance.

&gt; I for one hope that people continue to make these mistaken
&gt; interpretations, cos it makes for some pretty intriguing thoughts...

   It's fine with me if people feel a different personal meaning in
the song than the one intended by Kate, as long as they don't try to
insist that their personal meaning is more valid in a universal sense
that the intended one.

&gt;    Just because Kate didn't have it in mind when it was written
&gt; doesn't mean that it wasn't lurking there in her subconscious, and
&gt; us clever listeners can read things into Kate's art that Kate
&gt; herself never dreamed was in there...

   Kate is god, what if she doesn't really have a subconcious?  What
if she only thinks that she has a subconscious?  :-) (actually, by a
similar argument, if she thniks she has a subconscious, and she is
god, she therefore has a subconscious, if only by deific mandate)

   Now, on to a couple of other things...  How does one get IED's
master list of KT?  (oh, while i'm asking, if I had a printed
interview, i would be willing to type it in for all to enjoy) Also,
does anyone know where I could get the french import CD of "Never for
Ever"?  I really want the french version of "The Infant Kiss" on CD,
and the only ones avail locally are the USA and UK versions.
