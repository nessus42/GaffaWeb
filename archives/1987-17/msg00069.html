[From the Love-Hounds Lost and Found... -- |&gt;oug]

In article &lt;870906225326.527199@HIS-PHOENIX-MULTICS.ARPA&gt; "James J. Lippard" 
 &lt;Lippard@HIS-PHOENIX-MULTICS.ARPA&gt; quotes this article:

&gt;  [...]
&gt; By no means are domestic groups the idols of Australian young
&gt; people.  The singer for the well-known Australian rock group INXS,
&gt; Jenny Morris, admits that "Australia is much too Americanized, and
&gt; too often Australians look to America for approval."

Jenny Morris?  What the hell happened to Michael Hutchence?

&gt;  It's somehow awkward to talk about rock music in esthetic terms,
&gt; even though the music obviously does sometimes attain the level of
&gt; real art.

And how does it attain this level?  Maybe by BEING REAL ART IN THE
FIRST PLACE?

&gt; But ever since the Beatles no one in the West bothers with such
&gt; discussions.  Everywhere in the reviews of new "hits" we read "pop
&gt; industry" and "show business."

&gt;  The generally accepted opinion is that pop has fallen into a
&gt; protracted crisis.  The businessmen of show business have managed to
&gt; tame and commercialize the rebels of yesteryear, who once frightened
&gt; the bourgeoisie with their threatening songs about striving for
&gt; peace and disarmament and universal brotherhood and who protested
&gt; against social ills.

Yup, sounds like America alright.


&gt;  Genuine Australian music is the music of the Aborigines.  They have
&gt; been unable, however, to exploit their native culture to tap the
&gt; heartstrings of the newcomers.  Aborigine young people have been
&gt; forced to speak the language of music.  The first Aborigine rock
&gt; groups appeared in the early '80s.  The group No Fixed Address
&gt; became the most well known of its type, its music is based on the
&gt; rhythms of Aborigine folklore.

&gt;  Since these young men are not following the lead of American
&gt; trends, show business is not giving them any financial support.
&gt; Often they simply perform in bars on an agreement with the owners.
&gt; But in many Australian cities large and small this group's
&gt; performances invariably enjoy success and they've even been able to
&gt; put out a modest album called With My Own Eyes.  Their lot is
&gt; difficult, but they have no intention of bowing their heads.


More power to 'em.

&gt;   -- A. Ivkin, staff correspondent, Sydney
&gt;      Pravda, July 17, 1987
       ^^^^^^

Uh-oh, what have we here?  I hope this doesn't put me in the position
of having to choose between supporting the current power structure of
the American Music Industry or being branded as a Communist
Sympathizer.  I can see it now - "Lock him up; he's a card-carrying
member of a non-commercial band!!"

Is the point of this posting, or of Ivkin's article, that
non-mainstream music has less chance of succeeding in Australia than
it does elsewhere (i.e. in America?)  I think that the record company
executive mentality and its effect on musical radicals is pretty
pervasive throughout the world, although I don't know about Russia.
Are there a lot of really musically revolutionary rock groups getting
big support from the Russian music establishment these days?

And who IS Jenny Morris, anyway?
