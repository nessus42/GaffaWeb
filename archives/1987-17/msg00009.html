KT NEWS:

There are yet more KT bootlegs on the market now.  First, a two-LP set
(title not known yet by IED) featuring a cover that opens from the
middle of the front surface, a la ELP's _Brain Salad Surgery_ cover.
The contents of this boot are the only remaining bootleg tape that had
not yet been exploited by the U.S.-based bootleggers, namely the
Bristol concert tapes, which are distinguished by their inclusion of
the poetry-readings and weird chants and music played during the
costume-changes between numbers in the Tour of Life shows.

The second boot is a new seven-inch picture-disc interview record of
Kate, imported from Italy.

The third is one IED hasn't seen yet personally, but has read about in
the September issue of _Record Collector_. It's an LP called _Under
the Ivy Bush_.

Finally, the long-promised collection of the lyrics and music to "all"
of Kate's songs is finally to be released. Details and a review
tomorrow (although what meaning does "tomorrow" have in Love-Hounds
anymore?).

Incidentally, until such time as Love-Hounds is once again being
distributed with a reasonable degree of regularity, IED will not be
able to give the same kind of loyal support for it that he has in the
past. This news will no doubt delight many of those readers who aren't
seriously interested in Kate and her career. The rest of you, however,
might want to investigate further.
