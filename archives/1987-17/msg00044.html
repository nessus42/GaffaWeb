[From the Love-Hounds Lost and Found.... --|&gt;oug]

&gt; From: ag@crash.CTS.COM (Keith Gabryelski)

&gt; From: jsd%UMASS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu (Jonathan S. Drukman)
&gt;&gt; Subject:  Was kate a headbanger or what?

&gt;&gt; ....  While leafing through the jewel booklet, I noticed that
&gt;&gt; on the last page with the other credits was a line that said:
&gt;&gt;          "This album was made to be played loud"

&gt; from Todd Rundgren's "A Wizard" inside sleave:
&gt;		      ---&gt; Important Notice &lt;---

&gt; I'm sure you've heard this before, but due to the fact that you can
&gt; only put so moch music on a piece of plastic before you start to
&gt; loose some of the sound, and due to the fact that I have exceeded
&gt; what is considered the practical norm by at least 6 or 7 minutes per
&gt; side, you will probably want to crank up your victrola as loud as it
&gt; will go to get the full enjoyment contained on this here L.P.

Yep, Todd had this "be kind to the customer" solution when he put
together LP:s like "UTOPIA", the B-side called "ICON" is approximately
35 minutes long, and it's a completely whole song, even if it twistes
here and there.  Also the LP "Initiation" with the B-side called
"Treatise on Cosmic Fire" is 35 minutes long. It's one of the first
very synthesized albums ever made - and today it sounds very stunning
compared to what equipment was availiable at that time (1976?).

Due to this package of much music on a plastic platter the sound is
very compressed and both the highs and the lows are cutted so you have
to "crank up" your Hi-fi. Unfortunately there are a lot of pops, hiss
and noice that also gets amplified. There are going to be a major
release of Runt's albums on CD, and boy I'm saving my overtime pay
to get these. Imagine to hear these wacko songs on CD mixed from
the original tapes!

PS: Was Todd the "Kate Bush" of the seventies? If the net existed 
    1970 would there be a rec.music.runt?
