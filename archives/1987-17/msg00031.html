&gt; &gt;Doug: ...But you don't agree?

&gt; &gt;Kate: Well, no, I don't, because that's not...That was...nothing
&gt; &gt;      that was in my head when I was writing it. But then I think
&gt; &gt;      the interpretations that people have of your songs
&gt; &gt;      afterwards are nothing to do with me anyway...

&gt; &gt;Doug: Okay. That seems reasonable. MAYBE IT WAS ALL
&gt; &gt;      SUBCONSCIOUS (IED's emphasis.) It all seems so perfect to me.
&gt; &gt;	 I dunno.

&gt;     Of all the bollocks! Whether Kate had this idea in mind or not is
&gt; hardly something any of us could know. IED would like to know how anyone of
&gt; us could be so patronizing, so condescending, so _conceited_, even, to
&gt; have the effrontery to say what was in _Kate's_ subconscious mind?!
&gt; Hell, after years of psycho-analysis it's still very problematic
&gt; even for a highly trained and skilled analyst to gauge the workings
&gt; of a patient's unconscious mind. Thanks a lot, but IED prefers to
&gt; trust Kate's answer over that of the over-zealous, overly self-confident
&gt; outsider.

Well, I still think I am right.  I guess I'm just over-zealous and
overly-confident, but Kate says that "There Goes a Tenner" is a song
about fear.  She also says that recording *The Dreaming* was the the
most frightening thing she ever did.  It still seems to be that it'd
an awfully big coincidence that she'd write a song about fear while
engaging upon the most frightening endeavor of her life, and have the
two things be unrelated.

I also think that it highly unlikely that a famous rock star would
come up with the image of "Hounds of Love" and not have gotten the
image at least in part, by thinking of fans.  Picturing fans as
"hounds of love" would be the most natural thing in the world for a
rock star.  I'm not saying that the song "Hounds of Love" has anything
whatsoever to do with fans.  Just that the fact that she came up with
this image is due to in part the fact that she has rabid fans.

|&gt;oug

P.S.  If I'm so overconfident, how come when I told Kate about "My
Lagan Love", she poo-pooed my ideas away?  Later, when talking to her
brother John, I found out from him that he had actually done most of
the work on those lyrics.  I then told him my ideas, and he said that
I was absolutely right.  Explain this, Mr. Marvick.
