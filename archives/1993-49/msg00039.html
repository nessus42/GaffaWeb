&gt;&gt; Any thoughts?

&gt;OK you asked for it.

[stuff deleted]
 
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering what people here thought of Bjork. I bought
&gt;&gt; Debut a couple of weeks ago and after some initial reservations
&gt;&gt; I now think it is brilliant. Her voice is certainly not
&gt;&gt; technically perfect, but I love it all the more for that reason.
&gt;&gt; I used to *hate* Play Dead (on the radio) but now I think it is
&gt;&gt; simply amazing (the lyrics... ). I could go on, but I won't since
&gt;&gt; you are probably wanting to read a more Kate-esque post ;-)

Maybe you are in the "initial reservations" phase mentioned above.
In the early days I would turn the radio off whenever she came on.
Give it time...

&gt;What do I think of Bjork. Hummmm, let's see...
&gt;She looks like a pig,

Is this relevent? I always assumed she was singer, not  a cover girl.
I must be mistaken. (Besides, I have seen unflattering pics of KT
before, but this has NO influence on my appreciation of her music).
Should it?

&gt;her voice is like tonal diarrhoea and her
&gt;music (if one should call it that) is undescribably irritating.
&gt;Her voice being " not technically perfect" is something I could
&gt;live with, were it not for the shrill, high-pitched, a-musical
&gt;noise it produces. I mean, it's like hearing an F16 flying up into
&gt;the air (and believe me, _that's_ not a pretty sound).
&gt;As for "the lyrics...", they consist of commonplaces and semi-
&gt;intellectual blob.

If I was her I would be very flattered that I had managed to excite
such violent emotion.  Better than being bland, don't you think?
 
&gt;I think Bjork (a name, BTW which reminds me of pigs, which is very
&gt;appropriate given her aforementioned exterior) 

what's with your preoccupation for appearences. Are you *that* shallow?

&gt;is one of the most ...[misc ranting deleted]...

&gt;and I wouldn't mind her losing her voice
&gt;permanently as of today. (I would have typed "shot dead", but I'm
&gt;a pascifist :-) )
   ^^^^^^^^^
you surprise me.

&gt;I hope this ends the talk about this tart on this list as of now.
				      ^^^^
I must say I am very impressed by your ability to determine that
she is a prostitute, or at the least sexually immoral (OED) apparently
on the basis of her appearences and songs. I wish I was as astute as you.
 
&gt;Move it to the list that mudheap belongs to, thankyewverymuch.

&gt;Don't flame me now, The question _was_ :
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering what people here thought of B

Maybe I was after some more considered thought.
Mind you, I must thank you for giving me a good laff during my dull lab
session :-)

&gt;...................
&gt;&lt;Too sick for a sig&gt; 
&gt;...................
Hope you feel better soon ;-)
