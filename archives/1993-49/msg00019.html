Has anyone kept a running tab of what interviews have been posted?  Kevin 
Hendryx forwarded a packet of xeroxes from a friend in the UK and I am 
willing to type in those which haven't appeared yet.  The most 
interesting at this point is one with Del which does a track-by-track of 
the album and discusses some of the musical motivations behind methods of 
recording, instrumentation choices, etc.  I vaguely remember an interview 
with Del being posted earlier but I don't think it was this one, which is 
from "Future Music" magazine.

Why Pulse?  Is there an interview?  (and what is the use of a book, 
thought Alice, without pictures and conversations!)

2 cents on Lily-related discussion: Many of Dion Fortune's books are no
longer in print in the U.S., but can sometimes be found at secondhand book
stores and occult shops.  Crowley, as with many of the Golden Dawn
adherents, wrote books that are difficult to read.  He was very stuck on
himself and a great deal of his prose consists of admonitions that he is
so knowledgable and so powerful that did he share his secrets it would
blast your poor little gonads into oblivion.  Poo Poo. 

There are many ways to create safe space/sacred space.  If anyone is 
interested they can easily find various ways described in books such as 
Starhawk's "The Spiral Dance".  There are literally thousands of new 
books in the occult genre that are readable, interesting, easy to understand.

Happy hunting.
