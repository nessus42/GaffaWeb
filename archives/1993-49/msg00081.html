Ahem,
 
Well then, after this ranting and raving of you all :), can I say
a few words back now?
 
Well then here I go....

&gt; Remember r.m.g/love-hounds was not created just for discussing
&gt; Kate, as the FAQ says.
XQze me for not reading the smallprint - in a document that never
crossed my eyes btw. However, I find it very strange (to say but
the least) that a subject like this can generate somuch discussion
and all my previous postings none at all. But that's a small
observation, just to illustrate the low-Kate content on this list
when clearly things have been happening these last few weeks...
 
A certain 'Johan' writes:
&gt; I don't mind you disliking Bjork, that's completely up to you,
&gt; but mixing her name into it is rather pathetic.
I have to say about whom I talk, don't I?
 
&gt; You obviously don't know what it means nor how it's pronounced.
That's very funny &lt;ha-ha&gt; since I have Scandinavian family. I never
_pronounced_ her name on the list, did I? If I did, please show me
where..... I just stated an association of words which can be
concluded by anyone, well, anyone who can read, that is...
 
&gt; but it might help you to realize that your comments on Bjork
&gt; smells not only of provincialism, but of a small and scantily
&gt; informed mind in general.
...and _you_ didn't *read* my message, mister. So _who_ is in the
possession of a small and scantily informed mind? BTW attacks on me
personally because I happen to have a different opinion about
something (and yes, I do acknowledge that my opinions are put in
strong terms - but then, holding my tongue is something I _never_
do) are very _very_ uncivilised. _Don't_ try to demean me, it won't
work.
 
And finally, this one really takes the cake:
 
Stu Castergine writes:
&gt; Does anybody find the repeated references to Bjork's appearance
&gt; disconcerting?
OK so I should have put that remark on the _end_ of the list. GOD,
do I have to spell _everything_ out?
...
&gt; What if Kate weighed 350 lb.? What if Tori had a face that would
&gt; scare small children? Why do we demand physical beauty from
&gt; female musicians?
I wouldn't care, to be precise. I WOULDN'T CARE, once again, for
those of you who obviously couldn't read my previous message. Do I
really have to put down a list of ugly women I have records of? I
won't, but let me say this: putting words into my mouth _can_ be
done, but I _do_ tend to stick up for myself.
 
Greg O'Rear writes:
&gt; "But I don't have to look like a model; I'm just a computer
&gt; nerd!"
Let me propose: "But I don't have to read someone messages, I can
make up texts myself!"
 
To conclude:
I still hate 'er, I won't change my mind unless I have reason to,
and my words are (possibly) stated bluntly, because I am just that
way. I don't really care what people say about me, but I think it's
rather childish to flame someone for stating his opinion,
especially he's asked to amongst others, who then don't but just
react on what one says.
Once again, there is a mailing list for 'er, use it!
 
Hope the subject Kate will appear on this list every now and then
as of today. (Well, I can dream, can't I??)

PS Hey! Why not change "Love-Hounds" into "Blood-Hounds"?
