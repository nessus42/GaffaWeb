&gt; She looks like a pig, her voice is like tonal diarrhoea and her

&gt; I think Bjork (a name, BTW which reminds me of pigs, which is very
&gt; appropriate given her aforementioned exterior) is one of the most
&gt; untalented, overrated, ugly and blood-before-eyes-generating

Does anybody find the repeated references to Bjork's appearance
disconcerting? I have never seen Bjork, so I can't comment, but that
is not really the point I want to make.

I have noticed that it seems to be almost necessary to be a knock-out
babe to succeed as a woman in music. Yes, there have been a few homely
ones -- Janis Joplin, Mama Cass, a few others (though none spring
immediately to mind). But there seems to be an unfair emphasis on the
appearance of women in pop music.

Not to denigrate the abilities of Tori Amos, Kate Bush, or Sarah
McLachlan, but do you think they would be as popular as they are if
they were unattractive? Not that Sarah is a superstar. Then again,
she's the least attractive of those three. Still cute though.

What if Kate weighed 350 lb.? What if Tori had a face that would scare
small children? Why do we demand physical beauty from female
musicians?

There are a *lot* of very famous male musicians out there who are
*ugly.* Physical attractiveness is something we rarely require from
male musicians.

Meatloaf? Ugly!
Mick Jagger? Ugly!! (but charismatic)
Tom Petty? (ugly!)
whats-his-face-who-married-julia-roberts? Ridiculous-looking!
Ric Ocasek? (married to Paulina Porizkova. We can also start a topic
about really ugly musicians who are married to beautiful women. It
gives all unmarried ordinary guys hope). He's pretty sorry-looking.
And ... isn't everyone just waiting for Jerry Garcia to do a video
where he's strutting around in tight leather and spandex?

There are probably hundreds of women out there with voices that would
bring tears to your eyes, make you get down on your knees and beg them
never to stop singing, who would make you say "Kate Who?" but they are
ugly and they'll never get a chance.

&gt;From the few scans I've seen of Happy Rhodes, she's pretty
ordinary-looking, maybe going as far as mildly attractive, and I would
not doubt that has hurt her career. If she was as beautiful as Kate,
she probably would have a major record contract right now. (I know
some people on ecto think she's pretty, but I have very little data to
go on -- she looks nice on the Warpaint cover, but the Whole
Story-esque promo picture I've seen doesn't thrill me.)

It ain't fair.
