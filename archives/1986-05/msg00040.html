Here is a complete list, for Fu-Sheng Tsung, of Peter Gabriel's work with
Genesis, and solo:

With Genesis:
---- -------
FROM GENESIS TO REVELATION (1969)
TRESPASS (1970)
NURSERY CRYME (1971)
FOXTROT (1972)
GENESIS LIVE (1973)
SELLING ENGLAND BY THE POUND (1973)
THE LAMB LIES DOWN ON BROADWAY (1974)

Solo:
----
PETER GABRIEL (1977)
PETER GABRIEL (1978)
PETER GABRIEL (1980)
PETER GABRIEL (1982)
PLAYS LIVE (1984)

Gabriel's songwriting with Genesis was much more obtuse and heavy in content
than his solo work. Most critics and fans agree that "Supper's Ready" (off
of _Foxtrot_) and the album _The_Lamb_Lies_Down_On_Broadway_ are Gabriel's
magnum opi. They are very different from anything off of his solo albums -
be warned!!!

Whereas in his solo career, PG opted for a more conventional approach to
songs (i.e. usually five minutes or less, normal rhythms on the whole, etc),
in his work with Genesis he was bent more toward allegorical metaphysics,
elaborate tales going for 7 or 8 or even 22 minutes; long instrumental breaks,
odd rhythms, sensual (tho not sensual) imagery in his lyrics, and a dash of
bizarre thrown in. Things seemed to be toning down when SELLING ENGLAND was
released - "I Know What I Like (in your wardrobe)" actually hit the British
charts, and the album had a more middle-of-the-road rockish feel to it. With
the release of LAMB LIES DOWN (aka "Peter Does Psylocibin"), they kept the
length of the songs short, but made the content so bizarre that none of the
songs could get commercial airplay - sorta like trying to release "The Morning
Fog" as an a-side, just doesn't work without the rest of The Ninth Wave. After
leaving Genesis, Gabriel's first album was a shock - commercialism ruled,
overproduction ruled, but even so it was an album to be proud of. Gabriel
fans worldwide took the change in stride, and of course PG has continued to
produce albums of quality.

Hope it was helpful... makes sense here at 3am, will it make sense at 2pm?
