&gt; Anyway, my question is regarding one of the songs from Broken English,
&gt; "The Ballad of Lucy Jordan".  Lyrically (and musically) this is one
&gt; of the mildest songs on the album.  I just can't figure out what the
&gt; lyrics are in the last section of the song, and consequently what 
&gt; happens to her.  Can someone help?  Here's what I got (bear with me!):

	&gt; The morning sun touched lightly on/The eyes of Lucy Jordan
	&gt; In a white suburban bedroom/In a white suburban town
        &gt; As she laid there 'neath the covers
	&gt; Dreaming up a thousand lovers
        &gt; Till the world turned to orange/And the room went spinning round

	&gt; (chorus)
	&gt; At the age of 37/She realized
	&gt; She never ride through Paris
	&gt; In a sports car
        &gt; With the warm wind in her hair
        &gt; So she let the phone keep ringing
	&gt; And she sat there softly singing
	&gt; Little nursery rhymes/She'd memorized
        &gt; In her daddy's easy chair

	&gt; Her husband is off to work/And the kids were off to school
	&gt; And there were oh so many ways/For her to spend the day
        &gt; She can clean the house for hours
	&gt; Or rearrange the flowers
(I think) Run naked through the shady streets
	&gt; Screaming out away

	&gt; (Chorus)
	&gt; (and the last part:)

	&gt; The evening sun touched gently on/The eyes of Lucy Jordan
	&gt; On the rooftop
	&gt; Where she climbed
        &gt; When all the laughter grew too loud
(I think) She vowed(?) and cursed to the man
          Who reached and offered her his hand
          And he led her down to the long white car
          That waited past the crowd.

	&gt; At the age of 37/She knew
        &gt; She found forever
	&gt; How she would've (roared(?)) through Paris
	&gt; With the warm wind in her hair

I gather she was going to jump and they took her off in a straight jacket.

              -- Lisa
