&gt; this interpretation:  Is Kate subtly reprimanding her fans?  From
&gt; memory, "Rip me open / with devotion / stick your hands in / and rip
&gt; my heart out".  Is this really supposed to be a fruit?  Hmm...
&gt;      The song itself is very I-IV-V-IV-Iish, very bouncy, very
&gt; commercial.  I can't help but think this is intentional, and I can't
&gt; imagine Kate writing a song for the market.  So what interpretation is
&gt; left?  That's what makes me think she's taking a swipe at possibly
&gt; over-devoted fans who want too much from her?  Maybe?  I don't know
&gt; what exactly what would cause her to feel that way, but... I dunno.
&gt; And taking a swipe at commercial music?

Yeah, I've wondered the same thing.  Or perhaps it's her career that's
ripping her open with devotion (less likely I think from the rest of
the lyrics)?  Both interpretations would fit with the theme of being
possesed by ones career or passion that seems to be in The Red Shoes
movie, from what I've read and from the Bravo special on the
filmmaker.  The video does show her being exhausted... from eating the
music?  from passion?  from letting go and opening up?  from being
possesed?  from over-performing?  from all?

I don't think those can be the only interpretations though, since
much of the song is about splitting open a man to reveal his insides.
I think what's important is that there are many possible
interpretations, and *that* probably wasn't unintentional, although
that wasn't necessarily conscious.  That is art.

I still like the song a lot; it helps me let go.
