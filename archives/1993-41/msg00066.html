&gt;     I've heard ETM on the radio a few times, and I can't help but get
&gt;this interpretation:  Is Kate subtly reprimanding her fans?  From
&gt;memory, "Rip me open / with devotion / stick your hands in / and rip
&gt;my heart out".  Is this really supposed to be a fruit?  Hmm...
&gt;     The song itself is very I-IV-V-IV-Iish, very bouncy, very
&gt;commercial.  I can't help but think this is intentional, and I can't
&gt;imagine Kate writing a song for the market.  So what interpretation is
&gt;left?  That's what makes me think she's taking a swipe at possibly
&gt;over-devoted fans who want too much from her?  Maybe?  I don't know
&gt;what exactly what would cause her to feel that way, but... I dunno.
&gt;And taking a swipe at commercial music?
&gt;     Interpretation aside, I enjoy the song, but it's _way_ down there
&gt;on my list.

    I think that's potentially very insightful and happens to go well
    with an interpretation of the title song, "The Red Shoes", that I have
    been mulling over ever since I got a copy of the album two weeks ago.

    The story told by tRS is fairly simple, but then the best allegories
    are.  My first impression of the song is that the shoes are an allegory
    for Kate's decision to market her talents.  The song's protagonist
    discovers that once the shoes are on, that it's impossible to stop
    dancing, which is not necessarily a great thing.  I think that this
    could be symbolic for Kate's experience with the music industry and
    her fans.  She feels under an extreme ammount of pressure to continue
    to make music, but isn't really sure how much of a good thing it is
    anymore.

    I can't wait for the movie to clear all this up or cloud the issue(s)
    even further.

    Cheers,
