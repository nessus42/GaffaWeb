(am posting this to mod.music,gaffa and rec.music.misc in order to 
 get this the widest world distribution - I hope you agree the message
 herein is important enough)

In regards to this INS H-1 work permit contro:

In the most recent Village Voice (cover story is on The New Sobriety), there
is a comprehensive article on the INS and the proposed regulatory changes.
some points I haven't seen mentioned on this newsgroup are:

1) the new regulations hurt non-commercial artists the most who theoretically
pose no threat to the union/commercial artists.  This is because of two
reasons:
	a) it wil be and is hard to prove "pre-emminence", though some of the 
	  more "artistic" groups are able to get critical aclaim, the groups
	  such as hardcore/wave/little known rock won't be able to.
	  I'd hate to think the hacks who write for the English music
	  press will be involved in the decision of who can work over here.
	  Previously, underground bands especially hardcore, were
 	  brought into the country on a temporary non-work visa which
          was routinely violated (Another "un-related" law is being
	  changed to heavily fine artists and promoters who violate
	  this temporary nonwork visa) and smuggled their equipment
          through Canada.


	b) Suprisingly enough, in this supposedely non-socialist country,
        the Amercan Federation of Musicians (AFL-CIO)  are used as
	references as to judghing the "pre-eminance" of musicians/groups/
	artists.  It was sadly and subtly pointed out that the current
	advisor has had limited musical experience (weddings and affairs)
	and bases his decisions on "shakey" cases merely on his acquaintance
	with the venues and promoters (I imagine this is how Paul Simon
	got his South African musican friends over here).  Long time readers
	of this net are aware of my opinion of the American Federation of
	Musicians - most areas where AFM is strongest have the least
	bold above-ground pop/rock music scene (or so I've found through my 
        travels)

2) It is really too late to protest to the INS (though they claim they
will give all letters consideration, the expiration date for protests
has expired).  However, the Voice pointed out that if you have any
specific incidents that you know of where H-1 visas were unfairly turned
down or anything related, you should write to Senator Paul Simon.  He
is collecting as much evidence as he can. I hope this message gets
distribution outside north america for that reason.  (Hon. Sen. Paul
Simon, US Senate, Washington D.C. 20510)

3) The article pointed out that these new regulations are a result of
many different factors: streamlining of an already overworked govermental
agency, ignorance about world/art among officals and it's suggested this
is a result of Reagen appointees who have a indirect policy (in the
grand tradition of Charles Wick) of supressing ideas foriegn, or not
concurrent with Administration thinking (Judeo-fundamentalist-Christian
ethics).  In a way, this is a sign of an efficient state - perhaps one
of the most subversive things to the state is "art" or whatever you
want to call this stuff we go mining for.

If you don't care about this - just don't complain to me when the
only type of artists who come into our country are Julio Igleaisas
and the Rolling Stones....
