To help clear up some confusion here is a list of the tracks on the
two bootleg CDs put out by Chapter one with the titles "If You Could See Me
Fly" and "Passing Through Air". Note that any vinyl records with
these titles almost certainly contain different material.

I am also giving the title of the track as listed in Homeground No. 36
(Autumn 1989) which they gleaned from a release called "Fiddle" and
other sources. I may well make some mistakes in the comparison here
so anyone feel free to correct this list. Also, most of these titles
cannot be substantiated in any form as being correct as they have never
been officially published. IED probably has far more information at his
finger tips and indeed has posted detailed listings in the past. However,
this list is just intended to give people some idea of what is on the discs
as a number seem to be interested in buying the CDs. As I have forked out
95 quid for the box set I do not apologise for publicising these illegal
recordings. Make your own mind up if you want to buy them.
