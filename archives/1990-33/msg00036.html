Larry oh Larry, where art thou Larry? No word, not a peep...
Where's your Convention Report?

Graham oh Graham, where are you? Aren't you back yet?
Let's hear some rahs from Down Under.

woj, did Meredith give you a convention report in her letter to you?
If so, please post it. I for one fell dead in love with her and
can't wait till she's back among us. She is *SO* cool!!! 

Our photos came back and I only got a few fairly decent photos of
Kate. I was close but there were two people in front of me and I
had to shoot Kate between their heads. Some shots were ruined because
they moved at the wrong time. Halfway during the "talk" I left the
front and gave the camera to Chris in the back. He got a lot of long
shots but none of them came out especially well. IED, it wasn't just
using a flash that caused problems with overexposure because we didn't
have a flash and all our long shots are the same in that Kate is washed
out. There was such a bright white light on her that she's little more
than a white blur in the middle of the shot, while everything else in
the picture looks fine.
