Dave Datta writes about the Eclectic Music Survey:

&gt; The main intent of this survey was to get an idea of what net folks had
&gt; to say about different artists. 

It's a GREAT idea. I didn't contribute last time and I'm hoping to get
some things in this one...however...

&gt; The final survey results totaled 387K. 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT POST THIS TO REC.MUSIC.GAFFA!!!!! PLEASE!
                     ^^ ^^^
Because Gaffa is also a mailing list, these lists cannot be avoided.
Post it to rec.music.misc and we can get them at our leisure, when we
have the time and disc space. Not everyone gets net access for free.
We pay, monthly &amp; per hour, plus our long-distance phone bills. 

If there are those on .gaffa who do not have access to rec.music.misc
but want the survey, you can send it to them via e-mail or they can get 
it via FTP. Please, I ask on behalf of everyone on the mailing list-DO NOT
POST this to rec.music gaffa.

They are great to read but just take up too much space in our mailbox.


&gt;    If you would prefer I do not use this new survey and ran a repeat
&gt;    of the last survey, please let me know. The purpose of these
&gt;    things is to help you, the reader obtain information about artists
&gt;    that you would not have otherwise known.

&gt;    Another possibility is to run BOTH surveys, please, I really would
&gt;    like to know what you want to see.


Combine the two. Comments AND essential albums. It never hurts to have
specifics on both subjects.

&gt; Current List: (There are 1400+ artists in this list....)

There are some you don't have that I can think of right away. I'll be
working on this one.
