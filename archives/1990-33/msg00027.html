&gt;From: barger@aristotle.ils.nwu.edu (Jorn Barger)
&gt;One clip I found eye-opening in the video spectacular at the Kon was from
&gt;a British comedy show (someone fill in the details?) where an incredibly
&gt;obnoxious lout was shouting to someone offstage who he claimed was having
&gt;carnal relations with Kate Bush... The offstage character replies that
&gt;he's actually having sex with... [someone even more preposterous], and
&gt;"just using Kate Bush as a contraceptive!"

This was from the live stage performance Comic Relief - though the
people concerned were members of The Young Ones TV show cast (three of
whom also feature in most of the Comic Strip films).

The obnoxious lout was Ric (aka Pric) played by Ric Mayall and the
offstage character was Vyvian (Ade Edmondson). I think what he said
was that he was having sex with Kate Bush and using Neil as the
contraceptive. My namesake being played by Nigel Planer.

As for Kate's likely reaction - have a listen again to the lyrics of
her duet with Rowan Atkinson.

&gt;If anyone is interested I will summarise my reactions to each  album.
&gt;You guys who've heard them all already might be surprised to a 'novices'
&gt;reaction.

Yes go ahead, I for one would like to know your reactions.

&gt;Subject: Famous Kate fans

I know you said you did not just want people who ahd worked with Kate, but
you should add to the list the leader of Big Country (can't remember
his name but he said he was a fan in an interview I posted a few years back).
Also, what about the members of Go West?

&gt;You've convinced me.  I'll buy the LP set as well as the CDs just for
&gt;the larger booklet and the extra picture.  Of course then I'll have
&gt;to complain that I was ripped off...

The major rip-off now seems to be in the prices being charged by some
US and all GB retail outlets. The prices quoted from Canada, NZ and some
parts of the US make buying a second copy of 6 CDs less onerous. If the
set had been sold in the UK at a lower price my original complaints
would have less severe. The fact is that several of the CDs are being sold
separately in adjacent racks at mid-price. Yet in the box set we have to
pay full price (in GB at least).

Andy Semple has already posted some information about the piece in Q, but here
are a few more details which I posted but seemed to get lost:

In the January (91) issue of Q magazine there is an article about a
forthcoming TV series called Bringing It All Back Home. It is in 5 parts
and "traces the extraordinary journey of Irish traditional music and dance
over a couple of centuries to America and back"
".. The programme makers have enlisted the musical services of a wide rnage of
performers - members of U2, The Waterboys, Hothouse Flowers, Pete Seeger, Don
and Phil Everly, Ricky Skaggs, John Cage, Emmylou Harris, Kate Bush and The
Pogues - mixing their cultural and musical backgrounds to underline the point
of the story."

"Besides the 5-part TV series and accompanying book a soundtrack album is also
planned. All the performances are live and even include some special
compositions like Elvis Costello's Mischievous Ghost which he sings with
flame-haired Irish chanteuse Mary Coughlin, backed by Irish piper Davey
Spillane".

Bringing It All Back Home is scheduled to be broadcast in February.

A little while ago I posted here that Rapido on BBC-2 had done a piece on Irish
influences on musicians. This featured a short spot from Kate - whether
they pinched this film from the new series is unknown.

Be seeing you,
	Neil
