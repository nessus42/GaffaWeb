Some people have asked for my evidence that these people are Kate fans.
Here it is:

Sinead O'Connor -- see my signature
Peter Gabriel -- he asked Kate to sing with him several times
Midge Ure (formerly of Ultravox) -- asked Kate to sing on his album, and
	      praised her in interviews
Nigel Kennedy -- has praised Kate in interviews
John Hughes -- asked Kate to sing for his movie
Nicolas Roeg -- asked Kate to sing for his movie
Suzanne Vega -- The Dreaming one of her favorite albums of the 80s.
Dave Gilmour -- discovered Kate
Pat Benatar -- covered W. Heights, which she said was a "beautiful song"
Donny Osmond -- called "Don't Give Up" his "theme song"
Natalie Cole -- covered "The Man With..." several times
Ozzy Osbourne -- TSW one of his favorite albums of the year
Robert Smith (of the Cure) -- TSW one of his favorite albums of the year
Paul Kantner (of Jefferson Airplane) -- TSW on his Christmas wish list
Simon Le Bon and Nick Rhodes (of Duran Duran) -- played the video for
		  Sat in Your Lap when they were guest DJs on MTV
Colin Moulding (of XTC) -- said he was a Kate fan in the XTC fanzine.
	     (Jon Drukman can probably provide the exact quote).

In addition, I've thought of:

Roy Harper -- asked Kate to sing on his album, twice.

Other people have mentioned:

Sarah McLachlan -- said she'd been influenced by Kate
Mick Karn -- IED says he has praised Kate
Fish (of Marillion) -- why?
Dave Gahan (of Depeche Mode) -- why?

Ed Suranyi             | "I couldn't hope to do it anywhere near as well
ed@das.llnl.gov        |  as Kate Bush because she is a Goddess."
