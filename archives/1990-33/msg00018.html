Music Survey #5:

(by the way, thanks for the discographies!)

Sorry if this isn't in alphabetical order.

Laurie Anderson:  "United States I-IV"...a live album with her best 
monologues and great music...excellent production for a live album.
Bauhaus: "The Sky's Gone Out"...shows maturity in sound...enough post-punk 
roots to satisfy.
Kate Bush: "Hounds of Love"...well crafted music, blend of instruments...
Cocteau Twins: "Treasure"...most melodious...I guess a good word to describe 
this album would be "bliss"
Echo &amp; the Bunnymen: "Ocean Rain"...interesting use of orchestra...with 
really good songs like "Killing Moon", "My Kingdom"...one album to 
definitely avoid from them would be "Echo &amp; the Bunnymen": pop garbage.
Peter Gabriel: "Peter Gabriel" (melting face cover). I guess I like it on a 
song to song basis.
Jesus &amp; Mary Chain: "Psychocandy"...lots of good distortion to show that 
post-punk music is still alive...with a subtle blend of 60's blues...avoid 
"Automatic"...their attempt to move into the mainstream.
King Crimson: "In the Court of the Crimson King"...great lyrics and perfect 
music to match...the others just don't reach this one.
Yes: "Fragile"...appealing style of the period, I guess...avoid "Big 
Generator"
Love and Rockets: "Seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven"...best integration of 
"Tones on Tail" and "Bauhaus" like styles, but coming up with something 
entirely new...avoid "Love and Rockets"
Ministry: "The Mind Is a Terrible Thing To Taste"...noisiest, and most 
violent...representative industrial band...avoid "With Sympathy": terrible 
Depeche Mode-like rubbish.
Mike Oldfield: "Tubular Bells"...nice blend of themes...incredible 
melodies...avoid "Earth Moving"...attempt to get into mainstream.
Pink Floyd: "Dark Side of the Moon"...best songs...interesting bridge of old 
styles and new...I've gotten tired of "The Wall", but I have yet to get 
tired of this album...AVOID "Momentary Lapse of Reason"...yuk!
Pixies: "Surfer Rosa"...real a$$-kicking music...addicting.
Pogues: "Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash"...great Irish trad. music styles, and 
Shane's raspy voice...
Public Image Ltd.: "Second Edition"...representative post-punk album...avoid 
"Happy" which is an attempt to get into the mainstream (it seems as if I 
don't like albums that are trying to get into the mainstream, isn't it?)
R.E.M.: "Reckoning"...This is R.E.M...none of that "Stand" crap.  avoid 
"Green"...
The Smiths: "The Queen is Dead"
The Sugarcubes: "Life's Too Good"...really weird...catchy music...great 
singing.
They Might Be Giants: "They Might Be Giants"...they're at their weirdest on 
this one...
Throwing Muses: "Throwing Muses"...great riffs, interesting lyrics...before 
they were trying to sell out...
Ultra Vivid Scene: "Ultra Vivid Scene"
those were ones on your list...here's some additions:

The Minutemen: "Double Nickels on the Dime"...one great song followed by 
another...by another...78 minutes, and not a bad moment on this one.
The Fall: "This Nation's Saving Grace"...great riffs, fairly simple, but 
catchy...
Talking Heads: "Remain in Light"...interesting style of international 
sounds...
Robyn Hitchcock: "I often dream of trains"...most 'sensitive' work and has 
some funny moments...
Camper Van Beethoven: "Telephone Free Landslide Victory"...great 
instrumental work...funny songs...
Too Much Joy: "Son of Sam I Am"...some really humorous lyrics...
New Order: "Brotherhood"...excellent use of guitars with synths...very 
moving...
Joy Division: "Closer"...great depressing stuff...angst-ridden.
Let's Active: "Big Plans for Everybody"...best content...great guitar work.
Love Tractor: "Around the Bend"...great instrumentals, synthesis of guitars.
Guadalcanal Diary: "Walking in the Shadow of the Big Man"...only 30 minutes 
but chock full of good stuff.
Game Theory: "Lolita Nation"...unique style is shown...great songs...
Sonic Youth: "Sister"...this was a hard decision...most all of their albums 
are excellent...
Front 242: "Front By Front"...best music without getting annoying (like some 
of their others)...
Husker Du: "Zen Arcade"...

that's all I can think of for now...
