&gt; Hello!  Please forgive the crossposting, but it seemed that these three
&gt; groups would likely reach any of this artist's fans.

What's unusual is that I wouldn't think there'd be any crossover at
all, but, here I am :-).  I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for
Annette, because if I hadn't liked her, I'd never have heard of Happy
Rhodes (long story).  However, Annette's just about as different as
you could imagine from Happy, Kate, Tori etc., since she's more into
avant-guarde neo-jazz.  The only thing these women have in common is
their fierce independent streak.  I haven't heard what Annette's been
up to, so if you hear anything, please let me know too.

&gt;I am trying to locate recordings by Annette Peacock.  I have three LPs
&gt;from the late '70s/early '80s;
&gt;The Perfect Release
&gt;X-Dreams
&gt;Been in the streets too long

I also have the first 2 LPs, as well as LPs of _Sky-skating_ and _I Have
No Feelings_, plus another live album that I can't seem to find.  I've
never heard _Been In The Streets Too Long_, unless that's the name of
the live album I have, but I don't think so.

&gt;I have heard rumors that some of her music has been released on CD, but
&gt;have been unable to track it down.  It seems that the two labels I know of
&gt;"Tomato" and "Ironic Records" are now defunct.

I've re-bought _X-Dreams_, _Sky-skating_ and _I Have No Feelings_ on CD,
but probably can't help you if you say that Ironic is defunct.  Are you
sure?  My _X-Dreams_ is a German CD, released by Femme/Line Music.  Here's
the info on the 3, if it helps at all:

Sky-skating                   (ironic 2  CD &amp; CP)
Been In The Streets Too Long  (ironic 3  LP only)
I Have No Feelings            (ironic 4  CD &amp; LP)
Abstract-Contact              (ironic 5  CD &amp; LP)
