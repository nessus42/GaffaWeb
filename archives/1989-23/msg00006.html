 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: KT NEWS

     The following notice from the KATE BUSH CLUB arrived in IED's
mailbox today:

     Kate Bush Club
     P.O. Box 120
     Welling, Kent DA16 3DS
     England

     As many of you will already know, Kate's new album "The Sensual
World" will be released on 16th October. We thought you might like to
know in advance about some of the interviews which will be appearing
over the next month or so. As far as Kate knows, she will not be doing
any P.A.s &lt;Personal appearances&gt;.

 Q MAGAZINE....................November issue (out 10th October)
 THE GUARDIAN..................Arts page (12th October)
 MELODY MAKER..................Issue of the week ending 14th October *
 N.M.E.........................Issue of the week ending 14th October **
 YOU MAGAZINE..................15th October
 TRACKS (Free at Woolworths)...November issue (out 26th October)
 R.A.W.........................Issue 31 (out 1st November)
 INTERNATIONAL MUSICIAN........December issue (out 2nd November)--6-pg. intvw.

     There will be articles in various overseas publications but
we could not get definite information in time so keep your ears and
eyes open.
     The Club magazine will be with you soon after the album is released.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

     That is all the note said.

     *--IED believes there was nothing (aside from an album-release
announcement) in the issue of _MM_ for the week _ending_ October 14th.
Perhaps _MM_ means to have an interview in the October 14th issue.

    **--The _NME_ interview for the week ending October 14th (i.e.,
the October 7th issue, IED assumes) did indeed contain a long interview
with Kate, and IED has already transcribed and posted it for the
delectation of Love-Hounds worldwide.

     With luck Neil Calton and the other admirable U.K.-based Love-Hounds
are reading this posting, and perhaps one or more of them will make an
effort to acquire some of the interviews listed above--in particular
those which will probably never be imported to the U.S. American fans
can probably get hold of the _Q_Magazine_ interview, the one in
_The_Guardian_ and the one in _International_Musician_. But things
like the Woolworths throwaway paper _Tracks_, the publication with
the (to IED) mysterious name _R.A.W._, and _You_Magazine_ will almost
certainly never wash up onto U.S. shores, so IED implores the English
philocanines to take pity on us benighted Yanks and obtain/transcribe/
post these rare British treasures as soon as they become available.

     REMEMBER, WEST COAST LOVE-HOUNDS WILL BE HAVING A PARTY TO
CELEBRATE THE NEW ALBUM ON SUNDAY, OCTOBER 22ND, AT LARRY HERNANDEZ'S
PLACE IN SAN JOSE. DETAILS WILL FOLLOW SOON (IED HOPES), BUT ALL
INTERESTED PERSONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO ATTEND!! Much fun was had at
Tracy's party on Katemas (last July 30), and with a new album and
video guaranteed for the 22nd festivities, even more fun can be
expected this time.
