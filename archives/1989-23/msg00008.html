Creek exit.  It is a right turn loop off of 17, *before* 17 turns into
I-880 toward Oakland.  Once on Stevens Creek, you'll pass Valley Fair 
shopping center (on your right). After Valley Fair, the light is 
Winchester.  The very next light up (approx. 1/2 mile or so) is CYPRESS.
Turn left on Cypress (there is a 7-11, a Jack-in-the-Box, a carpet store,
and First Nationwide Bank [I believe] on the intersection of Stevens 
Creek and Cypress).  After turning left onto Cypress, take the second 
right, which is JUDRO.  You'll pass a senior citizen's apartment building
on your right.  The first entrance to the condo complex is Boxleaf Court
(there is a green sign that says Boxleaf Ct).  Turn into Boxleaf Court and
go down to the end to park (if there are any spaces left).  If not, you'll
have to go back out and park on the street.  My place is the last condo 
on the right, above three garages.  Just listen for the heavenly sounds of
God; you can't miss it. 

For those coming down 280 toward San Jose: 

Take the SARATOGA RD exit, and turn left onto Saratoga.  Stevens Creek 
will be two or three lights after you turn left.  At Stevens Creek, turn 
RIGHT.  The first light is San Tomas Expressway, and Cypress is the 
light after that.  Turn RIGHT onto Cypress, and refer to the directions 
above. 

For those coming down 880 (From Berkeley/Oakland): 

I believe the exit after Bascom exit is Stevens Creek exit. Once you're
on Stevens Creek, proceed past Valley Fair, Winchester, etc.. 

For those coming up 280 from 101:

Take the "Oakland-880" turnoff right, but just before hitting 880, take
the Stevens Creek exit loop (which is the SECOND Stevens Creek exit-this
goes for you Santa Cruz people coming up 17.Remember-you need to take 
the Stevens Creek exit that makes a right loop.  If you take the first 
one by mistake, simply make a U-turn). 

I know these directions may sound more complicated than theyreally are:
it's not really hard to get here.  Call if lost! 

Iwill supply some burgers and condiments, and of course the champagne and
some beer.  You are welcome to bring anything else to eat, or maybe just 
bring money-we can always hit the Safeway down at Winchester for any needed
supplies.  I have a VHS and an 8mm VCR and camcorder and 25" television and
stereo system.  IED is bringing his beta deck and posters and extra TV to 
set up in the bedroom for anyone who wishes to watch the fantastic 
_The Sensual World_ video over and over again or whatever.  Almost EVERY 
single minute of Kate on video existing in the world will be available for
your viewing pleasure, and of course the Album of The Year on compact disk.
Kate boots, literature, the brand new _TSW_ poster, the rare _TKI_ poster, 
Cathy Demos EPs, you name it.  

tracy reports that Love-Hound eKsTaordinaires Corey, Ed, Michael from 
Apple, Julian, Stew, and others will be joining she, me, and IED.  I hope
you can come, too!  It'd be nice if you could send me a note if you plan 
to attend.  That's Larry_Joe_Hernandez@cup.portal.com  

Oh!  I'm not sure if someone is bringing a laserdisk player so that we 
further analyze Kate's videos and films.  As far as I can tell right now,
that's all we need as far as hardware.  I Kan'T wait!!  

And to those of you who can't make a party in your area: Just put your new
CD or record or tape of the new album on, and know that we join you in 
spirit.  We are all very special people. 

Yours in Kate, Larry 

KTISGOD.
