In rec.music.gaffa you write:

&gt;Really-From: cheung@eniac.seas.upenn.edu (rich)

&gt;I've been reading this group for over a year now, and like most of you
&gt;out there, I, too, believe Kate is god.  However, even gods are not
&gt;perfect and her mistake happens to be ............. The Dreaming.  I
&gt;can't understand what you people see or hear in this album. I don't
&gt;even consider it music - it's that bad.  As a side note, I think HoL
&gt;is THE BEST.

&gt;     [ Repent, sinner!  Repent! *The Dreaming* is the one true word of
&gt;       God.  If you don't see this then you have obviously let Modonna
&gt;       into your soul.  You have been lured by evil.  Forsake evil!
&gt;       Forsake Madonna, who wants your imortal soul damned forever.
&gt;       Accept *The Dreaming* as the one true word of God and achieve
&gt;       eternal life.  Repent before it is too late.  Repent!  Repent!
&gt;       -- |&gt;oug ]

Take it easy on the guy, |&gt;oug.  I, too, once thought that The Dreaming
was total trash (please, no flames!).  Let me explain...

A little while after Hounds of Love had come out I decided to go out
and get the album since I liked a couple of the songs I had heard off of it.
I also decided to pick up The Dreaming since everyone here said it was 
Kate's best work.  After listening to it I thought I had just thrown away 
my money.  I couldn't see any redeeming value in TD.  I decided that Hol 
wasn't a total loss since I liked a couple of the song off of it.  After 
letting the albums sit on the shelf for a month or so I decided to give 
them a second chance.  Still nothing.  After the third or fourth time 
though...Wow!  I thought someone must have switched albums on me because 
I couldn't believe that I hadn't heard it all the first few times!
I then went out and picked up everything else I could find by Kate and I've 
been hooked ever since.

Give it a couple of more tries Rich.  I'm sure you will see the light.

-Mike
