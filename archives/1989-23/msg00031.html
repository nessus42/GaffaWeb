Although my news server was working for a few hours this afternoon, it is
not working right now.  Therefore, I am posting somewhat blind.  I just
couldn't wait to tell you this news, so I'm just hoping that nobody has 
posted this within the last few hours.

There's a short article on Kate in the "Random Notes" section of the
November 2 issue of _Rolling Stone_.  (Finally!  I was wondering when
they'd notice.)  Here's what it says:
    
    "I'd like to think that some of the songs could be of some comfort if
anyone's having a hard time," says KATE BUSH, whose new album, _The
Sensual World_, is just out.  "Each song is a scenario in a way, a short
story."
    It's been four years since Bush has released an album of new material
-- she did release a compilation album in 1986 -- but it's been even
longer since she's toured.  "My touring situation is a little unusual,
to say the least," she says.  "I've only ever done one tour, and that was
ten years ago, and since then I've only concentrated on albums.  I much 
enjoyed the tour.  But touring is just re-creating music that already
exists."
    Perhaps because she doesn't tour, Bush, who's a major star in England,
has never reached as broad an audience in the U.S.  "It doesn't really
upset me," she says.  "I've never seen making an album in terms of 
sweeping the market."

There's also a picture of her with sand running through her fingers.  It's
not really a very good picture, in my opinion (she's got kind of a long
face), but it's in color, at least.

I'm interested in what _RS_ has to say about the album.  Her reviews have
never been that great in this magazine.  They gave a terrible review to
_The Kick Inside_, and their review of _Hounds of Love_ was one of the few
that was not wholly favorable.  Yet in the last few years, she's been used
as an example of a great artist.  For example, in the Sinead O'Connor
review, Kate is called one of the female artists "breaking down the walls
of pop music," and in an article on Jane Siberry, Jane is said to have
"the offbeat charm of Kate Bush."  So we'll see.

It appears that I now can get UUNET to work. So feel free to write to me.
