I've got a couple of things.  First, there's a review of the videos
in _The Laser Disc Newsletter_, June 1990.  I haven't actually seen
the laser disc, but I guess it must exist.  The reviewer (who is 
unnamed) talks about how the 8-inch is back again, and says:

     "The best of the lot is _The Sensual World Kate Bush The Videos_.
Although the source material is mildly grainy, the sound is clear and the
presentation is sufficiently effective.  Each number is preceded by an
interview, but the interruption is low key and not a real problem.  
Bush's music is free of stress and less cliched than her earlier
efforts.  [?!]  She is finally using folk motifs as a light spice in
her compositions, instead of employing them as the main meal.  The videos,
'Love and Anger,' 'The Sensual World,' and 'This Woman's Work' are well
crafted, compelling the viewer to pay attention without a bombardment of
conflicting images.  The title number is the best, adeptly evoking
Technicolor chromatic designs to depict Bush tripping freely through a
studio set forest."

I've seen criticism of Kate's past work, but I've NEVER seen it
called "cliched"!

Next, _Option_ had a cover story on Kate a few months back.  In the
issue which just came out (Jul./Aug. 1990), there's a letter, right
under a picture of Kate that takes up a third of the page.  (Not one
we haven't seen before, unfortunately.)  Here's the letter:

Dear Option:
    I can't thank you enough for Maria Montgomer Sarnoff's lengthy,
illuminating piece on Kate Bush in the March/April issue of OPTION.
I've grown accustomed to reading nothing more than the occasional
"blurb" about this gifted artist who has been in the business long
enough to deserve the sort of exposure that other, less talented artists
seem to enjoy.  And to see her gracing your cover, no less -- I'm
beyond gratitude!
     What Kate Bush has brought to the world of music stretches way 
beyond the realm of conventional art.  It's a whole psychology of images
and feelings -- an unparalleled talent which, I fear, has perhaps
hindered rather than helped her throughout her modest career -- her
emotional accessibility makes people uncomfortable and therefore makes
her unpopular.  And yet, it is precisely Bush's ability to concretize
the feeling values of all levels of the human experience that make her the
sacred swan she is.
     Thank you, OPTION, for recognizing this too, and bringing such a
great artist to light!
     Sincerely,
     Julie K. Dzengeleski
     Wollaston, MA

Wow!  As I said, there's a picture of Kate above this letter.  The caption
reads, "Sacred swan?  Well, a bird in the hand . . ."

That's it for now.
