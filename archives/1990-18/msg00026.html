The June 29 issue of _Goldmine_ has some interesting items.
First of all, there's a review of _Aspects of the Sensual World_
in Bruce Eder's _CDs_ column:

     Kate Bush _Aspects Of The Sensual World_ (CBS promo 44K 73174):
A five-song promo release, featuring the album and instrumental backing
tracks versions of "The Sensual World", "Be Kind To My Mistakes" from
_Castaways_, "Ken" from the comic strip film, "G.L.C." and "I'm Still
Waiting."  A very nice collector's piece.  *****

Next, a while ago I posted about this guy Michael Wehrmann who advertises
in _Goldmine_ occassionally.  He sells autographed items, and at the top
of his ad, he always says, "all autographs were obtained in person by me,
not through the mail or purchased from other dealers."  He always has
photos of him with artists in the corners, as "proof" that he actually
met them.  In my last posting on this subject, I mentioned that he
suddenly got some Kate things, after years of not having any.

In this issue, he again has an ad, on page 29.  He still has some Kate
items.  But the thing I wanted to mention is that one of the photos --
the one in the lower left corner -- is of him with Kate!  The caption
reads "At the airport with Kate Bush."  That bastard!  He actually got to
meet Kate, but what does he want to do?  He wants to sell her autographs!
And it must have been recently, too, because one of the items is the album
_The Sensual World_.  I'm rather envious.

Finally, someone in Austin is starting a new fanzine or fan club or
something.  Here's the complete ad, from the classified section:

KATE BUSH fans -- Lone Star Lionhearts wants you!  SASE for fanzine
information.  Woof!  P.O. Box 13414, Capitol Station, Austin, TX  78711.

Anybody know who this is?

That's it for now.
