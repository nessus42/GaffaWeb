while wandering the streets of nyc today, i popped into bleecker bob's
on 3rd street and was rewarded with a number of promotional pictures 
taken by john carder bush that were made available with some select
copies of the promo-tsw lp sent to some radio stations. the counter
person told me that the complete set numbers about twenty, but he only
had (for sale) six. he also said that a very few stations got promo
packages with these photos - this i can agree with cos the lp that
wtsc got had none.

had anyone else seen these? when and if i ever get back to potsdam,
i'll gif them for you all (they're black and white) as they're rather
nice - and a few are even stunning.

quick descriptions:

1. the cover of tsw

2. close-up of her face. she's looking above and to the right, which
is also where she's faced (it's a 3/4 shot).

3. a close up of the upper body - probably my favorite of the lot. looks
like she's wearing some kind of silk shirt, but her hair, which is loose
and everywhere, obscures most of it. extremely nice.

4.  peeking out from behind a wall. wearing a flower print shirt.

5. similar to the one that appeared in the rolling stone blurb and in the
nettwork article. straight on though, rather than skewed...

6. looking extremely french, KaTe arches her back for this side shot, 
with her hair up and tied back. she's wearing a long coat of some kind
with her arms crossed behind her back.
