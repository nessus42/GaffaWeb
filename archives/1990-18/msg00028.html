i haven't seen any posts pertaining to this bootleg, so i'll illuminate
you all now that i own a copy of this piece'o'vinyl.
 
the cover is the same black and white "photocopied" photography as the
first album. the photograph is a close-up of KaTe's face laden with makeup
(despite the black and white, the red of the lipstick *still* gleams). one
of her hands is palm-outward underneath her chin and the other is palm-
outward above her forehead (vaguely reminiscent of a mime, perhaps - or
madonna in the vogue video).  i've seen this photo before, but cannot place
where.
 
the back cover shot is the infamous leotard poster ("cos they can see my
tits" i believe is KaTe's quote about it).
 
also, on the record's label, there are two more pictures (one on each side)
from the series that were taken for the cover for _the kick inside_.
 
the record itself has the remainder of the "cathy demos" from the series
of ep singles of that title on side one. side two has what, i believe, is 
the first vinyl availablility of the six demos (as of yet, untitled) that
date from 1976 or 1977, probably from the sessions for _the kick inside_
(verification on that, ied?). and finally, the unmuffed "kashka from baghdad"
is the last track on the second side. 
 
so, the track listing is:
 
	the kick inside
	hammer horror
	feeling like a waltz (incorrectly identified as "a rose growing old")
	keeping me waiting ("keep me waiting" on the sleeve)
	davy (or maybe, "while davy dozed")
	disbelieveing angel
	
	don't push your foot on the heartbrake
	kite
	l'amour looks something like you
	strange phenomena
	scares me sily (mistitled "really gets me going")
	moving
	kashka from baghdad
 
sound qualiTy is fair to good - the hiss that is associated with the cathy
demos from _cathy's album_ disappears on _cathy's album too_ (except on 
the corrected "kashka") and _the kick inside_ demos are very listenable.
 
however, they are very rough in production. much that create those songs'
feel on the album are missing here (background vocals for one thing as well
as some of the instrumentation that appeared later). additionally, they
have a decidedly "light" feel to them as well, mostly due to, again, the
instrumentation. KaTe's vocals seem very different here: very airy, perhaps.
none of the dark tone that pervades _the kick inside_ is to be found here.
some of the demos have alternative lyrics from the official recordings.
 
still, this is a definite must if you haven't already obtained these two
sets of demos. the completed cathy demos are a must for anyone seriously
into KaTe and the _kick inside_ demos are interesting from a development
point of view. i'm not sure how often i'll listen to them, but i am pleased
to have finally heard them.
 
i am disappointed that a few songs (such as KaTe's cover of "brazil" and the
two demos of "babooshka") rumored to appear here didn't, but i suppose buyers
can't be chosers (although it'd be nice if they could!).
