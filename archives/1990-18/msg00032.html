The latest installment of the Love-Hounds Digest contains no less
than FIVE articles that didn't make it onto rec.music.gaffa, for
some reason.  Is there a problem with the software?  One of those
articles was mine, which is why I'm interested.  I'm reposting
all five of those articles.  Hope it works this time.

Gods, he is the *worst* poet of all time.  Are you sure he wasn't
a teenage Vogon, adopted sometime after their initial arrival in
London, perhaps jettisoned for spouting poetry too offensive even
for *them*, and found "in the bushes"?

    When and if you get a response to your request, could I ask the same 
of you?  Either that or tell me who did it for you, so that there's one 
less re-recording.

Thanks,
Ryan

P.S.  I suppose giving Kate credit for my signature file is rather
      redundant to anyone who reads r.m.gaffa

Subject: _Goldmine_, June 29


The June 29 issue of _Goldmine_ has some interesting items.
First of all, there's a review of _Aspects of the Sensual World_
in Bruce Eder's _CDs_ column:

     Kate Bush _Aspects Of The Sensual World_ (CBS promo 44K 73174):
A five-song promo release, featuring the album and instrumental backing
tracks versions of "The Sensual World", "Be Kind To My Mistakes" from
_Castaways_, "Ken" from the comic strip film, "G.L.C." and "I'm Still
Waiting."  A very nice collector's piece.  *****

Next, a while ago I posted about this guy Michael Wehrmann who advertises
in _Goldmine_ occassionally.  He sells autographed items, and at the top
of his ad, he always says, "all autographs were obtained in person by me,
not through the mail or purchased from other dealers."  He always has
photos of him with artists in the corners, as "proof" that he actually
met them.  In my last posting on this subject, I mentioned that he
suddenly got some Kate things, after years of not having any.

In this issue, he again has an ad, on page 29.  He still has some Kate
items.  But the thing I wanted to mention is that one of the photos --
the one in the lower left corner -- is of him with Kate!  The caption
reads "At the airport with Kate Bush."  That bastard!  He actually got to
meet Kate, but what does he want to do?  He wants to sell her autographs!
And it must have been recently, too, because one of the items is the album
_The Sensual World_.  I'm rather envious.

Finally, someone in Austin is starting a new fanzine or fan club or
something.  Here's the complete ad, from the classified section:

KATE BUSH fans -- Lone Star Lionhearts wants you!  SASE for fanzine
information.  Woof!  P.O. Box 13414, Capitol Station, Austin, TX  78711.

Anybody know who this is?

That's it for now.

Subject: Experiment IV secret message
Organization: CWRU Dept of Computer Engineering and Science
Date: Sun, 24 Jun 90 03:10:01 GMT

    I think I may have deciphered the backing vocal in _Experiment IV_
just before the line "But that dream is your enemy" after listening to
the five-second clip only about fifty times (I lost count after 34).

    I believe the  words are "I must thank you for listening to my tune."
There are so many overdubs with varying shifts and volumes that it's hard
to tell right where the main line begins and what is a pre-echo.  

There are still a couple points I'm not quite clear on:

1. There seems to be two sylables of the same volume before the first word 
   in the above sentence.  These could be 
	A) Two real sylables in the same track that add meaning to the
	   sentence.  If this is the case they may be, "I feel,"  yielding,
	   "I feel I must thank you..."
	B) Two 'warm-up' pre-repetitions of, "I", yileding, "I I I must..."
	C) The beginnings of two tracks of the same sentence but with a 
	   negative time shift.

2. The word, "tune" doesn't quite sound right.  There seems to be a ch
   sound between the t and the u, 'tchune'.  Maybe this isn't even the
   the right word.

Here's a graph of words vs. how sure I am of them:

 Pretty darn sure -                         ******************
         Probably -               **********                  **
Maybe - Maybe not -       ********                              *****
         Clueless - ******
		    I  I  I  must thank you for listening to my tune.

    I found that having the 1K, 2K and 4K channels on the equalizer
full-blast and all the rest all the way off gives the best voice-to-
instrumentation ratio.

    I'm going to give it a couple more runs tonight before I go to bed,
but I just had to post these preliminary findings.

From: woj@paladin.Owego.NY.US (caroline wheeler's birthday present)
Subject: _cathy's album too_

i haven't seen any posts pertaining to this bootleg, so i'll illuminate
you all now that i own a copy of this piece'o'vinyl.
 
the cover is the same black and white "photocopied" photography as the
first album. the photograph is a close-up of KaTe's face laden with makeup
(despite the black and white, the red of the lipstick *still* gleams). one
of her hands is palm-outward underneath her chin and the other is palm-
outward above her forehead (vaguely reminiscent of a mime, perhaps - or
madonna in the vogue video).  i've seen this photo before, but cannot place
where.
 
the back cover shot is the infamous leotard poster ("cos they can see my
tits" i believe is KaTe's quote about it).
 
also, on the record's label, there are two more pictures (one on each side)
from the series that were taken for the cover for _the kick inside_.
 
the record itself has the remainder of the "cathy demos" from the series
of ep singles of that title on side one. side two has what, i believe, is 
the first vinyl availablility of the six demos (as of yet, untitled) that
date from 1976 or 1977, probably from the sessions for _the kick inside_
(verification on that, ied?). and finally, the unmuffed "kashka from baghdad"
is the last track on the second side. 
 
so, the track listing is:
 
	the kick inside
	hammer horror
	feeling like a waltz (incorrectly identified as "a rose growing old")
	keeping me waiting ("keep me waiting" on the sleeve)
	davy (or maybe, "while davy dozed")
	disbelieveing angel
	
	don't push your foot on the heartbrake
	kite
	l'amour looks something like you
	strange phenomena
	scares me sily (mistitled "really gets me going")
	moving
	kashka from baghdad
 
sound qualiTy is fair to good - the hiss that is associated with the cathy
demos from _cathy's album_ disappears on _cathy's album too_ (except on 
the corrected "kashka") and _the kick inside_ demos are very listenable.
 
however, they are very rough in production. much that create those songs'
feel on the album are missing here (background vocals for one thing as well
as some of the instrumentation that appeared later). additionally, they
have a decidedly "light" feel to them as well, mostly due to, again, the
instrumentation. KaTe's vocals seem very different here: very airy, perhaps.
none of the dark tone that pervades _the kick inside_ is to be found here.
some of the demos have alternative lyrics from the official recordings.
 
still, this is a definite must if you haven't already obtained these two
sets of demos. the completed cathy demos are a must for anyone seriously
into KaTe and the _kick inside_ demos are interesting from a development
point of view. i'm not sure how often i'll listen to them, but i am pleased
to have finally heard them.
 
i am disappointed that a few songs (such as KaTe's cover of "brazil" and the
two demos of "babooshka") rumored to appear here didn't, but i suppose buyers
can't be chosers (although it'd be nice if they could!).
