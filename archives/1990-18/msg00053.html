&gt;Really-From: nrc@cbema.att.com (Neal R Caldwell, Ii)
&gt;
&gt;As things get strangely quiet here on Love-Hounds I realize that I'm
&gt;having still another new Kate-related experience.  Just as I had never
&gt;experienced the bliss of an new Kate Bush release prior to _The
&gt;Sensual World_ I have never experienced the profound letdown of it
&gt;being "over".

Yes, but wait til you experience the profound letdown of a once-great
artist releasing an album of unlistenable crap.  OF COURSE I'M NOT
TALKING ABOUT KATE, YOU DWEEBS.  (Actually, I was thinking more of
Mike Oldfield, but I don't wanna talk about that.)

&gt;I believe that the increasing involvement of Del Palmer in Kate's work
&gt;did not have a positive affect on _The Sensual World_.  Perhaps even the
&gt;contrary.

Oooh, juicy juicy juicy!  Explain exactly what you mean, please!

&gt;Jorn Barger reports his disappointment at the arrival of a very low
&gt;key official Sensual World T-shirt.  John, where have you been?  Low-key
&gt;seems to be what Kate is all about these days.  

This is one case where the bootleg surpasses the official product.

&gt;of unwashed masses.  Well, unless you count the occasional, "Do you work 
&gt;at Circle K?".

Fortunately, there are no Circle K's here in Massachusetts, so this is
one embarrassment spared us.

&gt;As a couple of people have noted, we may find it easy to ignore
&gt;censorship when it involves groups like 2Live Crew but somewhere
&gt;down that road the censors will be adding _The Infant Kiss_, _Feel It_
&gt;and a host of other great works of art to their bon fires if we let
&gt;them get started.

And what about _The_Sensual_World_?  slipped between my breasts,
indeed!  His *what* took *what* in your *WHAT*???  Slip me the
kerosene, JimBob, we gonna have us an arty english broad BBQ!

&gt;And speaking of Andy someone's query as to what IED stands for is met
&gt;with the usual silence.  A friend of mine to whom I forward
&gt;Love-Hounds and who I'll call Cynthia (because that's her name)
&gt;suggests that it might stand for "In Excelsis Deo".  If that is indeed 
&gt;the meaning of "IED" I leave it the reader to decide how it's intended...

I got an interesting insight into what the DXM part of IED0DXM meant a
while ago.  I always thought IED meant "I'm Extremely Devoted."  (or
"Dialectical")...

&gt;It seems that there have been a couple of people on here asking -- no,
&gt;pleading -- to be taken off the mailing list.  That's all well and
&gt;good but the proper thing to do is note "because I've got access to
&gt;the newsgroup now."

I suppose I should mention that all requests to be added/dropped or
whatever have been cheerfully ignored for some time now and probably
will continue to be.  Dear |&gt;ouglas has been swamped with work from
his new job and has had no time to keep up with l-h.  And now he's on
vacation for a while in Cancun.
