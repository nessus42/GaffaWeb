I think there are other examples of this kind of slight corruption of 
the language to suit her needs though I can't recall them off hand. 
Sometimes the sound of a word is just as important as the word itself.
"Freezed," for example, is a tinny sort of word while "froze" would 
been a nice woody sounding word.  Caribou gooone.

This shows up even more in Kate's background vocals where she is freed 
of of all language constraints and can just create images or moods with 
vocal sounds.
