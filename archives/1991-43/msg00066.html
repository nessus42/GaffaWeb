 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: Alain Stivell and Kate

   IED happened to be around long enough to catch an inquiry
about the announced collaboration between Kate and Alain Stivell,
the Breton folk-cum-New Age musician. Some of you may recall that the
original plan, as bruited about by _Homeground_ and the KBC, was
that Kate had accepted Stivell's offer to produce two tracks for
Stivell's next album.  Then a while later she went to France and
said (so IED has been told) that she was about to go to work on Stivell's
album.
   IED picked up the album in September (during a visit to France), after
seeing that two of the tracks had been co-written by one John Calder &lt;sic&gt;
Bush.  Alas! Upon closer inspection, IED discovered that Kate is
mentioned nowhere in the album's credits, nor is her presence in
any way audible (to this fan) on any of the tracks.  Moreover, in the
cassette version which IED bought, there is no lyric sheet, and since
Stivell's voice is peculiarly accented and far back in the mix, IED
hasn't even been able thus far to transcribe John Carder Bush's
lyrics. Altogether a huge fiasco from a Kate Bush fan's standpoint,
though perhaps Stivell fans will be satisfied. In any event, there
has yet to appear any explanation of the mix-up in the press, Kate-ian
or otherwise.

   Now, Bill, IED really is leaving this site, so please, as soon as
you can, could you re-route his Digests to &lt;abm4@CUNIXA.COLUMBIA.EDU&gt;?
Thanks.
