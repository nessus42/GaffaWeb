If i am a record comapny, doi have the choice of whether or not i label certain
albums, the criteria for labelling, the message on the label, the placement and
size of the label, etc?  That would represent a freedom of choice, would it
not?
	So are the PMRC recommendations a standard that they recommend i 
use for the benefit of parents.  What happens if i don't go along with this
"suggestion".  
	Perhaps the PMRC husbands in the Senat will or won't introduce 
legislation on home taping or digital tape recorders or some other 
issue of financial importance.  At any rate, the No More Censorship Defense
Fund (Dead Kennedy's legal project) and Frank Zappa and others have stated
that this was the implied carrot and stick behind the major labels.  
	For smaller ones, such as the Alternative Tentacles label that
released the Dead Kennedys Frankenchrist album, theycan be sued.  The L.A.
city attorney admitted in print that their hope in filing the suit regarding
the poster in the album (and there was a warning sticker about the poster on
the album) was that even if the band, record comapny, and record pressing
company (which had nothing to do with the poster) won the suit, that one
or more of them would be bankrupted.  This was quoted in a newspaper--either
in L.A. or San Francisco (included with NMSCDF information package), so here
was a local government employee clearly attempting to use intimidation to
curtail legal expression.  
	The question is, what would the PMRC do in the case of independent
record companies (or majors for that matter) that don't follow their 
proposal?  
	Some state legislatures have passed or tried to pass  (i don't know
which or where) laws requiring labels, specifying content and placement and
type of records to be stickered; and some (Maryland, i think was one reported
in a Rolling Stone about a year ago) also added bans on sales of stickered 
records to minors.  
	It has been pointed out that the PMRC and related labelling schemes
are not aimed at (will not cover) country music or opera.  Maybe that's what
kids will go for next.
