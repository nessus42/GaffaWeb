&gt;Hello! God I hate great competition! I had to compete with Michelle Shocked
&gt;on Austin City Limits and The Pogues on Saturday Night Live. Yikes! I set
&gt;my VCR for Michelle but I'll have to wait for the repeat to get The Pogues.
&gt;Plus the fact that it was St. Patrick's Day, I probably only had 10 people
&gt;listening :-( I really don't understand what's with St. Patrick's Day. It
&gt;seems as if half the population of the US uses it as an excuse to go out
&gt;and get drunk and act stupid and pose a menace to the rest of us! Hey, I'm
&gt;part Irish (really, I know everybody says that on St. Patrick's Day, but I
&gt;really am!) and I don't feel obligated to get drunk. It's all so silly. Hey
&gt;Declan, what do they do in Ireland on St. Patrick's Day? Do you all wear
&gt;green? I'm proud to say that I didn't wear a speck of green Saturday!

Well, everyone dresses up as a leprechaun and spends the whole day getting
outrageously drunk on green Guinness  (JOKE !)  :-) :-) :-).
Actually, I think celebrations at home are fairly muted in comparison to
those in the US. I have to say that I often cringe when I see the antics 
of so-called Irish-Americans around the time of St. Patricks Day. It can be
a bit of a pain to see all the old stereotypes being wheeled out again.

(By the way, which part of you is Irish ? :-) )

Anyway, I spent my St. Patricks night at a Stiff Little Fingers gig, and
rather good it was too, even if the guys are getting on a bit for the type
of music they play :-)  Anybody else out there remember SLF ? 


&gt;                -------------------------------------

&gt;Macalla is a group of 23 women from Ireland. That's all I know because a
&gt;friend sent me a tape and he doesn't know anything else about them either.
&gt;It's very excellent Irish music, both vocally and instrumentally. I'm not
&gt;sure about the title of the album because the "M" in Mna could be an "N".
&gt;It's hard to read.

You are right. Also the title means "Women Of Ireland", by the way. An apt
song for the day and the program format.


Bye For Now
