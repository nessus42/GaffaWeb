jane smallberries says:
&gt; Those folks from Silicon Graphics sure start up some neat
&gt; stuff.  I'm just waiting for the Cocteau Twins mailing list now
&gt; (perhaps a new album would help).

i've been in touch with the folks at 4ad in new york and sheri
hood has informed me that a new album is coming sometime (and 
that there might even be a tour in the fixings, but nothing is
definite on that yet...).

i'm calling her again monday to find out more juicy details so
hang in there - i'll let all you folks know...

also, there is a twins fanzine in the workings adn i post here
the info that i got from the one who is organizing it...

Dear 4.A.D Fans,

As many of you already know from my ads in Goldmine, I am starting a
fan club for the 4.A.D label in general and the Cocteau Twins in particular.
This letter is to let you know a little bit more about what I plan to do. First
a little bit about me: I'm a graduate student in astrophysics at UCLA and I've
just finished classwork meaning that I have somewhat more free time to
devote to non-academic things. I've been rather heavily into record
collecting for a while and eventually came across the 4.A.D label through
their best band (in my opinion anyway) the Cocteau Twins. The idea of a fan
club is long overdue; I know of none for either Cocteau Twins or 4.A.D.
One day a few months ago I came up with the idea of forming one. I figure
the main functions of the club should be to form a group of friends who
share a common interest, to keep everyone up to date with the latest 4.A.D
news, to share opinions and materials relating to 4.A.D and the Cocteau
Twins, and just to have fun! My plan is to put out a fanzine quarterly (maybe
more often) that will feature letters, reviews, articles, news,
discographies, and artwork. So right now I'm calling for submissions -
letters with ideas for the club, reviews of your favourite record, stories
about when you got to see the Cocteau Twins perform live (any of you that
lucky?!), what you think Liz Fraser is singing about, want lists, or pretty
much anything. Among other things, the first issue(s) will include a survey,
4.A.D discography and checklist, Cocteau Twins discography (larger than you
might think!), some rare 4.A.D items I found extra copies of that I'm selling,
a couple of wantlists, and a review of a wonderful new Vaughan Oliver
(v.23) art exhibition booklet. Perhaps most importantly - what's in this
newsletter depends to a large extent on what you submit. What would you
most like to see (besides Liz, Robin, and Simon performing in your
hometown)?
Issue One of Dewdrops will be out by May or June. The cost per issue I
haven't worked out yet, but it will be around $1 to cover copying and
postage. This letter is the first mailing en masse  concerning the fan club
and there will be one more progress report before the first issues are
mailed, probably sometime in April to give you an update. I may correspond
with some of you individually before then. I am going to write to Ivo Watts-
Russel (4.A.D. founder) and Capitol Records soon to let them know about the
club, and to see if there's any recent 4.A.D/Cocteau news.
Finally, for anyone who has access to a computer account that can send
electronic mail, my address is nelson@uclastro or nelson@astro.ucla.edu
(whichever works.)

Yours truly,
Brant Nelson
