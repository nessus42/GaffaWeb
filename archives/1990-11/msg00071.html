 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: KATE BUSH--A LIST OF THE COMPLETE KNOWN MUSICAL WORK

     Here, for those trying to compile a list of their personal
_Whole_Story_, or simply for the enjoyment of Love-Hounds everywhere,
is a list of every musical item ever recorded, or known to have been
performed, by Kate Bush. The list includes all her own songs, plus all
covers of other people's songs with which she is associated. The latter
have been marked with an asterisk (*). IED has tried to list just about
every title he can think of, whether it was ever released or not, whether
any fan has ever heard it or not. This includes tracks like _Ibiza_ (an
unreleased song written with Peter Gabriel), _Rocket_Man_ (a never-released
Elton John cover), the Seiko Watch commercial music and Japanese folksong
(both still untraced), and the early live pub performances of songs like
_Honky_Tonk_Women_ and _Satisfaction_. IED has also mentioned when more
than one version of a title is known (or known of), though in many cases
the comment "many versions" refers to the various Tour of Life performances
Kate gave of her songs. If anyone can think of omissions, please list them.
