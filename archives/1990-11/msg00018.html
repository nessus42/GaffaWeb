Vickie here. I really hate the Academy Awards, really I do. I used to love
them but they've made me mad* too many times. I do love movies though so
this is my annual "Filmsongs" show. It should be noted that a few of my
choices are from films or soundtracks that I wouldn't recommend, I just
love the songs.
I'm not a purist. Some of the songs are covers of songs that appeared
in films, some are earlier versions of songs that appeared in films years
later, some were recorded for the film but didn't were not in the released
version and there's even one song about a character in a movie (Leory, about
the creepy groundskeeper in the movie "The Bad Seed", sung from the point of
view of the murderous little girl).

That's all I had time for and I still had a lot of things I didn't get to.
I guess this needs a part 2, too. Some of the above films are among my
favorites, but others (um...Springtime In The Rockies for example) I haven't
even seen. 

* last year the people who put on the Awards chose not to have the nominated
songs sung (even though there were only three) and cheated billions of 
people around the world out of hearing one of the greatest songs of all time.
Jevetta Steele's "Calling You". I didn't expect it to win (no one saw the
movie, why would they vote for the song?) but at least it should have gotten
*heard*!! It's just about the only worthwhile thing on the soundtrack so I
couldn't recommend buying the whole thing. I have to say though, knowing 
that (I had a promo cassette), I still bought the CD just for that one song!
