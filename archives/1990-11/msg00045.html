&gt; If an administrator doesn't set the permissions for moderated groups so
&gt; that users can't write to the group, then the note passes through the
&gt; network until it hits a site running News.  At this point, the site will
&gt; spot that the article is for a moderated group, and redirect it to the
&gt; moderator via mail.                                 ^^^^^^^^

&gt; In the case of rec.music.gaffa however, the moderator doesn't manually
&gt; sift the submissions much these days (too busy a life), so the group itself
&gt; receives n-million duplicate copies; as has happened just recently.

Since I told everyone all they had to do was post, that's my fault. Sorry!
I still don't understand WHY .gaffa can't be unmoderated!
What's the problem with just passing the word around to the various
sites that rec.music.gaffa is *no longer* moderated?

&gt;&gt;   Furthermore, at least half of the serious contributors to Love-Hounds
&gt;&gt;   only receive the digest and do not have access to UseNet.
&gt;&gt;   Furthermore, it's the gatewaying between the mailing list and newsgroup
&gt;&gt;   that is the hardest thing to maintain, and if I was going to cancel
&gt;&gt;   one of them, it would be the newsgroup -- not the mailing list.

All this talk about USENET prompted me to go into our files
and dig this out. I've (obviously) cut out hundreds of newsgroups, but I
left a few in to show perspective on where .gaffa is in the scheme of
things. This was in the files at World, our site.

There were dozens more after .gaffa so we're not anywhere near the
bottom of the ladder.

Estimated 11,000 readers worldwide huh? A lot of you sure are keeping quiet!

Speaking of USENET users, here's an excerpt from a letter I received
from Andreas Siivo (the NICE! guy from eastern Finland-I hope you don't
mind this Andreas-btw,everyone, I did get through to him via e-mail!). 

&gt; I could ever have imagined. I think that she really is a great genius,
&gt; BETTER than any Mozart, Beethoven, Bach etc. far more better, she is
&gt; the best composer ever. It is really nice to read rec.music.gaffa when
&gt; people have similar feelings and ideas. A guy told that "The Dreaming
&gt; is the album *I* *love* *every* *song*", it is nice to listen that.
&gt; Also stories about finding Kate are really nice to read.

&gt; Last fall I noticed that a guy was reading rec.music.gaffa that I had
&gt; found from the club-magazine. I learned to use news and here I write.
&gt; I learned to read news only because of rec.music.gaffa
  ^ ^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^

Yeah, ditto for Chris &amp; I

The Fellow Who Supplies Homeground writes in response to Doug's posting
reprinted earlier in this post:

&gt;    So if we're not in that petite coterie, we are to be denied all of the
&gt;    informative, educational, entertaining, and infuriating aspects of
&gt;    r.m.g.? I rely entirely on the USENET for gaffa, and, as I print out all
&gt;    the Kate related postings and mail them to Homeground each month, so do
&gt;    they (that's why Love-Hounds now gets a credit in the news section of
&gt;    each issue). I would appreciate it if we could be advised on what's
&gt;    happening to the group as soon as the new arrangements are confirmed.

Peter writes:

&gt;  As one of the 139 in the "petite coterie" who only see gaffa postings
&gt; via the Love-Hounds Digest on the INTERNET, I much appreciate Doug's
&gt; concern for us.  At the same time, jim%BILPIN.UUCP has a point too,
&gt; especially if it has been USENET that made possible the highly stimulating
&gt; international participation at gaffa.


Eric writes:

&gt; I too rely on netnews for my gaffa, so I would not like to see the
&gt; connection between r.m.g. and the mailing list (Love-Hounds?) sundered.

Derek writes:

&gt; Just my luck! I'm in touch with the love-hounds for less than a week
&gt; and find out it may not last much longer.  Please don't let it die!


There were more but you get the gist.


***  rec.music.gaffa is TOO IMPORTANT to become "just" a mailing list. ***
