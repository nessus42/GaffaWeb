Vickie here. I figure Dave has gotten lots of e-mail responses so I
won't go into too much detail.

\ Hello! I have just finished listening to the tapes "The Sensual World",

Hello yourself! Get everything on CD, put on headphones and enter bliss!
Get to know the music, everything else (lyrics, "meanings" etc.) will follow
in natural order.

&gt; I certainly agree from first listening that Kate Bush deserves her own
&lt; newsgroup for discussion.  I've also seen postings re: Peter Gabriel and
&gt; Sinead.  Who is included in "gaffa" whatever that is? is there a loose or
&lt; strict definition?

We're all music lovers in this group, and we have "roughly" the same tastes
in music (occasional exceptions, of course) so we sometimes talk about other
artists that we think might be of interest to readers.

&gt; Is there a culture or personality linked to liking/following KB's music and
&lt; actions? e.g. Deadhead and Jimmy Buffet's Parrotheads each have distinctive
&gt; cultures.

I don't know, I just know that I've never met a true Katefan that I didn't
like and that I didn't have at least a few things in common with. Love of
music and female vocals and an interest in lyrics, for example.
Katefans are an eclectic bunch and are always interesting people to know
and be around. Anyone who has the intelligence and sensitivity to like Kate
Bush is pretty cool in my book.

ALL Kate Bush fans have:

1) Open ears--to HEAR it
2) Open minds--to KNOW it
3) Open hearts--to FEEL it

And, despite what the folks in rec.music.misc think, we've got great
senses of humor too! (Well, IED doesn't, but his alter-ego "Andy" does)

&gt;  Will she be touring in Philadelphia or NYC in the near future?

No, IMHO  :-(    :-(    :-(    :-(    :-(    :-(   she'll never tour again,
but you just missed her being in NYC promoting The Sensual World (aka TSW)

"gaffa" question answered in another post

Welcome to the wonderful world of Kate Bush!
Have LOTS of fun!!
