 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick
 Subject: MisK.

     First, welcome Mike Weaver! Mike is the veteran (and
distinguished) Kate fan who posted the extremely funny list of
censorable Kate Bush songs (how anyone could have failed to see
the humor of that posting is beyond even IED, whose sense of
humor is notoriously weak).
     Andy Semple, our new UK Love-Hound: thanks for all your
informative postings to date, and PLEASE could you consider
transcribing and posting to the group the recent print interview
that appeared in _The_Daily_Mirror_? IED realizes that it is
probably mostly familiar material, but even one single line
of new information from Kate's lips is highly valued here...

 &gt;  Can anyone tell me what I should expect to pay for a copy of the
 &gt;_Cathy_Demos_ record?  Wheren't there two of these such recordings.  I
 &gt;can't remember the details from the discussion I read about nine or ten
 &gt;months ago.  What is the going price now?
 &gt;
 &gt;-Brian

   There have been at least three volumes of seven-inch records
in the ongoing series of bootleg _Cathy_Demos_ series. The first
contains four tracks, the second five, and the third has six tracks.
That leaves seven more tracks still to be put out by this group of
bootleggers--the original tape which is the source of the "Cathy"
material contained a total of twenty-two songs, seventeen of which
had never been heard in any form before.
   These EPs were originally released in color-vinyl editions of
600 copies each, and they went for between $12 and $25 each. The
first volume was in red vinyl, the second was in green, and the
third was in yellow. The covers were uniform in layout (black ink
on plain white sleeves), but each had a detail from a different
John Carder Bush black-and-white photo-portrait of Kate as a little
girl, badly reproduced (without permission) from his book, _Cathy_.
   Now, IED has been told (thanks, Mike Butler), at least the first
volume of these _Cathy_Demos_ EPs has been re-pressed in a new
edition on plain black vinyl, in larger quantities than the original
pressing. IED has not seen any of these yet, but their reported
existence indicates that the original color-vinyl editions will
indeed maintain their current inflated prices (which now range
from anywhere between $15 and $60 per unit).
   However, do not despair. Not only are at least 140 current and/or
former Love-Hounds _known_ to have all these demos in at least
some form or other (say no more!); but the entire collection of
twenty-two demos has now been re-released by _another_ bootlegging
outfit (this one definitely U.S.-based) on a pair of albums; and
these have been showing up at record swapmeets recently. The
sound quality of these is arguably a bit worse than that of the
EPs, but it is still quite acceptable, and the price of the LPs
is considerably lower than that of the EPs--which, unlike the LPs, have
still not formed a complete series, as far as IED is aware. Also,
the second LP, which Ed Suranyi recently posted a description of,
is reported to contain _more_ than just the rest of the 22 original
"Cathy" demos, making the albums an even better value.
     Of course, all of these recordings are illegal and unauthorized,
and their purchase is strongly discouraged...
     A note about Love-Hounds's future: IED deplores the ill-considered
suggestions that Love-Hounds be made an "unmoderated" newsgroup. Doug
can scarcely be described as a censor of the contributors' language
or thought, now, can he? The purpose in having a "Pseudo-Moderator"
is, as IED understands it, to have one person in charge of re-routing
the mail so that both rec.music.gaffans and Digesters can participate
in a relatively timely and well organized way. Doug has done a great job
(except during his very occasional lapses in interest and periodic
absences) of keeping us all organized and united. Also, as he just
pointed out, at least half of the current "serious" participators
in Love-Hounds discussions depend upon the Digest for their access
to the group's postings--if either forum for Love-Hounds is more
expendible than the other, it would be the rec.music.gaffa side,
not the Digest. For this reason we _need_ to have someone in charge, and
IED proposes that we place our faith in Doug's plan to find a suitably
computer-literate and dediKated replacement for himself when he leaves.
     IED also objects to the proposal that Love-Hounds be abandoned
for some hypothetical new group dedicated to Kate. There is nothing
wrong with the present group, and it's a hell of a lot better
organized, as well as being quite widely known by Kate fans throughout
the Kate-speaking world (thanks to a series of mentions in _Homeground_,
_Dreamtime_, _Watching_Storms_, the _Kate_Bush_Club_Newsletter_ and
other Kate fora).

 &gt;How many EP's to The Sensual World are available now?
 &gt;
 &gt;Clarkg @ I.U.

     There have been three UK EPs (12-inches and CD-singles,
actually), and one U.S. CD-single called _Aspects_of_the_Sensual_
_World_.
     The first UK CD-single/12" contained _The_Sensual_World_,
_The_Sensual_World_(Instrumental)_ and _Walk_Straight_Down_the_Middle_.
     The second UK CD-single/12" contained _This_Woman's_Work_(single
mix)/_Be_Kind_to_My_Mistakes_(1989 re-mix)/_I'm_Still_Waiting_.
     The third and latest UK CD-single/12" contains _Love_and_Anger_/
_Ken_/_The_Confrontation_/_One_Last_Look_Around_the_House_Before_We_
_Go_...
     If you're seeking the cheapest way of getting everything on CD,
you need buy only the CD of the album plus the U.K. CD-single of
_Love_and_Anger_ and the new (very reasonably priced) U.S. CD-single,
_Aspects_of_the_Sensual_World_. In this way you would be getting
every track except the "single mix" of _This_Woman's_Work_ from the
UK _TWW_ CD-single/12"--no great loss, since the change in this
mix is extremely minor, consisting mainly of a slight push forward
for the lead vocal and the bass in the mix. Unfortunately the one
remaining track related to the LP--the original soundtrack mix of
_Be_Kind_to_My_Mistakes_--is still not available on CD.

 &gt;  I rely entirely on the USENET for gaffa, and, as I print out         all
 &gt;  the Kate related postings and mail them to Homeground each month, so do
 &gt;  they (that's why Love-Hounds now gets a credit in the news section of
 &gt;  each issue). I would appreciate it if we could be advised on what's

     Relax, jim@bilpin, :&gt;oug didn't say he _was_ dropping r.m.g.,
just that the Digest is at least as important. As for your claim of
being singlehandedly responsible for _HG_'s awareness of Love-Hounds,
that's just not true. Ed Suranyi has been keeping Peter informed
and up-to-date for many months now, and IED has kept in regular
contact with Peter as well. Which is not to say that the printouts
you have been sending him are superfluous or go unappreciated,
for no doubt they increase L-Hs's recognition-factor greatly.
It's just that you're not Love-Hounds's Messiah overseas!
     Doug Parker: the live CD you mention is an excellent bootleg
transfer (digital-to-digital, IED thinks) from the Japanese digitally
remixed edition of the _Live_at_Hammersmith_Odeon_ laser-disk. The
first twelve tracks are from that source, and the sound is superb.
Also included are a couple of other previously available but uncollected
KT tracks, and it's nice to have them all on one CD. But $50 is a
grossly inflated price. It shouldn't cost more than $30 (and $20
is more reasonable) at a record swapmeet, though that will take
some time and searching...

&gt;C'n'V: Seems you're theory is blown out of the water (or should that be gaffa?

   Well, Vickie, you sort of set yourself up for that one, IED is
afraid. Having read a huge backlog of Love-Hounds from before your
time, however, you were probably prepared for the backlash on the
dreaded subject of Gaffa!
   IED merely wants to comment that, while the word indeed refers
to gaffer's tape (there is no reason to assume that Kate lied
on this point), it clearly means something _else_, as well. Or
more accurately, it refers to a _larger_ idea (the concept of
purgatory, or limbo), as well. In other words, all of you are correct!
     IED would caution Love-Hounds not to assume that because Kate
_has_ lied (or distorted the facts) on a handful of occasions, she
is _not_ "a liar". Too much has been made recently in this group
about the extremely limited number of documented occasions on
which Kate has definitely "lied". For the most part she is an
exceptionally honest and truthful interviewee.

-- Andrew Marvick
   Hail :&gt;oug for his extraordinary dediKation over the last
five years (that's right, isn't it, :&gt;oug--Love-Hounds is just
now approaching its fifth anniversary, no?) as Pseudo-Moderator
of Love-Hounds. IED is truly grateful to you for all your patient
work and for your extraordinary tolerance of IED's many (shall
we say argumentative?) contributions. Thanks very much for
everything, and best wishes to you in your future endeavors. Also,
IED hopes that, though you may no longer serve as P-M of L-Hs,
you will still remain as a reading and contributing philocanine
for many years to come.
