&gt;I received the latest mag from the KBC, and I can't say I'm overly impressed.
&gt;It's the usual bit from Kate,Del and Paddy about the album and mostly nice
&gt;pictures.No merchandise,singles info,competitions just down to basics.I know
&gt;they wanted to change the format,but if that is an example of what is to come
&gt;I don't want any part of it.

&gt;I have just received the latest copy of the KBC magazine - the Red Shoes
&gt;Issue. It is packed with great photos mostly colour but some B&amp;W. I know
&gt;some people will not have received theirs yet so I wont spoil if for them
&gt;by giving too much away.
&gt;I will just say that there are articles by Kate, Del, Paddy and Stuart
&gt;Arnold. Lots of stills from The Line, The Cross, The Curve and a pull-out
&gt;supplement with swaps etc. that opens up into a calendar with a great
&gt;photo of Kate.
&gt;
&gt;Well worth the money!

Just to clarify what I meant by "well worth the money" - the mag is
certainly (IMHO) very good value as it contains lots of great photos
of Kate (mostly in colour) which you cannot get anywhere else. The
interviews are worth having as well.

However, I agree with Andy that as a club the KBC leave a lot to be
desired. They seem to be doing less and less and should now only be
viewed as a publised of a magazine - with a 4 yearly publication cycle!
For the latest news and information I rely on Homeground and of course
Lovehounds itself. Even the updates from the KBC seem to be of limited
value (viz. the elusive Des O'Connor TV appearance announcement).

The fact that the KBC has declined to its present state must reflect
what Kate wants to do with the club. Presumably if she wanted it to
be more active then she would be put more effort into it or see
that more active people were involved. Perhaps she thinks Homeground
already fulfill the role of a fan club. With Kate's appearances in
public to promote albums also declining it seems that we are never
likely to see a more prominent KBC appear.
