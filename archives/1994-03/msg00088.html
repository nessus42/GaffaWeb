Hi everyone:
The first thing I want to say is that if you want to reply to this message, 
please email me direct. I have been trying to get on this mailing list 
for the last week or so but nothing seems to be happening. I have gotten 
some of the archives by ftp
and there is some interesting stuff. The selection I got is from around 
the middle of October to the middle of November (specifically, Mail files 
Mail40 through Mail 47).There are several things I would like to comment 
on - please forgive me if these have been discussed already.

One person asked about Lilith being a biblical person (pertaining to 
the song Lily): This is a very interesting idea. Yes, Lilith is biblical 
but it depends on what version of the bible you are reading. What is 
in most bibles is determined by a comittee (usually - actually not usually- 
always, men). If there is something that they feel is subversive in it 
all they have to do us decide that it be excluded and - voila! - its 
gone. From most bibles the story of Lilith is excluded because it is 
very subversive - at least for the time that most bibles derive their 
versions from - somewhere around the 1600's - maybe earlier. Lilith was 
the edenic precursor to Eve. Apparently she did not want to have anything 
to do with Adam and decided to get the hell (no pun intended) out of 
there and live her own life. God was sort of confounded at this and thus 
made Eve out of his rib...blah...blah...blah
Anyhow, that is the story of Liliith - the first feminist

As I have read though these mailing - sometimes with delight, sometimes 
with a frown, sometimes with a yawn - I have been surprised by how many 
people have that Prince collaboration. Before I go on, I will warn you 
- some may get offended by what is to come - flames welcome- remeber 
I am not officially part of the net yet so send direct - encouragement 
welcomed as well. Here goes-
First off - I can't see why people are surprised that Kate and Prince 
have worked together, much less say that they are incompatible. Personally, 
this is my dream date. I have been a Kate fan since about '85, Prince 
since '87. Today I am a bigger Prince fan that Kate - probably just because 
I have enough connections that I am receiving new prince music about 
every two weeks - but thats another story. I don't see how anyone can 
say that Prince and Kate are incompatible. Give me a good reason. Don't 
give me a shit reason. I expect that 90% of the reasons I get are fro 
 from people that are completely uninformed about Prince and what he 
does. Please, Please, Please - do not base your opinions of Prince on 
what you hear on the radio. Even on what you hear on his albums. See 
him live. Listen to some of his unreleased stuff - good starting point 
- the boots Crucial and Crystal Ball and the after shows - Small Club-Secons 
Show that Night and This Is my Night. Prince is a hell of a lot deeper 
than most of you think. Lyrically, I admit, he can be weak. Musically, 
I don't think there is anyone better. Period. 
Continuing this Prince rant that I seem to be on.....some of you have 
seen the light. Specifically, that Constellation of The Heart is Prince 
influenced. I would even go beyond this to say that Prince had something 
directly to do with the track. I know, I know, I know.. He is not mentioned 
in the liner notes. So what. Try and find him in the liner notes of a 
lot of poeple he had worked with lately - namely (of the top of my head) 
Ingird Chavez and Paula Abdul. He's not there. If, however, you go to 
the copyright office and look at who the real writer of the song is you 
will find out that he has written tracks that have been, according to 
the liner notes, written by others. More about COTT and Prince's connection 
to it later.
Before I forget I would like to forward a possible interpretation of 
Song of Solomon, A friend of mine said to me that he heard some people 
talking about the song as if it was directed toward Kate fan(atics):
Is this talking about you?
"Don't want your bullshit, yeah
Just want your sexuality
Don't want your excuses. yeah
Write me your poetry in motion
Write it just for me, yeah
And sign it with a kiss"


Sorry if my implication offends anyone -it wasn't really meant that way 
- well maybe sort of - but I do think it applies to some people here.

Anyway, back to the Kate-Prince connection. As I mentioned before I am 
a big Prince fan (but not big enough to spell before b4). I was really 
freaked out when he decided to change his name to that symbol thing. 
Fortunately, I *think* I have figured out what that thing is. My argument 
that follows will get a little strange at times but I think it all fits 
together in the end. By the way, other than telling a few friends, who 
were very positive about my findings, this is my first publication of 
this idea. Let me go back a bit:
About a year ago a friend of mine, who I had the previous night plaed 
the Prince symbol album for, told me that he had had a dream that night./ 
'
He dreamed that he was in a large white room with Prince and a group 
of small children. One child asked Prince if he was going to go to heaven. 
Prince responded by saying that when he finds the key he will open it 
for "you and me both." At the time I thought nothing of the dream except 
that it was sort of odd. The came the Red Shoes and the pieces fit together.
Here are the pieces:
In 1985 Prince released an album called Around The World In A Day. On 
this album was a song called the ladder. the song is about seeking some 
sort of spirituality. For these purposes I will quote the line "Everybody 
is looking for the ladder."
Kate '93 (from "Top Of The City": "Keep looking for the ladder"
Kate '93 (from "Constellation of The Heart"):"Ohh.. find me the man with 
the ladder."
By the way - the type format of the heart symbol used on Constellation 
of the Heart is the exact - EXACT - as used on Prince's Sign Of The Times 
album
So - Kate and Prince and both talking about looking for the ladder. It 
goes deeper than that however.
Prince (from "7"):And I saw an angel come down unto me/ In her hand she 
holds the very key (editorial note - obviously the key to heaven)
Kate (from COTT): "ohhh, and if you see the woman with the key/ I hear 
she's opening up the doors to heaven."
I think it is either pretty obvious that Prince and Kate are 1)completely 
and utterly on the same wavelength or 2) they are working together
There is a Prince biography (not really a bio but it is hard to classify) 
written by Pers Nilssen. A revised copy just came out which places Kate 
at being at Prince's Paisley Park in either late 91 or early 92 (I don't 
have the exact date but I can get it if someone is interested). 
So comes my epiphany.
The symbol that Prince is now named does now stand for a name - rather 
it is indeed the shape of the key to heaven being talked about in these 
songs - ok, it may kinda be a little stretch but not nearly on the level 
of stretchs that Doug Allan takes (just kidding). 
Lastly (sorry for the message being so long and any spelling mistakes 
- I'm still getting used to this editor), anyhow, lastly I would like 
to remind people that this is a KATE message base. This is not to mean 
that this should be a Kate only base but rather that it takes a special 
sort of person to subscribe to this base. I like to think of Kate fans 
as being open-minded. Unfortunately, I only see that from a small percentage 
of people here. I understand that some people don't like other artists 
(shit, you would all probably freak if you knew I was listening to "The 
Chronic" while composing this) but please no more *your-most-hated-artist* 
sucks type of message.
Thanks (hopefully I will be on the net soon)
Chris
