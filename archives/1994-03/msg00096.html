Although this interview is shorter than I remember, I still feel it
better than the interview that was conducted later that night which
was broadcast throughout North America.  I must admit that I felt
rather embarrassed with the phone-in interview where people (mostly
males) could say "I love you, Kate!"  (a.k.a. "I want to bear your
children and be your personal slave!")  This sort of juvenile
swooning is very unbecoming, degrading and even condescending.  In
my mind, I would not be in the least surprised that it is this sort
of behaviour that turns Kate away from the public, causing her
publicity shyness!  Although we all dream of being famous at some
point in our life, not many of us would feel comfortable with our
peers kissing our feet.
 
Regardless, here is the interview with May Potts from CFNY,
Toronto, Canada.  I tried to transcibe it as best I could, keeping
true to every word but trying to omit any "um's" which are just an
ordinary part of speech.
 
Sorry about the delay!
 
{music cut:  MOP and a very gracious intro on the part of May}
 
MP:  Do you feel comfortable with fame?
 
KB:  Um, in a lot of ways, no, I don't but then I don't really,
um...I think it's how you deal with things.  I feel so honoured to
be in the situation where I'm actually doing what I like and I'm
able to make a living out of it.  And, I know so many people whose
work is not what they would like to do. It's not what they enjoy. 
So I feel extremely lucky and I really hope that I will be able to
continue being creative.  It means a lot to me and I have a great
deal of fun doing it and involving other people in it at the same
time.  And I suppose the thing of trying to make a piece of work as
good as you can and doing your best and feeling that it is worthy
to go out has a lot to do with not wanting to abuse the position I
feel I'm in.  I feel I'm in a very priveledged position.  And I
suppose also that the relationship I have with my work is to me
very important.  I don't abuse it.  I never really wanted to be
famous.  Being famous is not what makes me write music or want to
make albums.  So, although there are some areas that I'm not
comfortable with, there are so many where I am.  And I am so
grateful to be in this position.  It is just a matter of me dealing
with it as best I can.  
 
MP:  So tell us about your film, The Line, The Cross and The Curve.
Does it tie in fairly closely to the original story, The Red Shoes.
 
KB:  Not really to the original story.  I suppose it does hop back
to the fairy story more.  But it's more the idea of working in a
rehearsal studio with a band and suddenly this woman appears in the
room and she tricks me out of my soul but she is represented by
three symbols,  and puts me under a spell which involves the Red
Shoes.  For the rest of the film, I have to try to win back my
Soul.  So it's kind of like a fairy tale that was adapted from the
original one but which sort of turned into a modern fairy tale.  I
guess.

Thomas Brasch, Courtice, Canada.
