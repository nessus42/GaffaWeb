This is the FAQ to rec.music.gaffa and love-hounds, the combined newsgroup
and mailing list about Kate Bush. It is posted around the twenty-fifth of every
month.

This FAQ belongs into the public domain and I hereby declare I have no right
at all to stop anyone from posting this text if I ever lose the ability
or desire to post it by myself. The only thing I require is that any future
maintainer will declare this too. If you want to quote anything from it
outside of anything connected with love-hounds or rec.music.gaffa you have
to give the source (i.e. love-hounds or rec.music.gaffa).

The only person whom I grant the right to interfere with the above paragraph
is Ron Hill as the author of a lot of this. Ron, are you around? I want to
remove this line.

1.   General

1.1. What is rec.music.gaffa?

     8 years ago |&gt;oug /\lan thought it was time to create a discussion
     round about Kate Bush and her absolute artistic genius. At first it
     was 'only' a mailing list, but it soon resulted in a usenet newsgroup.
     The name "Gaffa" comes from "Suspended in Gaffa", a song on the album
     "The Dreaming", and refers to gaffer's tape (that's what Kate says).
     Gaffer's tape (or duct tape) is used to stop people from stumbling
     over cabling.

     The name 'r.m.gaffa' was preferred over 'r.m.katebush' to indicate that
     discussion is not limited to Kate. Sometimes this gets too much, but
     what to do in a four years gap between albums? Other artists discussed
     here include various female alternative artists as well as Kate related
     people like Peter Gabriel or Roy Harper.

        "Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
         It all goes slo-mo
         I don't know why I'm crying
         Am I suspended In Gaffa?"

1.2. What is Love-Hounds?

     Love-Hounds is the mailing list version of rec.music.gaffa for those
     people who do not have usenet access. This means that anyone with the
     ability to send and receive mail can take part. |&gt;oug /\lan, founder
     of Love-Hounds, did only later provoke the people on rec.music.misc
     to let him create rec.music.gaffa. Together, the mailing list and r.m.g.
     form an informal fan club called "Love-Hounds."

     To post something to both, the mailing list and the newsgroup, you best
     send an email to

        love-hounds@uunet.UU.NET

     If you think you want to be on the safe side you might want to subscribe
     to the mailing list as well as to the newsgroup, because minor problems
     with the software might cause some messages lost on one of the sides.
     (This hasn't happened for a long while now.)

     To subscribe to Love-Hounds you should send a friendly mail to Bill
     Wisner, the "moderator" of the list. Send it to

        love-hounds-request@uunet.UU.NET

     and specify whether you want bounce mail (every single message is
     forwarded to you) or 24h digests (all messages of a day are packed
     into one mail).

     You can also subscribe by using other networks: America OnLine,
     Compuserve, MCI-Mail, FidoNet, SprintMail, GENIE, Peacenet, Prodigy,
     Bix, Envoy-100, Connect, and others. You might have to find out how
     to reach the Internet. On Compuserve this works by adding "&gt;INTERNET:"
     in front of the addresses.

     Richard Caldwell, a fellow Love-Hound, gives you access via the Big Sky
     BBS, 24 hours a day at 614-864-1198 (up to 14.4k baud). Only charge
     is your phone bill for a long distance call.

     Another Kate-related BBS is The Electronic Cafe at
     1-805-399-3636. A Kate-related BBS in Canada called Night Scented
     Stock, run by the former editor of the fanzine Still Breathing. It's
     unfortunately not connected to love-hounds, but may soon be.
     1-604-572-4733.

1.3. How are they connected?

     To ensure that every message from the newsgroup rec.music.gaffa also
     finds its way into the mailing list love-hounds, rec.music.gaffa is
     a moderated newsgroup. This means that to post an article to r.m.g
     you have to send it as an email message to the moderator who has to
     approve the article. In r.m.g's case the 'moderator' is the receiving
     address for the list, i.e. love-hounds@uunet.uu.net. More intelligent
     news software does know about this and if you post an article instead
     of sending it to the moderator's address these systems act in one
     of three ways:

     1. Your article is thrown away. This is the reason why a lot of new
        readers don't find their articles in the news system. If you
        experience this, you have to use the love-hounds@uunet.uu.net
        address by yourself.
     2. Your article is re-packaged and forwarded to the moderator. While
        doing this, the news software insists on creating a new header.
        This is responsible for most of the postings with some news system
        as the sender and without any subject. It may be the case that your
        article actually is shown correctly on your news system, especially
        if the system forwarding it to the moderator isn't yours. In this
        case you might wonder why replies or follow-ups to your articles
        don't have any subject. If you experience this, you should either
        bug your system administrator (to change the behaviour to the third
        one below) or use the email address.
     3. Your article is directly forwarded to the moderator. This is perfectly
        ok, since then your name and subject lines survive.

     Be assured again that no article you write is thrown away due to its
     contents or your person. It's just the wrong way of posting it, since
     the whole process is fully automated.

1.4. Pictures? Soundfiles?

     Pictures of Kate can be found via ftp (see section 6) in the archives.
     And this is the place where they belong - they do not belong onto
     the list itself - especially since it is also distributed via email.

     If you want to submit a picture, put it onto some ftp site and announce
     this on gaffa. Thanks! If you don't have ftp write access ask for someone
     who does and send the picture to this single person.

     This is not because we don't want to have pictures - the opposite is
     true! But put them where they belong.

     The same is true for soundfiles, though they are from limited interest -
     basically only until the real thing is on the market. Before you ask -
     there is no common way to compress soundfiles. Using the best all-purpose
     techniques results at best in a 10% save, using specialised techniques
     results in a file that's not usable on all systems and in addition the
     sound quality decreases a bit.



2.   Important topics outside of rec.music.gaffa/Love-Hounds

2.1. Who is Happy Rhodes?

     Love-Hounds was founded with the idea of being a newsgroup about
     "Progressive Artists with emphasis on Kate Bush", so discussions
     about other "progressive artists" are generally encouraged. However,
     occasionly the talk about a different artist grows to a point where
     it is appropiate to form a seperate group. This is what happened
     with Happy Rhodes (this is really her name), whose song "Feed The Fire"
     (from Warpaint) was the most requested song on WXPN, a Philadelphia
     radio station. Happy Rhodes discussion now takes place on an evergrowing
     mailing list called Ecto. If you want to subscribe to this list, whose
     broad range of discussion now includes many other female artists
     (including Kate Bush), send a request to Jessica via:

        ecto-request@ns1.rutgers.edu

     To post a message send it to

        ecto@ns1.rutgers.edu.

     A comprehensive FAQ about Ecto can be found via ftp (see section 6
     for details on ftp) on hardees.rutgers.edu in the directory /pub/hr.
     The Ecto archives, a lot of pictures, interviews etc. can also be
     found there.

     How to get Happy's CDs:

     Happy will sign the albums when requested. Please note that Happy
     prefers it if you buy the albums in a normal shop. You can send her
     the booklets (with return postage) and she will happily sign and return
     them.

2.2. Who is Tori Amos?

     Another spin-off is the Tori Amos mailing list: Really-Deep-Thoughts.
     The address to subscribe to the mailing list is:

        rdt-request@gradient.cis.upenn.edu.

     The address to post to the mailing list is:

        rdt@gradient.cis.upenn.edu.

     The purpose of the list is to discuss and disseminate information about
     Tori Amos and her music, and anything else that seems relevant. Just
     a bit of info about Tori: There's a new album, "Under The Pink", that will
     appear 1st of February '94. A single ("God" in the US, "Cornflake Girl"
     in the UK) will appear about Jan 10. Again there will be a more or less
     worldwide Tori-and-her-piano tour.

        post:      blue-eyed-pop@morgan.ucs.mun.ca

     [are there other mailing lists that should appear here?]

2.4. Kate-talk, our very own version of IRC

     "Kate-talk" is a process that allows fans to talk to each other in real
     time. For more info contact Jessica at jessica@cs.rutgers.edu, who
     provides the following information: "You need a unix machine or a vms
     machine, connected directly to the internet. It compiles fairly easily
     on most unix machines. If you have trouble with yours, I'm willing to
     help get it running. Client programs can be ftped from hardees.rutgers.edu
     in /pub/icb-client.tar.Z for the unix client and in the pub/icb directory
     for the vms client. I know nothing about vms, and do not have a vms
     account, so I can't help much for vms people, and I don't have a clue what
     to do with the files that are there. I'd appreciate someone on a vms
     system trying it out for me :)"



3.   Love-Hounds and their netiquette

3.1. Famous Love-Hounds

     A less frequent visitor these days is Andy Marvick, or rather his
     self-parody "IED". IED is the absolute "true believer" KaTefan.
     IED, who will flame anyone showing any sign of diSbelIef, nowadaYs
     fulfilLs his roLe As encyclopedic demigod which seEms moRE natural for
     Him anyway.

     Come back Soon, IED!

     BTW: Andy doesn't know either what IED stands for. Make some suggestions!
     I prefer "I Envy Del"...

3.2. Flame-wars &amp; abbreviations

     Normally Katefans are nice people. Hey! We all share at least one similar
     taste in music! Nevertheless r.m.g shares something with every other
     usenet newsgroup - that is, there are flamewars. Even of the nasty
     kind. Noone likes them, so the best way to deal with rude and/or
     uninteresting posts is to ignore then and post something positive and
     interesting.

     Newbies are explicitly invited to take part in the conversation. Be it
     that you want to know something not in this FAQ, be it that you think
     you have a piece of information to share, be it that you think you
     know some other music you think should be known by more people. (Though
     I'd say you should at least like Kate :-) ...)

     Abbreviations commonly used on Love-Hounds include sideways faces, such
     as :-), IMHO (In My Humble Opinion), ROFL (Rolling on the floor
     laughing) and the initials of Kate's songs, such as RUTH for Running Up
     That Hill (sometimes known as DwG for Deal with God ;^).

3.3. What is Katemas?

     On or around July 30 each year there are a lot of parties around the
     world, when Love-Hounds celebrate Kate's birthday, also called Katemas.

     In 1991 there were parties in Boston, Washington DC, Cleveland, San Jose,
     Seattle, Austin, Dallas, Iowa City, Chapel Hill, Chicago, Ipswich UK,
     Sweden, and two places in Australia.

     In 1992 there were parties in Boston, San Fransisco, Chicago, Australia,
     Israel, and San Diego.

     In 1993 there were parties in San Jose, Linkvping (Sweden), Columbus,
     Oxford Mississippi, New Jersey, San Diego, Seattle, Chicago
     (belated&amp;shared), Wollongong (Australia), Wellington (New Zealand),
     Toronto.

     Anyone anywhere else?



4.   Kate Bush Info

4.1. Kate Bush - her carreer and Kate as a human being

     Kate's first appearance in the public was a little tour through a few
     London pubs together with the so called KT (read: Katie) Bush Band.
     All of Kate's albums have the KT (originally Knights Templar) symbol
     hidden somewhere either on the cover or on the vinyl itself (see section
     4.6). You might have to have original UK versions of the albums to find
     them. The KT initials can also be seen in the "Army Dreamers" video.
     The release of the This Woman's Work boxed set there appeared a new
     version of the KT symbol that includes            _O_
     the biological symbol for woman:                   |&lt;

     Fans of Kate were saddened by the news of the passing of her mother on
     Valentine's day, 1992.

     FAQs and most common answers:

     She's born on July 30, 1958. She's not married, but you should bury all
     hopes since her bassist and engineer, Del Palmer, is her one and only
     for too many years now. Any current rumours stating a break up are
     unconfirmed and undenied, but Kate &amp; Del have just appeared together
     while Kate did a signing session in New York. Kate smokes, but is very
     reluctant to show this bad habit in public. Kate, if you ever read this:
     count my vote as one who wants you to stop! Kate is a vegetarian, though
     she now eats fish. She's 5'3" (1.60m) and doesn't have a middle name. She
     has two brothers, John Carder Bush (Jay), born 1944 - he takes many of the
     photos of Kate that appear on her albums - and Paddy Bush, born 1952, who
     plays many of the exotic instruments found on Kate's albums. Yes, she is
     indeed a fox.

     No, she doesn't hate to tour, just can't find the time between making
     albums and videos. Yes, she appeared on Saturday Night Live in 1978, but
     the tape you can purchase of that show has her edited out! Yes, that's
     Donald Sutherland in the Cloudbusting video. No, we don't have her home
     address!

4.2. Basic Discography/Videography

     Kate's new Album, The Red Shoes, is out now. Unfortunately there are no
     plans to tour :-(, but what did you expect? Guest stars on the album
     include Eric Clapton, Prince, Jeff Beck, Colin Lloyd-Tucker, The Trio
     Bulgarka and Nigel Kennedy. The Red Shoes singles include Rubberband
     Girl (first UK&amp;elsewhere single, second US single), Eat The Music
     (first US single), Moments Of Pleasure (second UK&amp;elsewhere single).
     The next will be either Why Should I Love You or And So Is Love. Right
     now four videos have appeared. Two versions for Rubberband Girl, a video
     for Eat The Music, and one for Moments Of Pleasure. The 50 minutes film
     The Line, The Cross, And The Curve, has been premiered on November 13 in
     London, it features 6 songs from the album. We hope it will be published
     on video soon.

     Moments Of Pleasure is the first Kate Bush single that is NOT availlable
     on 7" vinyl (but there is a poster bag 12"). Guess this again marks the
     end of an era.

     The following is not intended to be a complete discography. Something that
     qualifies better for that title will be availlable separately soon.

     Albums and other major collections:

     The Cathy Demos (23 early songs, ca. 1975-77???, a MUST for every fan)
        Five of these are demos of songs that later appeared on albums.
        They are available on various bootlegs. (Anybody have an early 80's
        album called THE EARLY YEARS?) There are also six "Kick Inside demos",
        which include an unreleased song "Scares Me Silly". Also there are two
        Babooshka demos and various other songs on boots.
        Tracks (compiled from various boots - none contains all. The names are
        not officially known, so there are some songs with more than one name):
        The Kick Inside, Hammer Horror, A Rose Growing Old, Keep Me Waiting,
        Davy, Disbelieving Angel, Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake, Kite,
        L'Amour Looks Something Like You, Strange Phenomena, Scares Me Silly
        (Really Gets Me Going), Moving, Babooshka (2 versions), Kashka From
        Bagdad, Coming Up, Oh To Be In Love, Playing Canasta, Snow, Ferry Me

        Love, Queen Eddie, In My Garden, Frightened Eyes, Never The Less,
        Goodnight Baby, So Soft, I Don't See Why I Shouldn't
     The Kick Inside (TKI, February 17, 1978):
        The 'official' young Kate, full of passion, including her up to date
        only British number one megahit Wuthering Heights.
        Tracks: Moving, The Saxophone Song, Strange Phenomena, Kite, The Man
        With The Child In His Eyes, Wuthering Heights, James And The Cold Gun,
        Feel It, Oh To Be In Love, L'Amour Looks Something Like You, Them Heavy
        People, Room For The Life
     Lionheart (LH, November 13, 1978):
        Quick followup to TKI, but still true Kate, i.e. great stuff.
        This album now is available in a special $80 "Lioness At Heart"
        edition, which includes a t-shirt, an album sized photo book, a poster
        and a postcard. It's out of print now, and you might have to search
        a bit.
        Tracks: Symphony In Blue, In Search Of Peter Pan, Wow, Don't Push Your
        Foot On The Heartbrake, Oh England My Lionheart, Fullhouse, In The Warm
        Room, Kashka From Baghdad, Coffee Homeground, Hammer Horror
     Never For Ever (NfE, September 8, 1980):
        Shows the beginning of Kate's carreer as a producer and a general
        change of style away from the girlish high pitched voice from the first
        two albums.
        This album is also available in a special edition similar to the
        "A Lioness At Heart" box. Also out of print it additionally includes a
        numbered certificate.
        Tracks: Babooshka, Delius (Song Of Summer), Blow Away (For Bill), All
        We Ever Look For, Egypt, The Wedding List, Violin, The Infant Kiss,
        Night Scented Stock, Army Dreamers, Breathing
     The Dreaming (TD, September 13, 1982):
        Many say this is Kate's best work to date, though it was not as
        successful commercially. Difficult to get into, but if you finally
        reach it, then: play it... LOUDER!
        Sat In Your Lap, There Goes A Tenner, Pull Out The Pin, Suspended In
        Gaffa, Leave It Open, The Dreaming, Night Of The Swallow, All The Love,
        Houdini, Get Out Of My House
     The Singles File (1984, January 23):
        Box of all UK 7" vinyl singles up to 1984, very collectible.
        It contains a booklet and the following singles: Wuthering
        Heights/Kite, The Man With The Child In His Eyes/Moving, Hammer
        Horror/Coffee Homeground, Wow/Fullhouse, On Stage (Them Heavy
        People/Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake/James And The Cold
        Gun/L'Amour Looks Something Like You, all live), Breathing/The Empty
        Bullring, Babooshka/Ran Tan Waltz, Army Dreamers/Delius/Passing Through
        Air, December Will Be Magic Again/Warm And Soothing, Sat In Your
        Lap/Lord Of The Reedy River, The Dreaming/Dreamtime, There Goes A
        Tenner/Ne T'Enfuis Pas, Ne T'Enfuis Pas/Un Baiser D'Enfant
     Hounds of Love (HoL, September 16, 1985):
        Two sided album, even on CD. One side light, one side dark. The dark
        side once was supposed to be filmed, but the movie got lost in all
        the promotion that came around HoL and TWS. Side two, also called
        The Ninth Wave, is about a woman drowning alone at night in the sea.
        All her dreams, emotions, thoughts, memories pass by in the songs.
        Is she rescued? Kate says so, your mileage may vary.
        Tracks: (HOL:) Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God), Hounds Of Love,
        The Big Sky, Mother Stands For Comfort, Cloudbusting, (TNW:) And Dream
        Of Sheep, Under Ice, Waking The Witch, Watching You Without Me, Jig Of
        Life, Hello Earth, The Morning Fog
     The Whole Story (TWS, November 10, 1986)
        A compilation of Kate's biggest hits to date, also availlable on video.
        Tracks: Wuthering Heights (new vocal), Cloudbusting, The Man With The
        Child In His Eyes, Breathing, Wow, Hounds Of Love, Running Up That
        Hill, Army Dreamers, Sat In Your Lap, Experiment IV, The Dreaming,
        Babooshka. Additional on video: The Big Sky. Additional on new edition
        of (PAL) LaserDisc: The Sensual World, This Woman's Work, Love And 
        Anger
     The Sensual World (TSW, October 19?, 1989):
        According to Kate this is her "most feminine" album. Any idea as what
        this means? Many complain about noisy engineering, which seems to vary
        at least a bit with the country of origin of the CD. Some love it, some
        don't quite love it, especially "Reaching Out".
        Tracks: The Sensual World, Love And Anger, The Fog, Reaching Out, Heads
        We're Dancing, Deeper Understanding, Between A Man And A Woman, Never
        Be Mine, Rocket's Tail, This Woman's Work, Walk Straight Down The
        Middle (last track not on LP version)
     This Woman's Work Boxed Set (TWW, 1990).
        Not released in the USA, only in UK, Japan, Canada and France. Awfully
        pricey, and no lyrics or credits on the extra disks except for the
        Japanese version. The box includes all 6 regular albums (no TWS of
        course) as well as two special extra discs that normally aren't
        availlable separately. These two discs contain almost all B-sides,
        dance-mixes and other incidentals. Some are unfortunately missing,
        major ones are: Dreamtime (The Dreaming instrumental/remix), Running Up
        That Hill (instrumental), Breathing (live, from "The Utterly Utterly
        Live Comic Relief)", The Sensual World (instrumental), Be Kind to
        My Mistakes (original soundtrack album version, much longer than and
        very different from the single re-mix, most like it better), The
        Confrontation (instrumental from the Comic Strip film GLC). It doesn't
        contain any previously unreleased material or session work with other
        artists. Great music though, yeah! And the first time most of these
        songs are availlable on CD.

        The French version is a re-shrink-wrapped UK version. The Canadian
        version, currently easily available and relatively cheap, does contain
        the Canadian CDs which do have thinner booklets for some of the regular
        albums that do not always contain the lyrics. The Japanese version has:

            - none of the 4-12 stickers with the new KTfem symbol:  _O_
              Any idea of what to do with them?                      |&lt;
            - more and bigger booklets in Japanese, including lyrics in English
              and Japanese, especially also for the two special CDs.
            - the Japanese cover art for TKI and NfE, as well as
            - Japanese CDs which have the usual benefit of somehow "sounding
              better". This IS true (come here and I'll show you), but mainly
              comes from better pressing, not from different data. Better
              pressing means less drop outs and less need of error correction.
              If you've got a good player this doesn't matter at all.

        Tracks: (CD1:) The Empty Bullring, Ran Tan Waltz, Passing Through Air,
        December Will Be Magic Again, Warm And Soothing, Lord Of The Reedy
        River, Ne T'En Fui Pas, Un Baiser D'Enfant, Under The Ivy, Burning
        Bridge, My Lagan Love, The Handsome Cabin Boy, Not This Time, Walk
        Straight Down The Middle, Be Kind To My Mistakes, (CD2:) I'm Still
        Waiting, Ken, One Last Look Around The House Before We Go..., Wuthering
        Heights (New Vocal), Experiment IV, Them Heavy People (live), Don't
        Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake (live), James And The Cold Gun (live),
        L'Amour Looks Something Like You (live), Running Up That Hill (Maxi),
        Cloudbusting (The Organon Mix), Hounds Of Love (Alternative), The Big
        Sky (Meteorological Mix), Experiment IV (12" Mix)

     The Red Shoes (TRS, November 1, 1993):
        Her "most accessible" album. At first it sounds untypical for Kate,
        but this has been valid for every new album so far. There will be
        several special editions of this album, one official from UK, one
        official from the USA, and several inofficial repackagings.
        Tracks: Rubberband Girl, And So is Love, Eat the Music, Moments of
        Pleasure, The Song of Solomon, Lily, The Red Shoes, Top of the City,
        Constellation of the Heart, Big Stripey Lie, Why Should I Love You?,
        You're the One

     Official video tapes/laserdiscs:

     Live At The Hammersmith Odeon (1981):
        TV special of Kate's only concert tour, unfortunately it contains only
        one hour out of the two and a half hour show.
        Tracks: Moving, Them Heavy People, Violin, Strange Phenomena, Hammer
        Horror, Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake, Wow, Feel It, Kite,
        James And The Cold Gun, Oh England My Lionheart, Wuthering Heights
     The Single File (December 1983):
        Contains all of Kate's video up till 1983. Similar to The Whole Story,
        but contains five videos not on The Whole Story and it lacks the newer
        videos. Not availlable in the USA, but it's available on import from
        Canada.
        Tracks: Wuthering Heights, The Man With The Child In His Eyes, Hammer
        Horror, Wow (earlier version), Them Heavy People, Breathing, Babooshka,
        Army Dreamers, Sat In Your Lap, The Dreaming, Suspended In Gaffa, There
        Goes A Tenner
     Hair Of The Hound (June 16, 1986):
        This tape is now out of date since all four videos from the Hounds of
        Love album are also on The Whole Story.
        Tracks: Running Up That Hill, Hounds Of Love, The Big Sky, Cloudbusting
     The Whole Story (1986):
        Contains most of Kate's videos up to 1986: All songs from the
        corresponding album plus the video for The Big Sky. The video to
        Experiment IV is only availlable here, so TSF + HOTH isn't sufficient.
        A new PAL LaserDisc now also contains the three videos from The Sensual
        World.
        Tracks: see albums above.
     The Sensual World (1989):
        Contains three videos from that album and interview footage with
        excerpts from a lot of other videos. The American version contains much
        less interview footage than the British version. The British version is
        the complete 1989 VH-1 special.
        Tracks: Interview, The Sensual World, This Woman's Work, Love And Anger

     Soon to come (hopefully): The Line, The Cross, and The Curve - the new
     50 minutes film around 6 songs from the new album The Red Shoes.

        Tracks: ? (I don't have this tape)

     There are also far more than a hundred "underground" videos, which
     are traded among fans and are shown at Katemas parties and the like.
     These are primarily television performances and interviews.

     Kate has worked with a lot of other artists:

     - Roy Harper:
       - You (The Game Part II). From "The Unknown Soldier"
       - Once. From "Once"

       - Don't Give Up. From "So"
       - Keine Selbstkontrolle,
       - Spiel ohne Grenzen. Both from the German version of "III", Kate's
         backing vocals are the same as in the English version.
       There are remixes of Games Without Frontiers. Don't Give Up exists in
       various lengths, the biggest differences are in the intro and extro.
     - Leslie Duncan:
       - Sing, Children Sing.
     - Zaine Griff
       - Flowers. From "Figures"

     Of course one shouldn't forget the Utah Saints single "Something Good"
     which samples the line "Oh I just know that something good is going
     to happen" from Cloudbusting. Also in the video to "Something Good"
     about 30 seconds of the Cloudbusting video are used. Kate does like
     the Utah Saints and everything is approved by her.

4.3. Printed books

     Printed books on Kate are numerous, more details about and corrections
     to these books are available in the archives:

     Kate Bush - A Visual Documentary (1988):
        Probably the best liked book overall.
     Kate Bush Complete (1987):
        "Official" book containing the sheet music to all of Kate's songs up to
        1986. Also contains separate lyrics, a great chronology, many photos,
        and a discography.
     Cathy (1986):
        Book of photos of Kate as a child, by her brother, John Carter Bush.
        No longer available. :-(
     The Illustrated Collector's Guide To Kate Bush (1991):
        Book with details and pictures of all kinds of Kate Kollectables, fun
        even for non-collectors. To order send $13.95 to C-SIDE RECORDS,
        PO BOX 8456 CLEARWATER, FL 34618. Phone 1-813-461-4327. C-SIDE is
        also a good place to get all kinds of Kate stuff, be sure to get on
        their mailing list.
     Kate Bush - The Whole Story (1988):
        Despite appearances, not a sanctioned book, and certainly not the whole
        story. Positive, but contains numerous factual and publishing errors.
        For "The Whole Story" on this book, see Andrew Marvick's review in the
        archives.
     Kate Bush - The First Twelve Years (1992):
        Homeground says: is another collection of newpaper and magazine cutting
        covering the years from 1978 in two volumes selling for about L12-00 in
        Britain and L15 postpaid to America.  Details can be obtained via the
        fanzine Never For Ever. [See below]
     Kate Bush - With Love (1988):
        Reprints of Kate-related articles, interviews, and reviews, some
        positive, some negative. Interesting mainly to see how the music press
        has reacted to Kate over the years.
     Secret History of Kate Bush (And The Strange Art Of Pop) (1983):
        Intellectual (as opposed to intelligent) book abut Kate's family
        history, story, and fans. Commonly available, but only recommend for
        the photos.
     Kate Bush: Princess of Suburbia by Fred and Judy Vermorel (1980?):
        Not so good. Hard to find.
     Kate Bush: An Illustrated Biography (1980) by Paul Kerton:
        Positive but error-prone book. Hard to find. Was also available in
        German.

4.4. Fanzines

     After being on love-hounds for a few months, most fans find the
     fanzines rarely have information they have not already heard. The most
     common fanzines are the Kate Bush Club (KBC) and Homeground. More
     about these and other fanzines can be found in "The Garden". See section
     4.5 for details.

     Kate Bush Club (KBC):
        The KBC unfortunately only seems to come now when there is a new
        album out, but is always worth the wait as it has original articles
        by Kate and her family and lots of great photos.

        KBC
        PO Box 120
        Welling, Kent, DA16 3DS
        UK

        There now is a new edition of the fanzine for The Red Shoes, send
        an SASE (self addressed and stamped envelope) or a SAE &amp; IRC (self
        addressed envelope &amp; international reply coupon) to the KBC for
        information, or 6 pounds sterling (Europe rate, cash or British
        currency ckeck, Euro check in Pounds is ok) or US$14 (US dollar
        cheques or US currency) to get a copy of the magazine which includes
        about 20 color photos. Right now any SA[S]E should be marked "SAE 3",
        except if you already have sent an "SAE 3" to the KBC.

     Homeground
        Homeground comes out almost regularly and has news, great
        articles, stories, and drawings.

        Homeground
        PO Box 176
        Orpington, Kent, BR5 3NA
        UK

     Never For Ever
        Never For Ever is another long-establish fanzine. It has been dormant
        for the last year or so. Anyone heard anything from them?

        28 Millbrook Street
        Plasmarl
        Swansea 
        SA6 8JY
        UK

4.5. Electronic books

     A while ago two collections have been made availlable, both of which are
     much more interesting then anything published. They can be ftped from
     ftp.uu.net, as usual. See section 6 for details. There are also disk
     versions of these floating around somewhere (a set in MS-DOS format, and
     a set in Macintosh format). Only requirement to get them is a) to find
     them and b) to agree to send them to the next one requesting them.

     "The Garden"
        The Garden is Andrew Marvick's compilation of reference material on
        Kate, [availible in .../kb/garden] including a detailed chronology of
        her life and career (much more complete then anything available
        anywhere else) [GARDEN01]. Also, a listing of all known Kate
        recordings, videography (which includes both official videos and the
        television appearances), and an extensive list of fan magazines
        [GARDEN02]. ALL of the lyrics (including background voices) to ALL of
        Kate's known songs (including unreleased songs) [GARDEN04]. All of
        John's and Paddy's [GARDEN03] interviews and articles for the Kate Bush
        Club Newsletter, as well as Kate's articles for the KBC [GARDEN05,
        GARDEN06]. Also included are about sixty interviews [GARDEN07 through
        GARDEN10].

     "Cloudbusting - Kate Bush In Her Own Words"
        This is Ron Hill (the [ex-]keeper of this monthly post)'s compilation
        of almost 200 interviews, sorted by song, story, and subject order,
        forming the closest we may ever see to a full-fledged Kate
        autobiography. It is available in regular text format, or in
        Wordperfect 4.2 format, which makes use of Wordperfect's underlining,
        bolding, and italizing, ability, and contains an extensive index. It
        is also available in MacWrite II, PostScript, and Word 4.0 versions.
        (Eventually the extra unedited interviews will be added into The
        Garden).

        There are also a series of Cloudbusting GIF (picture) files, which are
        located in .../kb/cloudbusting/gif [APPARENTLY THESE ARE TRASHED]. A
        title page [CTITLE.GIF and a larger version, CTITLEB.GIF], a title page
        for Part II [CSTORY.GIF] and part III [CSUBJECT.GIF], a credits screen
        [CREDITS.GIF], and a pic of 3 inch disk label [CLABEL.GIF, and a b&amp;w
        version CLABELBW.GIF]. There are also pictures for most of the albums
        which show the picture of Kate from the album cover next to a listing
        of songs [titles begin with "O"]. There are also "alternative" pics for
        some of the albums, which  show pictures SIMILAR to but not identical
        to the album covers [files begin with "A"]. There are also "full"
        pictures for some of the albums [titles begin with "F"], which are the
        raw, uncropped, pictures.

        Cloudbusting is available in .../kb/cloudbusting. The text version is
        in .../kb/cloudbusting/text. Filenames are cloud0.txt, cloud1a.txt,
        cloud1b.txt, cloud1c.txt, cloud2a.txt, cloud2b.txt, cloud3a.txt, cloud
        3b.txt, cloud3c.txt, cloud4.txt, cloud5.txt, clouds.txt. It is also
        available compressed with ZIP in .../kb/cloudbusting/zip as filenames
        cloud045.zip, cloud1.zip, cloud2.zip, cloud3.zip.

     "Deeper Understanding - A collection of Kate Bush articles"
        This third, in-progress book, also by Ron Hill, will compile the "best
        of" the Love-Hounds as well as a few articles from fan magazines and
        lots of published reviews. It'll be about five megs in size.

4.6. Where are those d*mn KT symbols on all the albums?

     I don't want to spoil these answers, so they are encoded with a rot13
     scheme. If you do not have means to decode this, here's a description
     of how to do it by hand:

     Rot13 encoding assings a new letter to each letter that is in the
     alphabet. Every letter is replaced by the letter 13 positions further
     into the alphabet. Add another alphabet (...xyzabc...) to the end to
     get enough letters. Alternatively you can also subtract 13 positions.
     Coding and encoding are the same this way. Here's a table:

     abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
     nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm

     This says that every 'a' has to replaced by an 'n', every 'b' by an 'o'
     and so on. Now here are the solutions:

5.   Questions about Kate's music

     This area is divided into the different albums as well as a section
     for the home demo recordings and for miscellaneous tracks.

     The lyrics for all of the songs can be found on both gaffa relevant
     ftp sites: ftp.uu.net and ftp.uwp.edu. They are too long to be cited here.
     The file ftp.uu.net:/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/lyrics/most-lyrics.ied
     contains all lyrics up to The Sensual World and its singles, including
     all non-official songs and all non-official parts of the lyrics (backing
     vocals, spoken passages etc.)

     Right now there are areas where I haven't found the time to say
     something. Feel free to contribute!

     More information about most of the songs can be found in the archives,
     so sometimes I will only give a pointer to a long story if it is too
     long to be cited here in full.

5.1. Home Demo Recordings

     Kate has never commented on any bootleg material, and so she hasn't
     said anything about these as bootlegs. But she has said plenty of
     things about these recordings - generally to the effect that there
     are about 200 or more of them (20-30 have been 'released' on boots)
     and that they should remain buried. Nevertheless most fans do LOVE
     these songs and would almost kill to hear the rest.

5.2. The Kick Inside

     Wuthering Heights
        Kate's first hit and (until now) only British number one single
        is based on Emily Bronte's novel of the same name, though Kate
        first saw the old film of it and later read the book.

5.3. Lionheart

     Coffee Homeground
        This song features two lines (one repeated again) in German, but
        it's not as prominent as in Hello Earth. The lines read "Es schmeckt
        wunderbar" (it tastes wonderful) and "Noch ein Glass mein
        Liebchen/Liebling" (another glass, my darling).

5.4. Never for Ever

5.5. The Dreaming

5.6. Hounds of Love

     Cloudbusting:
        This is based on Peter Reich's book "A Book Of Dreams" (you can see
        this book in the video, in Donald Sutherland's pocket). Peter writes
        about his experience in his youth, when Wilhelm Reich (his father)
        got problems with the government due to his questionable actions as a
        scientist. Wilhelm got arrested and died while in prison, and this
        experience later made the then-9-years-old Peter write "A Book Of
        Dreams". He was arrested for refusing to appear at an arrangement
        hearing that resulted from a lawsuit by the American FDA for selling
        his "orgone energy accumulators" across state lines. The FDA said it
        was quackery to sell these boxes made of aluminium and wood as
        therapeutic devices; Reich insisted it was serious science and refused
        to have anything to do with these "spurious" legal restrictions on his
        research and therapy. Of course, he was quite mad by then - this was
        nearly a decate after he claimed that orgone energy was not simply the
        libidinal buildup that resulted from a lack of proper sexual release,
        but was also the substance out of which the whole universe was formed.
        Interestingly, several well-known people, including Norman Mailer,
        had orgone accumulators. More about Wilhelm Reich can be found in the
        file ftp.uu.net:/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/reich.
        [part of this description was written by James Alexander Chokey
        &lt;jchokey@leland.Stanford.EDU&gt;.]

     Hello Earth:
        At the end of "Hello, Earth" the German words are: "Tiefer, tiefer,
        irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht" This means: "deeper, deeper,
        somewhere in the depth there is a light." They are not spoken by
        Kate, but by Gabi Zangerl, a friend of Kate.

5.7. The Sensual World

     The Sensual World
        This song at first should have included the original lyrics of the
        end monologe of Molly Bloom in James Joyce's "Ulysses", but Kate
        didn't get permission, so she had to rewrite them.

     Ken
     The Confrontation
     One Last Look Around The House Before We Go
        These three peaces appeared in the soundtrack to the half hour
        British TV programme "The Comic Strip Presents... G.L.C". G.L.C.
        stands for Greater London Council, Ken was played by Robbie Coltrane,
        playing Charles Bronson, as 'Red' Ken Livingstone, who was - as the
        song 'Ken' reminds us - the leader of the G.L.C. 'Red', that is, as
        referring to his hard-left policies. Ken was fighting against the
        'Iron Lady' Margaret Thatcher.
        [part of this information is from thecrow@eskimo.com (The Crow)]

5.8. The Red Shoes

5.9. Miscellaneous

     December Will Be Magic Again
        This is originally a single on its own, but has now been used in almost
        too many singles as a b-side (Experiment IV, Moments Of Pleasure (UK),
        Rubberband Girl (US)), and is quite often used on Christmas samplers
        by EMI. One of these featured an alternate ('bongo') version of the
        song.

     Experiment IV
        This is the 'teaser' for the semifans on the sampler The Whole Story.

     Rocket Man
     Candle In The Wind
        The Elton John cover version Rocket Man appeared on the Elton John
        and Bernie Taupin tribute album Two Rooms featuring a whole bunch
        of cover versions. Rocket Man also is availlable as a single where
        it is backed with another EJ cover, Candle In The Wind, which is
        availlable in a normal and an instrumental version.

     Brazil
        This cover of the 30s song was originally supposed to be included
        in the film of the same name. Unfortunately it was left out. But
        we were lucky, since the soundtrack for Brazil (which only appeared
        in 1992) includes the song.




6.   The Archives

     The love-hounds archive resides on ftp.uu.net [137.39.1.9], in the
     directory /usenet/rec.music.gaffa - if you don't know how to do ftp
     (or what ftp is), then see section 6.3. All pathnames with '...' at
     the beginning should have '/usenet/rec.music.gaffa' before them.

     There's also an incoming directory.

     Most of these files can also be found on Dave Datta's music archive
     residing on ftp.uwp.edu, though they are in different directories there.

6.1. Previous messages from love-hounds

     All previous messages from love-hounds can be ftped from the archives,
     residing in yearly directories under .../archives. Often the archives
     are a bit behind reality, but at the moment we are almost up to date.
     Thanks Bill!

6.2. Other files

     All other files are in .../kb. These include:

     - The two electronic books mentioned above
     - lyrics to ALL songs
     - interviews
     - reviews
     - pictures, mostly GIF, all under .../kb/pix:
       - from the 1990 Kate Bush Convention, including pics of Kate's house
         and a Love-Hounds group pic (lovename.pic)
       - from the Cathy book (cathy??.gif)
       - from the This Woman's Work booklet (TWW??.gif)
       - from the Tour of Live booklet (page_??.gif)
       - from all albums [anyone with The Red Shoes?]
       - and uncounted more

       To view these GIFs you will need a program for your type of computer.
       Public domain picture file viewers include CSHOW and PICEM for the IBM,
       TURBOGIF and HAMGIF for the Amiga, Giffer or QuickGif for the
       Macintosh, and ImageViewer for the NeXT.

6.3. How to do ftp?

     To use ftp directly you have to have direct access to the internet.

     You connect by typing

        ftp ftp.UU.NET              [or: ftp 137.39.1.9]

     Log in as "anonymous" or "ftp" and use your username as your password.
     To change directories e.g. type

        cd /usenet/rec.music.gaffa

     Other commands are:

        dir &lt;dirname&gt;       [get a directory, &lt;dirname&gt; is optional, current
                             if omitted]
        get &lt;filename&gt;      [get the requested file]
        bin                 [set transfer to binary mode, this is needed
                             for pictures and compressed files. Best is
                             if you always do 'bin' first, so you don't forget]
        bye                 [end the ftp session]

     If you don't have FTP (file transfer ability) you can still get the files
     by using an FTP mail server run by DEC. You send it a list of commands
     and then it sends you the files as regular mail messages, so anyone who
     has the ability to send and receive private mail can use this. If a file
     is larger then 60k it will be send as more than one message.

     If you want to GET binary files (GIF picture files, Wordperfect files, or
     anything that's not straight text) it will send you the files in a
     special text format called UUENCODED, you will need a program called
     UUDECODE for your computer to decode these. Note that this is not always
     the most relible way of getting files, ie you may have to do it several
     times.

     To start off using this, send a message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com, the
     first message should read simply HELP - don't bother with a subject line
     as these are ignored. You will be sent back the basic commands and some
     examples, read this carefully (as much as you are able to understand).
     Here are some specific examples for accessing the love-hounds archives,
     don't type the parts in brackets []. Note that when typing in file names,
     upper and lower case are important! Parts in &lt;&gt; have to replaced by
     something useful.

     [There is another similar service that can be reached at
     bitftp@pucc.Princeton.edu - send a message with body HELP (subject
     isn't important), and you will receive instructions. This site seems
     to be faster than ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com]

        connect ftp.UU.NET              [connect to the file archives]
        chdir usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb [change to the main area, only one

        get cloud1b.txt                 [GET another file, only 10 at once]
        get cloud1c.txt
        quit

        get GARDEN01                    [GET first GARDEN file]
        get GARDEN02                    [GET another file, only 10 at once]
        quit

     -&gt; Connect to pix.hill and get love-hounds picture:

        reply &lt;your address&gt;
        connect ftp.UU.NET
        chdir usenet/rec.music.gaffa/kb/pix/pix.hill
        uuencode                        [specify UUENCODE format]
        binary                          [specify BINARY format]
        get LOVENAME.GIF
        quit

     If you can't FTP and you don't have the patience to figure all this out,
     the BBSes listed above offer the GIFs and many of the other files too.
