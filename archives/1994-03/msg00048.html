Hi,

yesterday I found a sturdily stiffened letter in my mailbox. Contents were
two thick cardboard sheets (one was the envelope) and actually two magazines.
Obviously the KBC was soooo glad receiving a 6 pounds Eurocheck from me
that they did send two copies to me. I'll swap the second copy for any old
KBC magazine in good to mint condition. Anyone interested?

Anyhow, the magazine consists of:

- 36 pages
- 22 of them with high quality color photos (ok, one drawing)
- 9 of the rest hold b/w photos
- additionally a folded 1994 calendar sheet insert with another color photo
- lots of interesting text:
  - p.1: title page with color photo of Kate holding a glass cover of a windlight 

      over it, above it a KT-fem symbol, below 'THE RED SHOES'
  - p.2,3,6: a letter from Kate describing song by song, ending with "Well, I'd
      better go and get on with "The Red Shoes II" ... it worked for Meatloaf!!"
      below the letter there's a pic of Kate (b/w)
  - p.4: color photo of Kate in her Eat-The-Music-dress
  - p.5: color photo of the upper half of Kate and a bird on her head
  - p.7: color photo of Kate in her ETM dress and a bunch of musicians
  - p.8,10,12,13: "Cloning Made Easy - recollections of The Red Shoes by Del 

      Palmer", several b/w photos on these pages
  - p.9: color photo of Kate &amp; Miranda Richardson, Miranda holding the Red 

      Shoes over Kate's shoulders from behind her
  - p.11: color photo of Miranda grinning evilly
  - p.14: color photo of Kate 'looking for help'
  - p.15: color photo of Kate's head lying in Lily's lap, film equipment in
      background
  - p.16: color drawing of Kate holding a red rose and a pair of Red Shoes
  - p.17: color photo of several musicians and a photo of Kate holding a bird
  - p.18: color photo of Kate with the bird on her head, Kate is wearing a
      black-red dress
  - p.19: color photo of Kate in black dress wearing Red Shoes sitting on a white
      box
  - p.20: color photo of Kate and Miranda dancing and color photo of film
      set with Kate reading in a sheet of paper lying on Lily's lap
  - p.21: color photo of Steward Arnold and a letter from Steward
  - p.22: color photo of Kate's head with a light green scarf with flowers 

      printed on it
  - p.23: color photo of Kate's upper half in black dress with heart&amp;flower 

      shaped diamond broche
  - p.24: b/w photo of Kate with bird on her head, wearing the same dress as on 

      page 18
  - p.25: lyrics for Home For Christmas, hand written by Kate (see separate post)
  - p.26: color photo of Kate and a candle
  - p.27: b/w photo of Kate sitting on box and wearing the ETM dress
  - p.28: color photo of Kate with mouth open like for singing, Kate wears a
      red blouse or dress and a brown cloak
  - p.29: b/w photo of Kate in black dress
  - p.30: color photo of Kate and a bunch of musicians (Paddy behind Kate)
      trampling over a bunch of fruits
  - p.31: letter from Paddy &amp; information about Paddy's own music
  - p.32: color photo of Kate's head with bird on it
  - p.33: color photo of Kate sitting on box with ETM dress, Kate smiles
  - p.34: b/w photo similar to page 9's photo
  - p.35: Notes about Alan Stivell's album 'Alan Stivell Again' where Kate
      produced the track 'The Kimiad'. Kate is also featured on keyboards and BVs
      There are no *immediate* plans to release TLTC&amp;TC on video, no back
      issues or merchandise availlable, picture credits, b/w photo of Kate with
      bird on head, wearing the red-black dress again
  - p.36 (back): color photo of Kate's head &amp; shoulders, not wearing anything
      (well, the photo stops early enough [or too early? ;-) ]) and address of
      the KBC
  - calendar front: color photo of Kate's head with light green &amp; flower scarf,
      similar to p.22, and a box for each month (6 above, 6 below pic)
  - calendar back: swaps &amp; pen pals, personal messages from the KBC, results
      of last competition (no new one)

Now you want to know how to get a copy? Well, email me if you have a surplus
copy of an old issue or mail to the KBC with 6 pounds or 14 US-$. Either cash
or checks in British currency (basically checks that can be made to British
currency without paying fees, that is Britain based checks or Eurochecks or
International Money Orders (those are _*expensive*_ for you!)). The address
to write to is:

KBC
PO Box 120
Welling
Kent DA16 3DS
England

Remember: if you also do send a SAE+IRC or a SASE marked 'SAE3' you will
get the next 'small newsletter' (that is a photocopied piece of paper
with the latest news).

Bye,

Uli
