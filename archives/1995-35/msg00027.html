Calling all Goths, sci-fi fans, fantasy afficiandos, RennFaire, Faerie

        Elbo Room, San Francisco, CA    415-552-7788

The Flash Girls are Emma Bull, the fantasy author, and The Fabulous
Lorraine, from Minneapolis.
Between them, they produce a blend of music that ranges from dark gothic horror 
to airy Irish dance tunes.  In 1994, they won the Minnesota Music Academy's 
"World Folk Group" award, and their music has been praised by reviewers on both 
sides of the Atlantic.  Folk Roots magazine called it "acoustic, bold and like 
all things a touch wicked, delicious."  Minnesota's City Pages said "the Flash 
Girls have created a wide-open space for all manner of quality material. 

Lyrists for The Flash Girls include comics author Neil Gaiman, Alan Moore,
Sci-fi fantasy author Jane Yolen, and of course, herself, Emma Bull.

"Audiences at Flash Girls shows soon discover that they've been
transported into 
a bizarre other world, full of haunting melodies and strange, unnerving 
sentiments and peopled by odd creatures, many of whom you wouldn't necessarily 
invite home to meet your parents -- such as the protagonists of "A Girl Needs A 
Knife" or "Tea and Corpses".  On the other hand, this fantastic landscape has 
the occasional pothole, such as the hapless explorer who finally finds his 
"Yeti".  Meandering through this odd country, stitching it all together, runs 
The Fabulous Lorraine's fiddle."
Their website is at :<A  HREF="http://www.player.org/pub/flash/flash.html">http://www.player.org/pub/flash/flash.html</A>

And Annwn? They are SF Bay's only "Celtic Jazz Fusion" band.  
Their second CD "Come Away To The Hills" is due out this month.  The
members are 
Leigh Ann Hussey, Elton Wildermuth, Billie Mandell and Greg Hines (Greg also 
plays with the group Your Mother Should Know).  They played at Jerry Garcia's 
wedding reception in 1994 and they have opened up for the David Grisham
Quintet. 
Their schedule brings them 
to St. Michaels Alley in Palo Alto on a fairly regular basis.  

 Annwn has a home 
page.  Hven't vivited it in awhile, but you can check it out if you wish.
