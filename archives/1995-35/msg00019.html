     Who would have thought Kate could kick up such a storm about these? 
     
     Vegemite(TM) is a yeast extract made by Kraft Foods. In New Zealand 
     (and Australia I think?) it is a cultural icon, along with pavlova - 
     the discovery of which our two countries still argue about. 
     Marmite(TM) is also a yeast extract and is made by the Sanitarium 
     Health Food Company (here at least). Marmite has a stronger flavour 
     than Vegemite, hence Vegemite is favoured for smearing thickly on 
     fresh bread and butter. Because of its stronger flavour, Marmite is 
     favoured as a stock (gravy flavouring). It is not a gravy substitute 
     as such, but because both Marmite and Vegemite have a 'meaty-ish' 
     taste you can put some into your gravy to give it a richer flavour. 
     Both products are popular with health freaks because they're 
     jam-packed with B-group vitamins (esp Niacin and Riboflavin). A yummy 
     way to eat Vegemite is to split a weetbix (weetabix in the UK), butter 
     it and put Vegemite on top. Of course the thought of smearing yeast 
     extract on bread may disgust some people. Then again I understand that 
     some cultures actually use peanut butter mixed with jelly ....blarg!  
     
     I doubt that anyone in their right mind would try to make gravy out of 
     marmalade unless they were looking for a sweet&amp;sour sauce substitute. 
     Marmalade is a type of jam (as opposed to 'jelly', which in NZ is a 
     clear (strained) product) 'Jam' still has the seeds and/or rind in 
     it). Traditional marmalade is slightly bitter and is made mostly from 
     lemons and oranges and their rinds which crystallise in the jam (like 
     the crystalized fruit people put in fruit cakes). Nowadays you can 
     also get lemon and orange only marmalades, of various sweetnesses, 
     ginger and lime marmalades too. For those who like bitter things for 
     breakfast (eg coffee and grapefruits) I recommend you try bitter 
     marmalade on toast.
     
     By the way, as John Lennon correctly pointed out the sky is also made 
     of marmalade;-).
     
     Who sang "toast and marmalade for tea, sailing ships upon the sea"? 
     Who remembers the 70's band 'The Marmalade'? What were their hits?
     
     Can't wait to get my Kateopia!

Hi gang -

    I'm sitting here listening to Heather Nova's "Oyster" which I just 
picked up today after reading about it here.  It doesn't sound a lot like 
Kate, but it is quite good.  Sort of like Sarah McLachlan with loud 
electric guitars.  Anybody know anything about Heather?  I had never heard
of her until seeing her mentioned here.

    It's definitely more guitar oriented than Kate or Sarah's stuff.  I like 
what I've heard so far.

What is the HOTFP?

The HOTFP is a project to build VRML or
3D worlds on the World Wide Web that
link together creations centered around the
person and work of Kate Bush.  Each world
should reflect something of her, and something
of its creator's vision of her, her work and more
importantly, of the creator of the world.

That is art at its best:  the self and the other.
To learn what we are by what we imagine.
To become more human by making of imagination
what we wish to be.  To join others in Making, 
and become more than we are.  Humans.

Why?

For our pleasure.  To teach others about Kate.
To explore our desires and in so doing,
kiss the cheek of the sleeping princess, which is
our imagination that when awakened, fires our
souls to grow about the center of the world.

How?

By learning from each other.  By doing.

Unlike the T-shirt project, there is no stop,
start or final product that determines success.
This makes it much easier to succeed.
Like homepages, you can build worlds alone
or in teams.  You choose.  When you are ready,
you can email this list, and the rest of us
can link to you.   This is known as "encapsulation".
It is vital to avoiding singularities, the black holes
of human effort that freeze you like an Argonaut
before the Gorgon:  too many snakes; not enough
arrows.  It is only difficult if you try to slay them all at
once. You become stone because there are too
many choices.  By reflection, find the arrow's destiny.

I will point you to the resources you need.  You
must decide what to make of them.  Take your
time.  Enjoy it.  You do not have to become
the creature in the mirror.  Sing for your heart.

Who Am I?

Len Bullard:  musician, father and husband,
systems analyst and defense contractor.
If you have problems with that last bit, I can
only say this on the subject and I will not
debate it or repeat it.  

Our society sends 18 year old children to war.

This is bad.  We must stop it.

When we cannot stop it, we must try to provide
them what will enable them to return alive,
else we turn away from our beloved ones.

War is wrong.  To turn away is also wrong.

I realize Kate would disapprove of me for this.
That is why hers are eyes I shall not see in this life,
for that disapproval would shatter me like a hammer to
a glass.  Yet, for memories of faces that remain
when souls have departed, for my son or daughter
who might some terrible day be asked to go,
I cannot turn away.  Selah.

Forgive me, Beloved Teacher.  Your way cannot be mine.

How to Proceed?

Because it is unfair to crowd the noospace of
others with things which are not to their tastes,
HOTFP posts will have subject headers that
allow you to filter them.  Posts on this subject will
always have the same major or dominant subject
morph:  HOTFP

o  HOTFP - House of the Future Project

These may be followed by a minor or subdominant
topic morph.  I will explain these as needed.  The one
above is BLUPUS (read, Blue Puss. Long story.).

o  BLUPUS - By Little Understandings, Proceed Until Satisfied.
                     ^   ^       ^                       ^            ^       ^

In the HOTFP, BLUPUS is the pedagogy, or lesson strategy,
It means "little lessons" that when understood, impart
a technique which can be added to your bag of techniques.
Used together, they enable you to create something.
Musicians sometimes refer to these collectively as "chops".

To learn to build worlds, we can do as Kate does in
the studio:  little experiments.  Each experiment
results in a thingie which we might or might not
use in building a world.  It is easy to build a world,
but it is more difficult to know when it is done, when
to rest.  So, the last bit:  Proceed Until Satisfied.  As Kate
herself often demonstrates, she is the boss, she
is the creator.  She chooses.  So should you.
When you are satisfied, stop.

Most artists work something like that, but it is tedious
and takes a lot of time.  It takes as long as it takes.
Those who wonder what Kate does between albums
will probably discover she spends a lot of time
doing little experiments and studying.  This is how
one acquires chops.

I am also taught.  Some very fine individuals in
the VRML community are teaching me and others
and to repay my debt, to help further their 
dream, a dream of a Garden,  I will help you learn as well.
VRML was created for efforts exactly such as this.
It is the good we do for one another.

Each teacher brought something to Kate's chops:
techniques, ideas, visions, emotions, symbols,
all of this and more.  Because acquiring VRML
chops is how we learn to make worlds for the
HOTFP, VRML will be the ball.  To those
who are interested, I will be rolling the ball to you!

Enough rant.  Tomorrow, a real example and
some addresses of where you can get free
browsers, objects, and some books you might want.

Until the Future.

I don't need any kind of chemical substances. 

Just being rolled over by the Ninth Wave suffices. :-)

During the first listenings I was really afraid of 
waking the witch. :-/

But as I like surreal paintings, I finally stopped being
afraid and just entered it.  

Ooh, its so wonderful watching you without me!
And in the morning fog I dream of sheep under ice. :-)

I pity those that dare not experience this jig of life.

But I can understand it as it requires a firm sense of reality
not to get lost there completely.  ;-)

Hi!

during my recent holiday I found some things some people might have searched
for quite a while:

- 2 copies of
  "A Visual Documentary"
  and 2 copies of
  "Secret History of Kate Bush (And The Strange Art Of Pop)",
  both in Tower Records in New Orleans (next to Hard Rock Cafe)
- another copy of the MiniDiscs for The Sensual World and The Red Shoes,
  as well as a Japanese boxed set ($195),
  all in HMV in Washington DC (Georgetown)

Bye,

Hi!

Chris said about Kate and Marmite:
&gt;     Yes, she did spend 6 months in Australia when she was very
&gt; young. But six months is not generally considered enough time
&gt; for a non-native to develop a tolerance to substances scraped
&gt; from the bottom of beer brewing vats.

;-)

Which reminds me of a question nagging in my head for a long, long,
long time (gee - there's a question the FAQ-keeper can't answer! 8-O ):

Did they go to Oz (and back) by plane or by ship?

Ship would have needed QUITE a bit of time for just half a year.

Bye,

Uli

&gt;&gt; Whoops!  I meant Rebecca.  Not Now Voyager!  Sorry about 
&gt;&gt; that.  It was Alfred Hitchcock's first movie and I can
&gt;&gt; definitely see Miranda playing the evil servant very well.
&gt; 
&gt; "Rebecca" was Hitchcock's twenty-fifth movie.

I think that the first was =The Lodger=, based upon a roommate that
I once had. (Very messy business, that.  Cooked in the room, and
you'll never guess =what= he cooked!)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oops!  Sorry!  Sorry for two reasons.  First, =you= were not
&gt;&gt;&gt; originally supposed to be getting =any= of the spam.  The program
&gt;&gt;&gt; used a hash-value such that your ID and that of Stev0, had the same
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash value.   [... snip]

&gt; 
&gt; Okay, okay, enough already.  Where are the smiley's?

The Smileys have divorced.  She was carrying on with an agent of
the KGB, or somesuch.  In any event, considering that the core topic
is Spam, the dialogue calls for Mr Yuck.

&gt;                                                       "What's all this,
&gt; then?"

That is a deep philosophical question.  Bring an electric torch with
you.

&gt;         Who is Daniel Kian Mc Kiernan?

This is a somewhat shallower philosophical question.  Bring a shovel
with you.

&gt;                                         Has he assumed the humble
&gt; pseudo-moderator-hood from Bill Wisner?

Mr Wisner is =not= a hood, a thug, nor a sharpie.  He is, however,
rumored to have connections with unsavory elements of the Tibetan
Freemasons.

&gt;                                          Is this, like, tag-team
&gt; wrestling?

No.  A more apt metaphor would be stochastic palimpsest evasion.

&gt; I've got some ideas about moderation...more later, maybe.

Okay.  But keep it in ASCII.
