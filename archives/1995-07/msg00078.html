I never said feminism was a dirty word. I just hate all gender-warfare
politics. And I think that Kate's negative comments on feminism (I have the
magazine, it was an edition of VOX) derive from that not uncommon instinct.
All ideologues, whether feminist, anti-feminist, post-feminist,or masculist,
or whatever pretentious label they decide to call themselves, are as bad as
each other in putting forward silly bogus arguments for the sake of
polarizing society along gender lines. That sort of thing belongs with
debates on political correctness and nutcases like Rush Lamebrain.
	And Kate's music, most of the time, is not overtly political. And
feminism is a political ideology. As kbfreak said at the end of the the post
that started this, Kate just wants to be herself. Not feminist, not
post-feminist, not anti-feminist, just herself. So discussions on any kind of
political ideology is not relevant to the board, because that is not what
Kate's about.
