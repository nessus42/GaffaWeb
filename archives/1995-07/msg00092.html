<PRE>
in the new Q magazine (April 95) there is an article called "Ker-Ching" that
looks at how much rock stars make, etc. Under the sub-heading: "Kate Bush's
Pension Plan":

"Pensions are a serios business for pop stars. They get lots of money when
they're young and not so much probably when they're old, unless they've put a
lot of their income into pensions. Pensions also happen to be a good way of
saving tax and preserving wealth for the future at the same time. Kate Bush
makes huge pension contributions. In 1992, for example, she paid herself
&amp;130,000 in fees but her total pension contributions were &amp;223,000. In 1989
she'd put &amp;476,000 into the pension fund.But last year she stopped. She'd
probably over-funded it. There's only so much you can put into a pension fund.
The money she's put in will have saved her a third in tax, so rather than pay
away that money, given the fact that she doesn't need it, she'd say, OK, I'll
put it into the pension. She could retire at 50, or 45, and by that time she'd
have a few million pounds in the fund, so that'll do nicely for the rest of her
life. She wouldn't have to perform again--not that she does anyway, haha!"

all quotes courtesy of the guy who wrote the book that the article draws from.
It goes on a bit and lists Kate's pension payments 1985-1992, which total close
to a million and a half pounds as of 1992. . . . yeesh! i think this sheds some
light on an earlier thread, months old now, about kate vs. tori and record
sales and blah blah blah . . . . the old gel is doing ok for herself. . . . .
not madonna, but who'd want to be?!
