I see you can't read. I did recieve several replies that disagreed with 
my original posting, and I found them to be intelligent and well-written 
arguements. However, I don't find out and out criticisms of myself, my 
arguements and feminism in general to be intelligent. If that's a 
condescending statement, than I'm a snide little so and so. But I think 
it's the truth for most people. I'd be more than happy to debate the pros 
and cons of modern feminism and how it relates to Kate Bush, but not 
with people who outright dismisss my ideas without back up. Would you? If 
you were having a discussion with some people about say religion, and 
some one else joined in and said your ideas were basically all false, 
wouldn't you have the right to criticize them?

If you want to further discuss the matter, please do it by e-mail so as 
not to bother those who aren't interested in our debates
