	G'day again,

zeak@wet.UUCP (George Todd) writes:

&gt;I was just wondering if any other KT fan-natics have the same problem with TSW that I have. Namely I hate it.
&gt;I LOVE everything else Saint Kate has done, but that one leaves me blank.
&gt;Comments?

	Do you really want to start up this discussion again?!?!

	For what it's worth though:

	I do like TSW. I agree it may not be as good as her other albums
but hey, her other albums are pretty hard to beat so why not just take the 
album as it is and enjoy instead of comparing them! Naturally, I concede, 
that comparison of an artist's work always accompanies any new release. It 
therefore depends on whether you are a Kate fan or a fan of her music. As for
myself I am both so I don't compare albums I just listen to the one I feel like
listening to at the time.

	On the other hand, you probably have not listened to it enough. In 
which case, just sit down and listen to it. I don't mean pull it apart and 
analyse it (I'm not saying you would do this) but let it MOVE you! Kate works
on an EMOTIONAL level and you have to listen to the album in this way. 
So just listen to it and I'm sure every time you do you will find something 
new in every song. I'm not saying you haven't done this, just that it is 
possible. You may end up having to ask yourself WHY you like Kate's earlier
music. If it is the same reason as myself (i.e. because it appeals to the 
emotions rather that logic, and I'm a programmer so I need this release) 
then you may end up having a different view of TSW.

	Some Kate fans on this group have said that the "inferior" quality
of TSW could be due to Del Palmer's influence. Hmmm. Del's a musician, and
not a bad one at that, but maybe it could have something to do with equipment.
Anyone know what equipment such as synths or sequencers were used?

	Please don't flame me too hard!

	Bye!
