&gt;
&gt;     Last Saturday, Suzanne played at the Norris Center (I think!) at
&gt;NorthWestern University.  
&gt;     It was a stage on the "backyard" of a university building.  There were
&gt;approximately 200 people there, mostly on blankets in windy 40 degree
&gt;weather.  The concert was an hour and a half with two encores (it was _darn_
&gt;cold.)  She did seem to cover everything equally, although I would have
&gt;preferred more of her earlier songs.  It was a nice personal concert. 

Ours was in the Michigan Theater, which seats about, oh, 700 or so.
(A guess.)  The length was the same - sounds like we heard the same stuff.

&gt;     The concert was also free!  The intro band was called the "Gravity
&gt;Beavers."  Odd name, but good band.  Their songs were a bit repetitive and
&gt;not too engaging, but they were very good acoustic guitar players, and their
&gt;songs were good, too.  Anyone heard of these guys?  They were kindof an
&gt;acoustic, slightly folky, REM.  Something like that.

You lucky bastards!  I spent $22.50 on a ticket, and you saw her for FREE?
And we didn't even get an opening band!

&gt;     Suzanne said that someone the night before (or a couple of nights, I
&gt;can't rightly remember) danced naked on a table and had to be taken away.
&gt;Was that your Michigan concert?  And I thought the UofI was wierd.  ;-)

No, I certainly don't remember seeing that.  For a start, there weren't
any tables.  &gt;8)

And apologies for the multiple post, but my system connection bombed on
me while I was typing, and I couldn't tell if it had gotten through.

We hang on to every line, and walk straight down the middle of it.
