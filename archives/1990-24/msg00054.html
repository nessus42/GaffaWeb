Vickie here, I'm upset so you'll have to excuse me.

Someone who shall remain nameless wrote:
&gt;&gt;   She may not be a Scientologist, but there were a lot of Homeopathy
&gt;&gt; rumors going around the net last spring. . .
Someone else who shall remain nameless wrote: 
&gt; Not to stir up the controversy again, but could someone please tell me wot 
&gt; that conversation was all about, and wot the general consensus in the end 
&gt; was?

                 Let's nip this in the bud straight away



              KATE IS        NOT         A SCIENTOLIGIST !!!!!!!!

              KATE IS        NOT         INTO HOMEOPATHY !!!!!!!!



I had to do it that way because I know that many people tend to tune
into Love-Hounds and then skim the posts. They might pick up words and 
phrases here and there and then get what the post was about mixed up in
their minds. I absolutely SHUDDER at the thought that anyone would go away
from these (possibly half-read) posts and then think that Kate's stupid
enough to be a Scientoligist. I despise/detest/abhor/hate/loathe/distain/
abominate and condemn Scientology. Yes, I went to my Thesaurus for that one!
If I ever found out that she was one of those scum....I swear that it's
the ONLY thing that would make me give up her music. Down and in the trash
would go all the posters. Out would go all the records and the name of my
show would be immediately changed! Since she's an intelligent person though
I don't expect that to ever happen. But the thought of it gives me horrible
nightmares!!!!

Whoever first brought it up owes me a few nights sleep!

Again, for the benefit of skimmers:




             KATE IS        NOT      A SCIENTOLIGIST !!!!!!!!!!

             KATE IS        NOT      INTO HOMEOPATHY !!!!!!!!!!

and...       KATE IS        NOT      INTO GURDJIEFF  !!!!!!!!!!




...or wood nymphs or faeries or moon cheese worship or anything else
of the sort. 
And if there's to be any more discussion of Homeopathy, PLEASE do it via
e-mail. We've been through it all before.


Blood boiling and heart racing, I remain:
Vickie (one of Vickie'n'Chris)

grrrrrrrr!!!!!
