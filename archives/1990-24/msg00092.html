Hello, Love-Hounds! It's good to be back among the Kate fans of the
world!
   IED is back, complete with his annoying use of the third person
and all those other obnoxious personality traits that you've grown
to know and deplore over the years! 
   Note: Though IED's e-mail address has changed, his ID will remain
IED for tradition's sake. 
   IED was delighted to see how healthy Love-Hounds continues to be.
The news of the boxed set of KT CDs (IED gathers the title is 
rumored to be "This Woman's Work"?) and, perhaps even more exciting,
the plans for _many_ U.S. fans to travel to England and attend
the November 17 International Kate Bush Convention together, are 
certain to be stimulants to KT discourse in Love-Hounds for weeks
to come. 
   IED is not certain yet, but he is making every effort to arrange
to join the other Love-Hounds and Kate fans at large in London on
the 17th November. He would _hate_ to miss out on such a magical
occasion. It would be really nice to meet Neil Calton, Love-Hounds's
veteran Senior KorrespondenT in the UK; as it would be to re-meet
Michael Butler, Vickie and Chris, Larry "Lionheart" Hernandez,
and Ed Suranyi--great and sincere Kate fans all! 
   IED hopes that our Washington State KontingenT will somehow
find a way to represent themselves at the Convention, and that
even our much-too-busy-for-most-Kate-Bush-stuff Pseudo-Moderator,
Douglas Alan, may conspire to stowaway or something in order
to make a re-appearance on the KT Con Center Stage for a Trivia
KonTest re-match. And Derek, what about you? Can you make it? 
   IED will be reading Love-Hounds with enthusiasm for news of
other pilgrims. Meanwhile, he wishes you all the best.
   	
-- Andrew Marvick 
   P.S.: Tracy, can you come too? Deb Wentorf, what about you?
Tippi Chai, if you're still reading this, can you make it? Jon
S. Drukman (see, IED is in such a good mood he even used your
whole name, Jon), Joe Turner, have you bought your airline tickets
yet? Etc., etc., all those whose names IED can't think of right 
now--hope you can make it!
