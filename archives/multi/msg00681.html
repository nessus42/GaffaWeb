&gt;&gt; Really-From: Bob Knight &lt;KNIGHT@SRI-NIC.ARPA&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Aha!  Dan, we seem to have a lot of likes in common.  M+M is one of my faves
&gt;&gt; and has been for years.  Danseparc is great, but Metro Music and This Is The
&gt;&gt; Ice Age are real fine, too.  It's been about 1.5 years since Mystery Walk,
&gt;&gt; are they still together and recording?  

&gt; Really-From: Jordan Hayes &lt;jordan@ames.ARPA&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yow! Great band -- get Metro Music; it's better than Danseparc

I have all five albums by Martha and the Muffins, and consider _Danseparc_
to be far and away the best of the lot.  It's one of those records where
everything is right, from the tunes themselves to their order on the record
and the segueing between some of them.  _Mystery Walk_ was number two by
my rating but _This is the Ice Age_ is quickly replacing it.  _Metro Music_
is just ok by me, and _Trance and Dance_ doesn't do a thing for me.

What follows is a complete discography of M+M's LPs for those like me who 
enjoy reading such things.  I'm not sending it to net.music because I don't 
want to read two month's worth of discussion about my spelling errors or 
bickering about my poor taste in music or any of the other net.music drivel 
that's causing me to be about this --&gt; &lt;-- close to de-subscribing.  Sorry for 
the flaming.  On with the show, this is it...

It's interesting to note that the band personnel and producer stayed the same 
for the first two records, then on number three Martha Johnson left and the 
Lanois' appeared.  Daniel Lanois' co-production and treatments seem to be what 
starts to make M+M's sound appeal to me.  Also note that on number three, Mark
Gane's other brother Nick appears.  On number four Tim Gane leaves and is re-
placed by Nick Kent on drums.  Also, Daniel Lanois is given first billing on
production, WITH M. Gane and M. Johnson.  This is also the first place where
there is reference to "M+M" in addition to "Martha and the Muffins" (on the 
back cover only).  On number five the band permanently becomes M+M, which I feel
is refering to Mark + Martha, versus "Martha and the Muffins".  In fact, they
are the only original members, with Daniel Lanois still getting a "with" bill-
ing.  The production credits now go to Lanois, Gane AND Johnson.

I don't know what Gane and Johnson are up to these days, but Lanois is starting
to produce for other folks.  He co-produced U2's _The Unforgettable Fire_ along
with Brian Eno, and I've seen his name elsewhere recently.  I'd love an album
from Mark Gane;  his guitar work and treatments are very tasty.

There you have it.  Everything you ever wanted to know about M+M, and never
asked for.

Dan
