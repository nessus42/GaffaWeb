			Kate Bush Rarities
			------------------

I was asked by Jeff Richardson to compile a list of songs that Kate Bush
has recorded, but which do not appear on any of her albums.  This is
nearly everything I know about (I think):


Singles and singles B-sides:
---------------------------

"Passing Through Air" (1980) -- "Recorded in 1973 on a sunny afternoon
	at Dave's."  On B-side of "Army Dreamers".

"The Empty Bullring" (1980) -- B-side to "Breathing".

"December Will Be Magic Again" (1980) -- An Xmas song.  Only released as a
	single.  One of Kate's best songs!

"Warm And Soothing" (1980) -- B-side to "December Will Be Magic Again".

"Ran Tan Waltz" (1980) -- B-side to "Babooshka".  Much, much better than
	"Babooshka"!

"Lord of The Reedy River" (1981) -- Cover of the Donovan song.  B-side
	to "Sat In Your Lap".

"Dreamtime" (1982) -- Instrumental version of "The Dreaming" -- quite
	different and wonderful.  B-side to "The Dreaming" and
	"Suspended In Gaffa".

"Ne T'Enfuis Pas" (1982) -- B-side to "There Goes A Tenner".  Also
	released as a single.  Also on the Canadian "Kate Bush" EP, but
	not on the U.S. version.

"Un Baiser D'Enfant" (1983) -- B-side to "Ne T'Enfuis Pas".  A French
	version of "The Infant Kiss".  Also on the "Kate Bush" EP.

All of the songs up to this point can be found in a boxed set of 7 inch
records called "Kate Bush: The Single File 1978-1983".  It contains
a pamphlet with pictures and lyrics and thirteen records: The Man With
the Child In His Eyes, Kate Bush On Stage (EP), Hammer Horror, Ne
T'Enfuis Pas, Army Dreamers, December Will Be Magic Again, There Goes A
Tenner, Wow, The Dreaming, Babooshka, Breathing, Wuthering Heights, and
Sat In Your Lap.  It often sells for up to $50, but a record store near
hear is selling them for $19.99:

		Rockit Records
		Route One North
		Augustine's Plaza
		Saugus, MA
		(617) 233-7805

"Under The Ivy" (1985) -- B-side to "Running Up That Hill".  One of
	Kate's very best and emotionally powerful songs!

"Running Up That Hill (Extended Version)" (1985) -- 12 inch single.

"Running Up That Hill (Instrumental Version)" (1985) -- On B-side of
	"Running Up That Hill (Extended Version)".


Kate Appears On Others' Records
-------------------------------

"You (The Game Part II) The two halves in Flight" -- A duet sung by Roy
	Harper and Kate Bush.  Written by Roy Harper and David Gilmour.
	Appears on Roy Harper's album "The Unknown Soldier".  An
	*amazing* song!

"No Self Control"  -- On Peter Gabriel's third album.  Kate sings
	background vocals.

"Games Without Frontiers"  -- On Peter Gabriel's third album.  Kate
	sings the line "Jeux sans frontieres", which everyone thinks is
	"She's so funky, yeah".

"FLOWERS" -- On an album called "FIGVRES" by Zaine Griff.  Kate sings
	very prominent backing vocals.  Very nice song!

Kate also sings background vocals on a song by Leslie Duncan, but I've
	never heard it or seen it anywhere.


Very Rare Stuff
---------------

"Another Day" -- Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel do a duet version of Roy
	Harper's wonderful song "Another Day".  This is from Kate's BBC
	Xmas special that was broadcast in 1979 and is not on any record
	(except bootleg).  "Another Day" has also recently been covered
	exceedingly well by This Mortal Coil on their album "It'll End
	In Tears".

"Egypt" -- A live version of the song from Kate Bush's 1979 concert
	tour.  This is *totally* different from the version on "Never
	for Ever".  Not on any record (except bootleg).

"Let It Be" -- Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, and Steve Harley covered this
	during one of Kate's concerts in 1979.  Not on any record
	(except bootleg).

A song in a movie called "The Magician of Lublin" -- Kate sings a song
	written by Maurice Jarre.  It is used as background music in the
	film, and I haven't yet found it in any other form.


Exceedingling Rare
------------------

I'd commit mass murder to get any of these.  PLEASE tell me if you ever
find them anywhere!

"Maybe" -- In 1975 David Gilmour produced a demo tape for Kate Bush to
	give to EMI to help her get her recording contract.  Two of the
	three songs on that demo tape were taken directly from that tape
	and put on "The Kick Inside":  "Saxaphone Song" and "The Man
	With The Child In His Eyes".  The third song "Maybe" was never
	released, but I have about 20 seconds of it from a radio show
	where Kate was interviewed and they played a little bit of it.

Kate did another Xmas song and gave it to radio stations to play, but
	she says that she is not aware of any station having ever played
	it, nor was it ever released.

It is said that before Kate met David Gilmour she made a very rough demo
	tape at home containing 50 songs!  She sent this off to record
	companies, but it didn't produce any response.  I guess it
	doesn't hurt to have David Gilmour on your side....

All of the tons of demos, experiments, alternate versions, unreleased
	songs, and other stuff that is lying around in Kate's closets
	that we will never get to hear!
