Re: David Hockney and others

	Disclaimer: I'm not an experienced artist!

	Anyway, my impression of David Hockney's (yeah, he's British)
use of colors is basically the same as Greg's, i.e., bright and 
brilliant. I recall seeing many paintings of his depicting swimming
pools on sunny days with lots of bright blues and lighter colors. For
a while, I thought that all he painted were swimming pools :-). He
does neat things with splashing and moving water, and the movement of
swimmers. When I was young and naive, I wanted to take photos that
look like David Hockney paintings...

	Did anyone read the Sunday New York Times review on Kate Bush
and Jane Siberry (Oct. 20)? It was written by John Rockwell, who also
wrote the excellent book All-American Music (which I reviewed a few
months ago). Rockwell has to be an objective critic with good taste,
since he likes Velvet Underground, Talking Heads and Laurie Anderson
:-) :-) (there are chapters on TH and LA in his book). Rockwell liked
Siberry better than Suzanne Vega (because of Siberry's music) but
thinks Kate has a better chance of doing well in the US. He doesn't 
like Kate's lyrics (uh oh; well, we can't all be perfect) but likes
her use of the synthesiser and the electronic processing of her voice.
He was disappointed with the RUTH video (it sounds like he's been a
Kate Bush fan for a while) but has high hopes for the Ninth Wave video.
Of course MTV will never play a 20 minute video --- and there are
no "alternative" video stations in Lafayette, Indiana. Sigh.

	Saw an interesting video last night: Dream Academy's This World.
The music is much more interesting than what I've heard before from 
this group, kind of sixty-ish with nice woodwinds. Is their new album
worth getting? What's the story on these guys?

	No replies to my Eno query about Zawinul Lava yet (any connection
to jazz pianist Zawinul?) Maybe I'll have to post to net.music :-).
