&gt;From: Doug Alan &lt;nessus&gt;

&gt;That's what I thought sounded like "Really see".  This is the part that
&gt;if you play it backwards, it still sounds the same.  I don't know much
&gt;French either, but I think "It's here" would be "C'est ici" and "I'm not
&gt;here" would be "Juis suis ici"....

Not quite -- "I'm not here" would be "Je ne suis pas ici."  I'm not sure if
that's what she's saying though -- have to listen to it again tonight.

Speaking of foreign-sounding passages, does anyone know what Kate is saying
at the end of "Hello Earth"  (at least, I think it's "Hello Earth")?  Sounds
like German to me, but I can't quite make it out.  Nothing I have come up 
with makes sense.

&gt;But I know why I dreamt of the train -- after Doug explained about
&gt;"Orgone", everything in "Cloudbusting" made sense, except the very end
&gt;where you sort of hear a train stopping and a whistle being blown.  Is there
&gt;something you're not telling us, Doug?

Geez, I never received that "Orgone" explanation you're referring to.  Problems
with uucp links, I suppose.  Still, would you mind re-posting that article?

&gt;From: Doug Alan &lt;nessus&gt;

&gt;But actually, I also found "The Kick Inside" (which I bought several
&gt;months after "The Dreaming") to be pretty abrasive!  I certainly wasn't
&gt;expecting that above-soprano brittle wailing voice!

Can it be??  Sounds like criticism.  The other day, while leafing through the
Rolling Stone Magazine Review of Music (title?) I read something to the
effect that KB sounded like the combination of Patti Smith and a Hoover vacuum
cleaner.  While I don't agree with that assessment (still, I think it's kind of
funny), I do feel her first two albums are rather mundane.  As for her 
latest, I have mixed feelings.  I think the first 3 songs of HoL are kind of
dull (especially "Big Sky") -- might appeal to the masses though.  "Jig of 
Life" is a definite favourite.   The second side is, on the whole, very good.

&gt;I just saw RUTH for the first time, on U68, a UHF video channel...

When????  I noticed they seem to run the same sequence of videos several nights
in a row.  Generally pretty bad stuff, but I did see Joan Armatrading last 
night, which gave me hope.  Have yet to see RUTH though, despite its apparent 
popularity.  

&gt;First, where can I get more of her material?  I live very close to New
&gt;York City, but can anyone suggest specific record shops?

If you live in NJ, it's available at Sam Goody's in Monmouth Mall (they
have a new shipment of the marbled edition [KB goes tacky] and a few CDs
as of Sunday).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh yeah, I bought Suzanne Vega a few months ago after reading rave reviews
in net.music .. think it's terrific.  Reminds me of Joni Mitchell's Hejira
album -- wonderful ballads.  Anyway, I recommended both SV and KB's HoL to 
a friend with similar tastes to mine.  The reaction -- she *loves* SV and 
absolutely *loathes* KB.  Thought you might be interested...
