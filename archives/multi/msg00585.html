&gt;From ins_aset@jhunix Mon Nov 11 17:35:05 1985 remote from jhunix
Date:     Mon, 11 Nov 85 17:34:48 EST
From:     Susanne E Trowbridge &lt;ins_aset@jhunix&gt;
Subject:   Concert Reviews: R.E.M., Del Fuegos, etc.

Well, I just got back from the CMJ MUSIC MARATHON in New York City.
This event was a convention for people in the record industry, from
college radio to big-time record company types.  The "highlight" of
the convention was supposed to be the New Music Awards, held Saturday
night at the beautiful Beacon Theatre.

Plenty of awards were given out, including T-Bone Burnett as best
producer (??? what the heck did he produce besides Marshall Crenshaw's
latest ???), Tina Turner as best female vocalist (ugh!), Bryan Ferry
as best male vocalist (!!!!), and R.E.M.'s "Fables," best LP.

However, the main thing was the live music that was featured between
the awards.  The Del Fuegoes were dreadful, but what do you expect
from a band that sold their souls to Miller Beer?  I was really looking
forward to R.E.M., because I've been a fan of theirs ever since "Radio
Free Europe," and this was my first time seeing them live.  Unfortunately,
they all came out carrying acoustic guitars, and for about a half hour,
all they did was play moldy oldies and some of their own songs, such as
"Driver 8" and "Time After Time," none of which sounded particularly
good on acoustic guitars.

When they finally ditched the acoustics, they were great!  Especially
hot was their version of "Can't Get There From Here."  Imagine my
disappointment when they left after a mere three non-acoustic songs!!
The audience stomped and clapped until Michael Stipe came back on...
he then said, "That's it for tonight, but I would like to sing a song,"
and went into an a capella version of "Moon River"! Gawd!

You'd think R.E.M. would have the decency to give a better performance
for the college radio people who made their last LP a 300,000 seller.
&gt;From the interviews I've read with R.E.M., they sound like neat guys,
but now I really have to wonder.  They're going to be here in Baltimore
next month and I'm debating whether or not I should see them.  I
don't think I could take another acoustic set.

I'd like to say more about the Music Marathon, but it really has nothing
to do with Kate Bush...well, I do hope she wins the best vocalist award
at next year's ceremony, and that they get a better band to play.  Too
bad I won't be there...oh, my poor beloved station...
