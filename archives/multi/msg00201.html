I saw Jane Siberry last nite at the 9:30 club here in DC.  The show was
incredibly fantastic!!

Starting time was supposed to be 8:00, but the club never starts shows on
time, so I got there at 8:45.  The band didn't come on until 10:15.
Apparently they were just late getting there; something about video
equipment.

The band lineup was: one guitarist, one drummer, one synth player, two
backup singers, and Jane Siberry.  Jane, the synth player, and one of the
backup singers would play percussion sometimes.  They were a happy band --
they smiled all they way through the set.

I'd never heard Jane Siberry before, except the song ``Symmetry'', but I'm
definitely going to go out and buy the album.  I also bought a T-shirt.
Most critics say that she sounds like a pop Laurie Anderson.  Some of her
lyrics are definitely influenced by Anderson, but they also sound like
Suzanne Vega and Patti Smith.  The music, however, was totally original.
Weird rhythms, but very danceable (I did!).

The crowd was more excited than I've ever seen at the 9:30 club.  By the
middle of the set, she was getting as much applause for each song as most
bands do for a whole set.  People kept yelling (rather silly) things out,
like ``Jane is a goddess'' (and then someone else yelled ``Patti Smith and
Laurie Anderson are two!'', and the original person said ``Shut up, you
asshole!'').

She did one encore (didn't even bother leaving the stage!).  The show ended
at about 11:45, and she got a *lot* of applause.

Apparently she is playing the East Coast, then going back up across Canada,
and down the West Coast.  If you get a chance to see her, *definitely* do
so.  You won't regret it...
