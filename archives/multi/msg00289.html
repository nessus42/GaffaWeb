Today I logged in and found 77kb of mail, mostly from the love-hounds
list.  phew.  I think I'll add to it.  However &lt;doug!&gt; I'd like to
suggest that if you post something to net.music, refrain from sending
it along this list also.  Is that reasonable &lt;qm&gt;.  (my questionmark
key doesn't work.)

Comments on the new KB album:  First of all, I bought the Hounds of Love
CD on Sunday, two days after the album was officially released.  I bought
it at a place called Boston Compact Disc in Cambridge Mass., which
incidentally is a really nice place if you take into account how valuable
space is in Harvard Square.  In other words, it is cramped but they've got
some interesting ways to get around that.  While my friend and I were each
buying our copies of the CD, I asked the guy at the counter if they'd sold
many.  Eleven so far, he said.  Not including our two.  And I could see
seven more on the shelf.  I asked how it happened that they'd stocked so many
copies of this album, given that Kate Bush has not been extremely popular
in the past.  He said a) around here (harvard square) she is popular, and
b) we KNEW.  I guess a lot of people had been coming in asking if the album
was out yet.  Probably it was Doug coming in every 3 minutes.

And the album: I have been playing it Constantly.  it really grabs you.
each song, once you get into it, is different than it sounds like it is
starting out to be.  (I am one of those that LIKE the synth line in RUTH).
I had to laugh at the vocal background in the title song-- human voices
imitating dog howling/baying.  It is quite effective-- I didn't notice it
at first.  Another thing that I didn't notice is that in the song "Watching
you Without Me" (which while I listen to it is my favorite, like many of the
others) at about 2:06 into the song there is a morse code sequence in the
background which spells out "SOS" three times.  "SOS" is the international
distress signal, in case you don't know.  Save Our Souls.

There's been a lot said about how great it is.  I agree.  I love the picture
on the back cover, it is wonderful.  BUT!  I really don't think that it
was recorded very well.  It may be that I have a bad copy.  The level is
extremely high-- and it seems to come out sounding flat as a result.  About
26 seconds into the last song there is a very bad sounding stretch.  Again,
maybe it is just my copy.


I had a lot more to respond to but I've forgotten it.  (lucky you).  "and the
band played on" is from a very old song (30's maybe) which began "casey would
dance with the strawberry blond; and the band played on".  

Yours Truly
