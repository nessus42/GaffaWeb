These are the lyrics to Kate's two new songs as heard by the
semi-reliable ears of Doug Alan:

	BURNING BRIDGE
	--------------

	Oh, come close to me
	Come cross the bridge
	I need to know what you have to say to me
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	What have you got to say to me?
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	Tell me all about it
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	Tell me please
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	Woe, I know
	I know what works for me
	So cross the bridge
	The burning bridge
	With friends behind us
	From the line
	It's you and me, baby, against the world
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	I got to know what you have to say
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	What have you got to say?
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	Ooooooh
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	I got to get close now
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	Tell me all about it
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	All night long
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	All night long
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	It works for me
	It's you and me, baby
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	Against the world
	All night long
	It works for me
	Let's cross the bridge
	Oh, I know
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	I know I know
	(We've been waiting all night long)
	All night long
	It's you and me, baby
	I said "works for me"
	It's all right
	It's you and me, baby
	Against the world!

It sure seems like this might have been written for the HoL side of HoL.
It seems to be about overcoming depression by becoming intimate with
someone.  In some ways the lyrics remind me of Kate's earliest recorded
song "Passing Through Air" (1973) only more desperate: "Passing through
air, you mix the stars with your arms/ Walking through here, the doom of
eternity balms".

	MY LAGAN LOVE
	-------------

	When rainy nights are soft with tears
	And Autumn leaves are falling
	I hear his voice on tumbling waves
	And no one there to hold me
	At evening's fall he watched me walk
	His heart was mine
	But my love was young and felt
	The world was not cruel, but kind
	Where Lagan's light fell on the hour
	I saw him far below me
	Just as the morning calmed the storm
	With no one there to hold him
	My loves have come, my loves have gone
	And nothing's left to warn me
	Save for a voice on the traveling wind
	And the glimpse of a face at morning

What can one say?

-Doug
