&gt; From: bdmrrr!seismo!purdue-ecn.ARPA!hsut (Tsun-Yuk Hsu)
&gt; 
&gt; 	Just got Robyn Hitchcock's I Often Dream of Trains (partly at
&gt; Doug's suggestion.) What an album! I enjoyed Fegmania, but Trains
&gt; totally blew me away.

Yes yes yes yes yes!  I bought IODoT first, and then Fegmania.  I'm not sure
which one I like most -- it depends on the mood I'm in.  I will say,
however, that these are possibly the two best albums I have (sorry Doug, I
think they just went over The Dreaming).  In fact, I just listened to IODoT
today (not 2 hours ago).  I've been playing the same 5 albums for the last
two weeks, and two of them are Robyn Hitchcock.  (The others, in case you're
interested, are Jonathan Richman's ``Rockin' and Romance'' and ``Jonathan
Sings,'' and Martha &amp; the Muffins ``This is the Ice Age.'' (Soon I guess I'll
be listening to a lot of Jane Siberry, once I get the album.))

&gt; 	Like Fegmania, Trains has no lyric sheets. However, there is
&gt; some strange verse inside (which I've yet to figure out)

I typed in the verse to that onto this computer.  If you want me to send it,
I will.  There are a couple of words I can't make out, but maybe all the
other Hitchcock fans can help.

&gt; hilarious comic strip called 12'' Comix which I promise to read
&gt; carefully and analyze sometime.

``Black Snake Diamond Role,'' which I bought a couple of days ago, also has
strange comix in it.

&gt; The production is
&gt; uneven --- I had almost unbearable surface noise on a few songs. Were
&gt; some songs recorded in Robyn's bathroom or something (hence the occasional
&gt; mention of "toilets" :-) )? How was your copy, Doug?

Yeah, some of the tracks are definitely not-right.  Sorta sounds like they
were using crummy tape.

&gt; I loved all the songs on side 1 unreservedly. Side 2
&gt; seems almost "tired" by comparison. The theme here is death and dying,
&gt; and the pervading mood is an autumnal sadness.

Yeah, that's true.  But it's still great, just different.  `Trams of Old
London' and `I Often Dream of Trains' are some of the best tracks on the
album.
