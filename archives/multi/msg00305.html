Well... it turns out that the era of "The band played on" is not so vacuous
lyrically after all!  It's only that most people didn't remember them.
Following are the *complete* words to the song, which Jay Elvove sent to
me.

(I know this has little to do with Kate Bush, but, shucks, you must admit
it is interesting... I also have the words to 3 little fishes now, but
won't get into THAT unless someone is interested.)

Here it is, as promised, the complete lyrics to Charles B Ward's and
John F Palmer's song, "The Band Played On":

Matt Casey formed a social club that beat the town for style,
And hired for a meeting place a hall.
When payday came around each week they greased the floor with wax,
And danced with noise and vigor at the ball.
Each Saturday you'd see them dressed up in Sunday clothes;
Each lad would have his sweetheart by his side.
When Casey led the first grand march they all would fall in line
Behind the man who was their joy and pride.

Chorus:

   For Casey would waltz with a strawberry blonde,
   And the band played on.
   He'd glide cross the floor with the girl he adored,
   And the band played on.
   But his brain was so loaded it nearly exploded;
   The poor girl would shake with alarm.
   He'd nee'r leave the girl with the strawberry curls, 
   And the band played on. 

Such kissing in the corner and such whispering in the hall,
And telling tales of love behind the stairs.
As Casey was the favorite and he that ran the ball,
Of kissing and lovemaking did his share.
At twelve o'clock exactly they all would fall in line,
Then march down to the dining hall and eat.
But Casey would not join them although everything was fine,
But he stayed upstairs and exercised his feet.

Chorus:

Now when the dance was over and the band played "Home Sweet Home",
They played a tune at Casey's own request.
He thanked them very kindly for the favors they had shown,
Then he'd waltz once with the girl that he loved best.
Most all the friends are married that Casey used to know,
And Casey too has taken him a wife.
The blonde he used to waltz and glide with on the ballroom floor
Is happy Mrs. Casey now for life.

Chorus:

------------
Jay Elvove
(I love the old songs, too.)
