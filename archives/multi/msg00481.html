 Just found the following articles involving Kate Bush...

 &lt;1&gt; A review of HOL from my local paper back home.
 &lt;2&gt; Item in national paper concerning the making of the Cloudbusting video.

 ==============================================================================
 &lt;1&gt; Review of HOL from the Bexleyheath and Welling Observer, by Clive Goodman.
     Dated: October 17th.

 Under the Headline : Elfin Kate still at top.

 A three-year lay-off is a long time to be out of circulation, even if you are
one of the biggest-selling female singers ever to sprout up in the UK.
 Not that it seems to have made the slightest difference to the elfin one. 
Straight in with both the single and the album is no mean feat. No surprise 
though - because this is tailor-made for chart action. Harder and more 
rythmically positive than the early stuff - but still with that haunting,
ethereal quality that elevates La Bush above the chart hoi poloi.

 Its really two albums in one with "Hounds of Love" taking up the first side 
while the - ahem - conceptual "The Ninth Wave" hogs side two. First things first - and it leads out with the single verson of "Running Up That Hill" which
surpasses anything Bush has done previously in terms of romance, power and
rhythm. Then theres the wilder, less spartan "Hounds of Love" itself which 
throbs rather than rocks while those classic breathless vocals slide over
the top.

 But best of the lot is "Mother Stands for Comfort" with its spiky, stretched
tension and slabs of thick textured rhythm. The only sour note is slipping in
the 12-inch version of "Running" as a closer.(??) Cheap short that...

 Then over to side two for the more experimental, and the less sucessful,
"The Ninth Wave", based on a drowning mans impressions and illusions. Good
in sections, like the openers "And Dreams of Sheep" and the taut, atmospheric
"Under Ice" with its staggered strings and hard arrangement. But as a whole
its just a touch too complex and clever-dick to stand close inspection.

 As a whole though, "Hounds of Love" is hard to fault on any level - production
, by Bush herself, performance and writing...

Comments?

===============================================================================

&lt;2&gt; Item in "The Mirror" dated October 24th.
    Headline : Kates Haunting theme.

  SPOOKY singer Kate Bushs video team have been upset by a ghost. They had an
eerie time in their four days of filming at the White Horse Hill beauty spot
in Oxfordshire. 
 
  A local said yesterday : "They found it very disturing. They said they felt
there was someone watching them all the time - but there was no one there."
The hill is near Waylands Smithy where, according to legend, a ghostly
blacksmith waits to shoe the horses of travellers.

  The seven-minute video is for Kates new single Cloudbusting, which has just 
entered the charts. She plays 12-year-old Peter Reich, from whose Book of
Dreams she drew the idea for the song.
