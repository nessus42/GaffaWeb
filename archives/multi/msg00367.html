&gt; Will it help to convince you if I tell you that both Peter Morris (one of
&gt; the editors of Homeground, a KB fanzine) and I independently came to the
&gt; same conclusion?

No... I don't usually take people who use words like
"connundrum" [sic.] very seriously!

However, I guess your description is fairly convincing... I
think I will write to Kate Bush and say, "see, here is this
alternative interpretation I have come up with."  I only hope
she is more responsive than whoever that other person I wrote to
was, or Ms. X.

&gt; I should also point out that the promo video (not the one being shown on
&gt; MTV) perfectly matches this interpretation.

But, the videos rarely have anything to do with the songs!

&gt; There are hills and a road and a building and lovers, but no construction
&gt; workers and no jogging.

Well... maybe... I think too much is made of "lovers" in songs
these days... I wish she would write songs about something else.
That's the good thing about Yes, and Genesis back in Peter
Gabriel's time, and Pink Floyd... they have a more diversified
view of life... however, I guess the other songs make up for
it...

&gt; 	It's also
&gt; 	perhaps talking about some of the fundamental differences
&gt; 	between men and woman.

I think this is what the song is really about.

Today's puzzle:

If Kate Bush is such a nice person, why does she call police
"pigs"?
