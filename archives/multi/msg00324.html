$Subject:  Henry Rollins poetry reading.

&gt;For you punk socialities, Ian and Brian Baker of Minor Threat were there. 
&gt;For being such jerks in public, they wrote some decent songs.

I bet they would have behaved if *their* parents were there.  I take Henry
was I good boy and drink any of his sweat though?

Hey, Tim, do you have a Minor Threat discography?  Do you think they'll
ever reform or will they become millionair record executives.  What compilation
or 7" is 1-2-3-X-U on?  (I think that is the name.)

$Subject: An Experiment

&gt;Only Pink Floyd fans need read on, the rest of you can
&gt;skip this. 

I hope your experiment is successful.  I've always wondered what they were
saying!  I read a review of the newly remixed Woodstock album and Bart
Bull, hater of hippies, says he can hear Crosby say to Stills - "Is
the joint ready for the electric set?".  I wonder what gems can be heard
on the CD of this.

$Subject: Kate Bush interview on WBCN!

&gt;There was a live telephone interview with Kate Bush on WBCN on Friday
&gt;and I missed it!  Aaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhh!

&gt;			-Doug

A KATE BUSH Event that Doug Alan missed or didn't tape ???  This is really the 
fun-people, right?

$Subject: Strange messages, Backward vocals, Pink Floyd, and Kate Bush


&gt;("Breathing" on the Greenpeace album also sounds like it's mixed
&gt;differently than on the record of "Never for Ever"....)

Speaking of new mixes, I understand Bruce Cockburn's album - The Trouble
with Normal, has been released in the US (It was previously an import).  The
title song was completely redone.  I first thought it was a remix but
constant comparision indicates this is not true.  Anyone else out their like
Cockburn?  Why wasn't he on the Greenpeace (or was he and I just missed
his name?)?  It seems like his type of project.

&gt;&gt; Course, The Wall is undeniably my favorite album....

&gt;"Animals" and "Wish You Were Here" are better.  "The Wall", though, is
&gt;actually the album that got me into music.  Before I heard "The Wall"
&gt;when I was a senior in high school ('79) I listened to *only* The
&gt;Beatles.  As soon as I got "The Wall", Pink Floyd instantly toppled The
&gt;Beatles and became my favorite group.  I used to come home every day and
&gt;listen to the whole album with headphones on while poring over the
&gt;lyric sheet.

Oh come now, just you've heard Dark Side of the Moon thousands of times
doesn't mean it isn't the best Pink Floyd album!  Come on, admit it,
it is the best!  Animals and Wish you were Here are but pale imitators.
The Wall is just a two record Dark Side sans heavy synth.

&gt;Then about 3.5 years later I heard "The Dreaming"!  And Pink Floyd
&gt;tumbled like a stone.... (into the sweet morning fog?)

Will this be in the nessus autobiography entitled "My Life in the 
Bush of Floyd with the Warlus and other progressive groups"?

&gt;you have just discovered the secret message.  Please send your answers
&gt;to Old Pink, care of The Funny Farm, Chalfont."  Has anyone done this?

No, but I've revieved messages from them.  And reagan@whit-house.  And
flynt@hustler.

&gt;You know what's *really* neat?!?!  (Old time net.music readers will
&gt;already know this...)  On "The Dreaming" there is a two-way message that
&gt;is sung at the end of "Leave It Open".  When you play it forwards it
&gt;sings "We let the weirdness in".  And when you play it backwards it
&gt;sings "And they said they would not let me in"!  Not only does it say
&gt;something both forwards and backwards, but the backwards meaning is the
&gt;negation of the forward meaning!  I wish I knew how John Barrett and
&gt;Kate did this!

In a similar vein, on the new REM album check out the back and fron 
cover.  The title is either "Fables of the Reconstruction" of "Reconstruction
of the Fables". Or something like that.

&gt;I would believe them being traceable more by cologne and tobacco
&gt;than by sweat.  I think most people smell the same.

This pertains to the pull out the pin discussion.  You probably
are talking of American grunts who didn't take proper precautions.
Most of the Green Berets took pains to mask their smell or at least
smell like the nasty Viet Cong.

			A TRIBUTE TO DIRT
Larry:  Beaver, How come dirt falls apart when you pull it out of the ground?
Beaver:  I don't know.  When you put it on water, it turns to mud.
Larry:  Yeah, and when you have it in your ears, you get hollered at for it.
Beaver:  Funny stuff, all right, but I guess dirt is what holds the world 
         together.
