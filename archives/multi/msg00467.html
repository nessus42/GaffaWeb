&gt; It's on the back cover.

Oh... that helps a lot... I still think that's a KT in 'er 'ear,
though.

&gt; I dunno.  KB's real name is *very* definitely Catherine Bush, though.
&gt; ("Heathcliff, it's me... Cathy")

But how do you know for sure?  I think it's "Samantha".

&gt; &gt;&gt; [Me:] [I don't trust poets that use the word "fruition".]

Oh... "New encounters spark a true fruition."

&gt; It's some lyrics to an Aborigine song entitled "Airplane, Airplane".

Oh... I thought maybe he said "Fooled 'em again," but that
didn't sound quite right.

&gt; &gt; But, David Byrne is the "Diane" (of Sam&amp;Diane fame) of rock music!
&gt; 
&gt; Please explain further.

Well, I have often heard of David Byrne being described as
writing "intelligent lyrics," etc., just as "Diane" is often
described as "intelligent," but so far I haven't been able to
find anything very unusual about his lyrics at all.  Maybe I'm
looking at the wrong ones?  (I just saw a video of him tonight).

&gt; Blecho!  KB is *much* *much* more interesting looking.

Who are you blech-o'ing, "Melanie" or "Martha"?  If the latter,
gee, how can you say that?

&gt; (Personally, I
&gt; think she's one of the most beautiful women there are -- it's not a
&gt; beauty of physical perfection, but of radiating personality.

Uh-oh... see below:

&gt; But, I
&gt; respect her *way* to much to lust after her.  (Oh no, does this mean
&gt; that I can't respect my SO? ....))

Sounds that way to me... I wonder what Kate Bush would think...

&gt; Besides, all the yotches like the pictures that are contrived by some
&gt; banal photographer to make her look like the beautiful girl next door
&gt; (which aren't on any of her record covers except the American "Kick
&gt; Inside"), rather than the ones that bring out her interesting
&gt; personality.  Now, the cover of "Never for Ever" (both front and back
&gt; and gatefold inside) -- now *there's* a record cover!

You mean the one where she sticks out her tongue and acts like a
bat?  Well, now, I would say "Blech-O" to that one for sure! 
Not to mention the drawing on the other side.

&gt; &gt; Musicians nowadays... I guess they are all influenced by punk rock or
&gt; &gt; something.
&gt; 
&gt; What cup of wisdom would lead you to believe that....

Well, when I drive to work each morning, I see all these
children walking to school, and they are wearing strange
clothes: fluorescent orange shoes, shirts with unnatural colors
of paint spotted on them, and unnatural shapes. "Why do people
dress this way," I ask myself... and I figure it must be "punk
rock".  Well, musicians dress that way nowadays too.  What ever
happened to "earth tones", natural shapes, and so on? That is
how people dressed when *I* was young.

&gt; Well there aren't many musicians like Kate Bush!  Hey, KB has 10
&gt; O-levels....  And a four octave voice....

What's an O-level?

&gt; &gt; Also, she can read both Latin and Greek,
&gt; 
&gt; How useful!

It is if you have endless questions about etymology, like I do.

&gt; Regarding driving in Manhattan:

Don't forget "Pork and Salted Cabbage at Four Five Six at the
end of The Bowery".  The cabbage is like a Kate Bush song...
"one moment you think you are listening to the classics, and the
next it is the hard rock, the very hard rock".

&gt; 		 The night doesn't like it
&gt; 		 Looks just like a recidivist on the moon to me
