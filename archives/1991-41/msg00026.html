 &gt;A year a ago I found a Bulgarian pressing of Never for Ever from a local
 &gt;shop. I'm pretty sure it was imported from Russia. Same shop also had
 &gt;Peter Gabriel's So released under Russian Melodika label.
 &gt;So there has been at least some exposure to Kate Bush in Soviet Union before.
 
 
  Thanks Perttu, I was being a little factious with my "at least one
 comment".  A long time girlfriend of mine made a trip to the Soviet Union
 and Egypt a few years ago and while driving back from the airport she
 informed me that there a number of KaTe albums floating around within the
 'art' communities of both these countries.
 
  QUESTION:  Is there anyone around here who collects "National Geographic"?
 
  The reason I ask is this, within the pages of an _old_ issue of National
 Geographic is perhaps the most obscure KaTe reference of all time.  It
 comes in the form of a interior photograph of a peasants house (we are
 talking wood slat floors and oil burning lamps here) located (I think) in
 one of the Baltic states.  What we see in this photograph is a TKI
 crossed legged poster hanging on a wall, it's 'kinda off to the side but
 impossible to miss once you see it.  I really screwed up and did not buy
 this mag when I just happened on to it in a used book store, since then I
 have looked and looked to avail.  The best I can figure the issue was
 some where within 80 to 84.  If anyone finds it or knows about it
 _please_ let me know...

                     "I think quotes are very dangerous things!" KaTe Bush...
