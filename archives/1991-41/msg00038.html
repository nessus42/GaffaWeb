You'll have to forgive me if this is not as good as it could be.  Chalk this
whole thing up to a few hours in the middle of the night after doing layout for
the paper.  All of this is strictly in fun, and if you can't deal with that,
then that's your problem.  Flame me for not making it better, or for not being
funny enough, but not for being insulted!

********************************************************************************

The first book of KaTe commonly called The KreaTion:

In the beginning KaTe kreated the big sky and the earth. ("Hello, earth!") The
earth was without form and void, and there was no deeper understanding to be
found; and the Spirit of KaTe was moving under the ice.

And KaTe said, "Let there be music"; and there was music. And KaTe saw that the
music was good; and KaTe separated the bailaikas from the uiellian pipes. KaTe
called the music Gaffa, and the darkness she called Baghdad. And there was a
night of the swallow and there was the morning fog.

And KaTe said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the love-hounds, and 
let it separate the love from the anger." And KaTe made the firmament and 
separated the love which was under the ivy from the anger which was under the 
leaves and the trees. And it was so. And KaTe called the firmament Heaven. And
there was evening and there was morning, a second day. 

And KaTe said, "Let the seven waves under the heavens be gathered together into
one place, and let the homeground appear." And it was so. KaTe called the dry
land a "sensual world", and the waves that were gathered together she called 
snow. And KaTe saw that it was good. And KaTe said, "Let put forth musical
instruments, keyboards yielding notes, and bulgarian trios bearing background
vocals in which is their seed, each according to its kind, upon the world." And
it was so. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.

And KaTe said, "Let there be little lights shining in the firmament of the
heavens to separate the warm from the soothing; and let them be for shivers and
for quivers and for moans and sighs, and let them be reactions in the hearts of
the believers to give light upon the earth." And it was so. And KaTe made the
two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to
rule the night; she made her rare flowers also. And KaTe set them in the
firmament of the records to give light upon the earth, to rule over the mind
and the soul, and to separate the light from the darkness. And KaTe saw that it
was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.

And KaTe said, "Let the waves bring forth swarms of live tours, and let dances
pass through the air across the front of the stage." So KaTe kreated the great
musical performances and every poem that accompanies, with which the images
flew, according to their kinds, and every interpretation according to its kind.
And KaTe saw that it was good. And KaTe blessed them, saying "Be fruitful and
multiply and fill the amphitheaters in the countries, and let concerts multiply
on the earth." And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.

And KaTe said, "Let the earth bring forth videos according to their kinds:
rain-makers and dunce caps and chain mail bikinis according to their kinds."
And it was so. And KaTe made the demons of the experiments according to their
kinds and the celtic images according to their kinds, and everything that
breathes within the womb according to its kind. And KaTe saw that it was good.

Then KaTe said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them
have dominion over the terminals of the network, and over the flame wars, and
over the explanations of 'gaffa', and over the inaudible lyrics in the
background, and over every note that creeps upon the song." So KaTe kreated
love-hounds in her own image, in the image of KaTe she kreated them; lurker and
regular she kreated them. And KaTe blessed them, and KaTe said to them, "Be
fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over
the newsgroups." And KaTe said, "Behold, I have given you every song yielding
beauty which is upon the face of all the earth, and every video with seed in
its fruit." And it was so. And KaTe saw everything that she had made, and
behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth
day.

Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on
the seventh day KaTe finished her work which she had done, and she rested for
four years from all her work which she had done. So KaTe blessed the long waits
and hallowed it, because on it KaTe rested from all her work which she had done
in kreation.
