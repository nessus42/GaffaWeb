Hi!

Apologies if I've posted this before, as I may or may not have hallucinated
doing...

The first time I heard Kate, I stumbled upon the video for "Sat In Your Lap"
late one night on MTV when I was in junior-high.  I didn't stick around long
enough to see who the perpretrator of roller-skating with Klansmen was, and
had nightmares for a week.  I didn't realize it was Kate until I rented the
TWS videos 7 years later.

My first "real" exposure to Kate was the TWS version of "Wuthering Heights"
when it came out, on the radio.  I thought Wow, what a neat voice, but that
was that until I found out the guy I'd had a mad crush on since 4th-grade
was totally in love with Kate and considered her his goddess (still does,
as a matter of fact! :).  I figured, If it's good enough for him it's good
enough for me, and bought TWS at the first opportunity.

And the rest is history. :)

(Incidentally, SIYL is one of my all-time favorites from Kate- imagine how
I freaked out when I discovered which video that was! :)



My first "real" exposure to Kate was the TWS version of "Wuthering Heights"
on the radio when it came out- I probably heard RUTH too, but I don't remember.
