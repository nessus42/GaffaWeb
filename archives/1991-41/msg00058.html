<PRE>

Fairly long ago (July, maybe?) someone posted that they had just gotten
a copy of the Residents' latest, _Freak Show_.  One of the reasons that
post was made to Love-Hounds in the first place was that the poster 
(someone who posted from Georgetown or George Washington University and
whose name I don't recall) thought that the female vocalist singing on
the 2nd track, "Herman the Head," sounded incredibly like KaTe--and,
with the Residents' history of famous, uncredited guest singers (such
as Andy Patridge on _The Commercial Album_), it wasn't as unlikely as it
might seem for it to actually _be_ KaTe singing on this track.

Some of you may recall my several angry posts about the quality of record
stores in the DC area--I had been looking for _Freak Show_ since April
when I first heard of its existence, and still hadn't found it.

Well, Tower *finally* got in 3 (!) copies of it this past week, much to 
my amazement and joy (though it wasn't quite as exciting as finding a copy
of Fish's new album this morning).

In any event...to my ear, the female vocalist in question on _Freak Show_
sounds *nothing* like KaTe.  It is, however, a brilliant album if you're into 
this sort of thing...
