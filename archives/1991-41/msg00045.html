This is the latest version of the Renaissance US Discography which
I originally compiled in 1982.  I believe this to be up-to-date as
of the beginning of May, 1991.

Many (if not all) of the band's Sire recordings have just been
reissued on CD in Japan.  I am currently trying to verify titles and
catalog numbers, so there will be an update in the near future.

(If anyone in netland has the Japanese reissues,
your indulgence in this matter would be greatly appreciated :-).
