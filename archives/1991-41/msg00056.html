what's with you guys, spending all day dancing round kate's throne of light?
kate's music is good toe-tapping stuff, but if you want something with REAL
spiritual substance, why don't you try listening to the cocteau twins?

incidentally thankyou to whoever mentioned the marine girls' double CD.
i used to listen to them a lot years ago until all my tapes got stolen.
as soon as i heard about the CD i dashed out and bought it. i love their
simple and naive style, which i like to think was inspired by mo tucker's
"after hours" on the velvet underground's third album.

the marine girls were three sisters, and one of them grew up to be tracy thorn
of everything but the girl. the marine girls and ben watt (the other half of 
EBTG and, despite his socialist posturing, the recipient of a privileged 
upbringing) were all on cherry red records in the UK and all feature on their
excellent sampler "pillows and prayers". tracy broke up the band to spend more
time studying. she and ben graduated from hull university (tracy got a first in 
english), and then lived happily ever after as everything but the girl. the 
last i heard of the other two sisters was that they continued making marine
girls style music as "grab grab the haddock" but i've never heard or seen
any of their records. if anybody knows any more, i'd love to hear about it.

cheers my dears
jane
