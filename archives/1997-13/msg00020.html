You've got me pegged!

&gt; 
&gt; I would guess that some people on the list are afraid to express an
&gt; unpopular opinion.

During the history of Love-Hounds, there have been plenty of people
aboard who would've called it sh*t if that's how they felt.  Goodness
knows just about everything else she's produced has had a critic
around here.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Yet it is long-standing doctrine in this group.
&gt; 
&gt; Okay. You string the videos for "HoL," "Cloudbusting," "The Big Sky" and
&gt; "RUTH" together and tell me that there's a thematic quality. If you can
&gt; make that stretch, you must be the Rubberband Guy. They're just five songs
&gt; that didn't fit into "TNW" fiasco.

Oh, the videos.  I've never seen "HoL" or "Cloudbusting" (or "Exp IV"--I'd
love to buy a copy of "The Whole Story" video in NTSC).  I was talking from
a purely musical perspective.


&gt; Quick, completely true story: My wife comes home one day. She says, "I
&gt; heard this song on the radio. I think it was Kate Bush, but it wasn't very
&gt; good. Does she do a song called 'Cornflake Girl'?"

When that song first came out, I *repeatedly* reacted with "They're playing
'The Red Shoes' on the radio?!'".  I think TA intentionally put that on the
front to piss off Kate's fans. :)

Fare thee well.
