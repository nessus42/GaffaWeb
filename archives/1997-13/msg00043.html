Sorry, only a little whinge, but can we keep sexist crap off lovehounds?
 I like being a member of lovehounds and like the people - but I don't
like the nasty taste that some recent messages have left.
Yeah, I know, that sounds dead pious.
-------

yes it does, especially when you leave it deliberately vague what 
exactly it was that you found so offensive. if you are talking about the 
weight comments, get over it, the people referring to kate's weight were 
ironically referring to a longstanding discussion thread that invariably 
pisses people off--they weren't advocating discussion of kate's weight, 
they were joking about people's preoccupation with it.

of course, it could have been some completely different thread which you 
found "sexist." in which case you should say directly what it is that 
bothers you so interested parties can directly engage you in 
conversation about the topic, or you should privately email the 
party(ies) responsible and air your views.

whinge is right!

AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT--I love all the debate about TNW, but c'mon, it's 
hardly fair to say that love-hounds have been unanimous in their love of 
this composition in the past. Believe it or not, once upon a time (ok, i 
was only 17 so I can be excused), I HATED The Dreaming (the album). 
that's what's so great about an artist with such a varied body of work - 
something for everyone. IMHO, of course
