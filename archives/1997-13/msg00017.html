Hello, all!

First off--Don, please don't mistake my incredulousness for disrespect.

"In essentials, Unity.
 In non-essentials, Liberty.
 In all things, Love."

I would like to state my allegiance to the obvious:
Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, no matter how silly
they are.  I have mine...

Even more so in Love-Hounds!

&gt; I went back and listened to it yet again after posting...just to make sure.
&gt; And, yes, I can say quite confidently that I find "The Ninth Wave" to be
&gt; the biggest load of pretentious nonsense since "Tales of Topographic
&gt; Oceans" by Yes. I feel like someone is forcing me to listen to the audio
&gt; portion of a bad art movie without at least letting me be distracted by the
&gt; visuals. Obtuse dialogue and obscure production may impress the
&gt; impressionable, but I find it to be hopelessly self-indulgent.

I don't know what's going on here, but at least you're consistent.
You don't like what I consider the masterpieces of my favorite female
artist and group!

&gt; Contrast this with the wonderfully well-realized combination of songwriting
&gt; craft, production and performance in the five songs in "Hounds of Love"
&gt; sequence.

The worst problem with the HoL side is that, on an admittedly outstanding
day, more than one of today's "popular" artists could have produced similar
work.

TNW, however, is uniquely a product of the gift of genius that is Kate.

&gt; &gt; It pretty effectively encapsulates _everything_ I like about KB's
&gt; &gt;music - it's simply a beautifully, beautifully realized work of art.
    (Amen!)
&gt; 
&gt; Okay. I think TNW allows KB's worst tendencies for pretension run wild for
&gt; far too long.

Have you watched _The_Line,_the_Cross_and_the_Curve_?  (Now there *I*
go! At least you won't be hanging alone.)

&gt; &gt; I would cautiously
&gt; &gt;propose that it is one of those things that transcends such oppositions as
&gt; &gt;good/bad;  i.e. you may not _like_ it, but you still recognize its merit,
&gt; &gt;correct?
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, but I don't recognize its merit. I think TNW is something we're
&gt; supposed to be kind about, right?

No.
This group uniformly (until now :) recognizes the genius of TNW.
(Actually, since I don't know how you feel about using smileys,
I would guess you are joking here.)

&gt; &gt; just wondering - I hate to just _assume_ that you are a pod
&gt; &gt;person!
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, I'm a singles person. I think KB's best work is when she makes
&gt; herself accessible in the more structured environment than the
&gt; less-disciplined album setting.

One more thing... How did you like Pink Floyd's _The_Wall_?

And then...

&gt; It would most likely be an unsuccessful argument, however.

Yet it is long-standing doctrine in this group.


Let me close by saying I don't see how someone can consider Kate a
uniquely gifted artist (and I haven't seen Don make that claim) and
not appreciate TNW.

But then, I like much a what Tori Amos has done, until BfP.
