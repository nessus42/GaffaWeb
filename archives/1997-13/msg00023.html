Hi, all. I'm selling my entire KB vinyl collection, built up over a decade
of rummaging through rare record stores and conventions. It will be sold
in its entirety only--no piecing it out.

All are in their original sleeves/jackets and most have been played only
once while dubbed to cassette.

WARNING: this is for serious collectors only. Casual listeners most likely
cannot afford the collection and they would probably be disheartened by
the quality of the bootlegs anyway.

U.S. $350 firm for the whole lot. I tried to include as much info as I
could, but if you need more info on a specific piece, feel free to mail me
(note nospam in address).

The list is pretty long, so without further ado:
