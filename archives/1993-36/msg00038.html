A few random (really deep) thoughts:

o  Ren &amp; Stimpy Eat The Music - I love it!  I'm jealous (that I didn't
think of it first).
o  IED (The ONLY one on Gaffa who's a better KateFan(tm) than I) and his
idea of what to do with the Utterly Pedestrian Mix of Hounds of Love
(in case you forgot, he suggested playing it, slightly out of synch, with
the album version at the same time).

Which gave me another idea:  What to do with those "lesser" Katesongs:
Mix them with an appropriate better Katesong (or mix them together)
for very pleasing results.  For best results, place speakers of both
stereos diagnally apart so one doesn't drown out the other.
Here are some appropriate mixes:

SONG 1              SONG 2
Rocket Man          In Search of Peter Pan
The Warm Room       Get Out of My House
Reaching Out        Mother Stands for Comfort
Fullhouse           The Empty Bullring
The Fog             The Morning Fog
Symphony In Blue    Violin

(Funny how most of the "Lesser songs" come from Lionheart)

o  OK, you British Lovehounds, I want all of you to buy 25 copies of
"Rubberband Girl" RIGHT NOW.  And get all your friends, family,
co-workers, and every random person you meet on the street to do so,
too.  I want to see that song at #1!

o  I *HOPE* the album doesn't come out 'til January.  That way, the
Kate Equation will live and there will be consistancy in our lives.

o  "Split the Banana/Crush the Sultana" are Kate's most painful lyrics
to date.  I find myself cringing, reaching for my crotch whenever they
sing those lines.  (As opposed to "The Sensual World"'s, "Mmmm, yes!",
where I reach for my crotch for an entirely different purpose).

o  While I'm at it, all of us American Lovehounds should all buy 25
copies of Eat The Music....Naah, it's not worth it.

o  Bay Area Lovehounds - The Stanford Theatre will be showing "The Red
Shoes" (the 30's version) in a couple of weeks.  Watch this space or
write me for more info.

o  Watch the night skies!

o  I did NOT find the KT symbol on my copy of EtM yet, but I *DID* 
find Waldo.

o  She is!  She really is!

o  WOMAD in San Francisco was great!  The best part was that I DIDN'T
run into Drukman!

- Stev0 the Split

"Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!"
- Peter Gabriel at WOMAD
