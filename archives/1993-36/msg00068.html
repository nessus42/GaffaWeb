&gt; fester. One of the things that has made KaTe special to me is the 
&gt; intimacy of so mmany of her songs. Her songs make you _feel_ and become 
&gt; involved, rather than just something to play as background music.

I agree.
 
&gt; The fact that EtM didn't do any of this, did not make me joyful as some 
&gt; of her other playful music has done, and did not make me feel anything 
&gt; but disappointment, is what is wrong with the song. Perhaps the song just 
&gt; doesn't relate much to my life, or I just don't get it, but it is too 
&gt; repetitious for my taste. If writing this song made KaTe happy, then it 
&gt; has served its entire purpose. Whether we like it on love-hounds does not 
&gt; matter, since she is one of the few artists writing music for herself 
&gt; rather than to make money. I respect this in KaTe, and love her for it.

It *really* moved me, literally.  After a shitty day I finally heard
EtM for the first time and it helped me forget my numerous problems
and made me move and dance.  This has not happened in a long long
time and I thank Kate for it.  I hope she had fun making it, it sure
sounds like she did.  :)

I agree it is repetitious, which is usually something I hate, but I have
no trouble listening to the two versions back-to-back.  However, I do
think it was a bad idea to put them next to each other anyway.

&gt; For the record, count me as one of the folks who absolutely adores the song
&gt; (I like it and RBG more than BSL).  Lyrically it's wonderful, and the music
&gt; is incredibly infectious--the most danceable KaTesong since "The Big Sky."
&gt; Nothing since then has made me want, nay need to move the way ETM does.
&gt; It's glorious.  So's the remix.  Rubberband Girl is loads of fun but the

My sentiments almost exactly.  I haven't heard RBG yet.
