&gt; &gt;I haven't really seen him mistreat many *musical* guests, however.  In fact
&gt; &gt;he has always seemed to treat them with something approaching awe.  It may
&gt; &gt;be just me, because after one of my favorite artists on he always seems to
&gt; &gt;spend several minutes going on about how great their music is.  And 
&gt; &gt;Michelle Shocked (not known for being exactly an anti-feminist) seems to
&gt; &gt;have a pretty good relationship with him (even sending him a handwritten
&gt; &gt;copy of the lyrics to "anchorage" when she found out how much he liked the
&gt; &gt;song.)

&gt;    Maybe, but he does seem to prefer women willing to adopt a "ditzy"
&gt; personia. Teri Garr is actually a very intelligent and thoughtful person
&gt; though you couldn't tell it from the she is manipulated into behaving
&gt; on Letterman's show. Cher didn't give him *half* of what he deserved.

I think Teri Garr is playing... I mean she is on often (why does she
keep coming back?) and her reactions and actions are melodramatic.
I don't think she is being manipulated into it, I think she plays
with it.  I do think Letterman is overly rude to some people at times
though.

Concerning musical guests, I agree that he seems to treat them
with respect.  Even Screaming Trees and Shakespear's Sister (listening
to now), with all of one members weird make-up, got respect, even
though there were a couple jokes about glitter.  He also said he felt
like a geek when he went out to thank them and they all started
dancing and he was just standing there.
