<PRE>
I have seven 40" X 60" British subway posters for "Rubberband Girl" for 
sale or trade (I'd especially love a copy of the Aspel/Rocket Man/etc. 
tape).  I am asking only that I make back what I paid for them, which 
is $7.50 each ($6 each for the poster, $1.50 per that I paid for postage 
to me).  That is to say that I do not intend to make any profit from 
this, other than spreading Kateness across the Bay Area--and I kept my
invoice, in case someone doubts me.  I figured there were enough Bay 
Area people on gaffa that I wouldn't have trouble finding people who 
would want them, so I ordered extras.  I make them available strictly 
on a first-come-first-served basis.

One little snag, though:  I cannot afford the time and immense trouble
necessary to ship these huge packages out, and I don't have a car.  So, 
if you want one, you have to get it from me in person somehow--either 
at my house (near Dolores Park) or at some pre-arranged meeting place 
in San Francisco and convenient to MUNI.

If you haven't seen the poster, it's the same picture that's on the
single cover, but with less empty space to Kate's sides.  There is a
12" tall stripe across the bottom which is the top portion of the photo
on the reverse of the CD-single sleeve (this picture cuts off around
Kate's eyes).  In the center of this stripe is a square inset of the
photo from the CD itself, which is the same as the inset photo on the
reverse of the CD sleeve.  The legend, "Kate Bush    Rubberband Girl"
appears curved around Kate, just as on the single sleeve, with the 
addition of the words, "OUT NOW!" printed underneath Kate.

If you haven't seen this single, the photo is of Kate, barefoot and leaping 
in the air in what could be either a dance move or a martial arts flying 
attack.  (Judging from the expression on her face, I'd almost opt for the 
latter... :-)   This is not a glamour shot by any stretch of the 
imagination.  It is much more an action shot.

So, if you're interested in one of these extremely good bargains and can
come to my house to get it, call me at (415) 552-1289 (home) or 
(415) 781-6777 (work) to make arrangements.  Call today!  Answering
machines are standing by!
