In article &lt;m0oe83g-000ilhC@fciad2.bsd.uchicago.edu&gt;, chrisw@fciad2.bsd.uchicago.edu (chris williams) writes:
&gt; &gt;&gt;   Kate was scheduled to appear on Letterman when she was in New York
&gt; &gt;&gt;promoting _Hounds of Love_. We suspect that she canceled the gig after
&gt; &gt;&gt;seeing his notorious mistreatment of his female guests. I hope she
&gt; &gt;&gt;appears on every talk show *but* his.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well, maybe.  But if it is out of principle (disgust at his leering at some
&gt; &gt;of his female guests, which I agree he does although not as egregiously as
&gt; &gt;he used to) I would doubt she would appear on SNL either.  It's not exactly
&gt; &gt;Gloria Steinem heaven.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;I haven't really seen him mistreat many *musical* guests, however.  In fact
&gt; &gt;he has always seemed to treat them with something approaching awe.  It may
&gt; &gt;be just me, because after one of my favorite artists on he always seems to
&gt; &gt;spend several minutes going on about how great their music is.  And 
&gt; &gt;Michelle Shocked (not known for being exactly an anti-feminist) seems to
&gt; &gt;have a pretty good relationship with him (even sending him a handwritten
&gt; &gt;copy of the lyrics to "anchorage" when she found out how much he liked the
&gt; &gt;song.)
&gt; 
&gt;    Maybe, but he does seem to prefer women willing to adopt a "ditzy"
&gt; personia. Teri Garr is actually a very intelligent and thoughtful person
&gt; though you couldn't tell it from the she is manipulated into behaving
&gt; on Letterman's show. Cher didn't give him *half* of what he deserved.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;                           Chris Williams of
&gt;                              Chris'n'Vickie of Chicago
&gt;                                chrisw@fciad2.bsd.uchicago.edu (his)
&gt;                                  vickie@njin.rutgers.edu      (hers)
&gt;                                    katefans@chinet.chinet.com (ours)

I think one overgeneralizes when saying that Letterman mistreats only female
guests.  He mistreats male guests, too.  Some guests he doesn't mistreat, but
instead worships.

Particular female guests he treats particularly well are Phoebe Cates, Carol
Kane, Ellen Barkin, and (of course) "our good friend" Meg from across the
street (from his old studio).

Regards,
Andy
