<PRE>
A previous posting of mine received a lot of bashing (the description of 
why Del is not credited on EtM, and why EtM is so repetitive). A response 
is long overdue, so here it is:

My intention was not to hurt KaTe during her time of pain, or to make a 
nasty comment about their relationship. What I posted was meant in a 
humorous way, and I didn't expect people to take it so seriously. This 
was a _joke_, folks! It is a fact that I have never cared for Del's 
abilities in the studio - that I cannot deny. But their relationship is a 
separate entity, one which none of us has a right to comment on unless we 
know them both personally. If I made any suggestion as to their 
relationship, rather than to Del's ability in the studio, then I am truly 
sorry.

As I mentioned in a different post, I may be writing negative things 
about EtM, but I still think it is better than 90% of the stuff out 
there. It just isn't up to par when you look at KaTe's other music. This 
does not mean that KaTe is on a downhill course. I cannot listen to 
'Moments of pleasure' without crying, because it captures the sense of 
loss that I know KaTe feels over her mother, and that I have felt not 
that long ago with the loss of my father. My heart has gone out to KaTe 
over her losses of the past year, and I am glad to see that she is 
turning to something which has given her comfort for so many years to 
express those feelings, rather than keeping them inside and letting them 
fester. One of the things that has made KaTe special to me is the 
intimacy of so mmany of her songs. Her songs make you _feel_ and become 
involved, rather than just something to play as background music.

The fact that EtM didn't do any of this, did not make me joyful as some 
of her other playful music has done, and did not make me feel anything 
but disappointment, is what is wrong with the song. Perhaps the song just 
doesn't relate much to my life, or I just don't get it, but it is too 
repetitious for my taste. If writing this song made KaTe happy, then it 
has served its entire purpose. Whether we like it on love-hounds does not 
matter, since she is one of the few artists writing music for herself 
rather than to make money. I respect this in KaTe, and love her for it.
