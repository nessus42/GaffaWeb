Hi there from Paris,
I saw Tori 2 years ago and the show has been very poor.
many people leaved the theatre before the end (me too).
Yes,she's beautifull but her music is weak compared to KB.
Have a nice day and enjoy the Muzik.

Jean.

&gt; &gt;As most Kate Bush fanatics (read: me) would assert, Tori (not 
&gt; &gt;counting her Y Kant Tori Read phase) first come out as a direct 
&gt; &gt;rip-off of Kate.  Her _Little Earthquakes_ album not only was 
&gt; &gt;an attempt to pass her off as a Kate clone, but even down to 
&gt; &gt;the album design, it was a horrible way to market Tori, and it 
&gt; &gt;was that that turned me immediately off to her after I bought the
&gt; &gt;album in anticipation of hearing someone who supposedly approached
&gt; &gt;the "true genious" of Kate Bush.  I had hoped at the time that I 
&gt; &gt;would discover another true musical "katelike" artist such as 
&gt; &gt;Happy Rhodes, who I had been thankful to discover (thanks Vickie!)
 
&gt; &gt;It was not to be, for me. 
&gt; 
&gt; "An attempt to pass her off as a Kate clone"? Well excuse me, but I
think
&gt; I've missed something here.It's true that when I read a review of
"Little
&gt; Earthquakes" in early 1992,  Tori was compared to the likes of a.o.
Kate
&gt; Bush, but that was also the way I got to listen to Beverley Craven,
Sam
&gt; Brown and Mylene Farmer, to name but a few.
&gt; Upon listening to the album I saw every comparison fade away -
except for
&gt; the fact that, simply said, they both play the piano and they both
are female.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; &gt;&gt; I know Joni is one of Tori's favorite artists, but 
&gt; &gt;&gt; does anyone know how joni feels about tori??  A lot of
entertainment 
&gt; &gt;&gt; magazines have made comments like tori is joni on crack, i
wonder if 
&gt; &gt;&gt; joni agrees!?
&gt; &gt;&gt; :)
&gt; &gt;&gt; jordan
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I've never heard or read of Tori being compared to Joni, but over
and
&gt; &gt;over again the comparisons are made between Tori and Kate.  And
that 
&gt; &gt;is a bogus comparison: Tori only "sounds" like Kate: her music is 
&gt; &gt;nowhere near the quality of Kate's or Joni's, but at the same
time, I
&gt; &gt;must reiterate that I respect Tori nonetheless for her hard work. 
&gt; 
&gt; Wrong on many counts here. Yes, Tori was compared to Joni numerous
times,
&gt; but only during the year 1994, when Tori released "Under the pink"
and
&gt; recorded a (very well-made, BTW) cover of "A case of you".
&gt; The fact that the Kate-Tori comparison keeps popping up is probably
a case
&gt; of bad journalism: in the beginning, it has been written several
times and
&gt; these articles are always read before another journalist starts
doing an
&gt; interview. 
&gt; I can't speak for other countries, but I've not heard the
comparison in the
&gt; Dutch press anymore for two to three years now. I won't tell you
Dutch
&gt; press is better than the press in other countries
but...............
&gt; Tori does not sound like Kate at all. If you'd listen to her music,
and if
&gt; you wish, "eat" it, you will notice a vague echo of a more
cabaretest Kate
&gt; (see "Coffee Homeground")  in Tori's "The wrong band", recorded in
1993.
&gt; Otherwise, there is no similarity. Okay, they both have a female
voice,
&gt; I'll grant you that. But it's ridiculous to call that "sounding
like"
&gt; someone. 
&gt; And finally: Tori's music is nowhere near the quality of Kate's and
Joni's?
&gt;  I can't speak about Joni, because I don't know much about her
music, but
&gt; it is true that Tori's music is nowhere near the quality of Kate's.
Simply
&gt; because Tori is _better_. As much as I hate to say this, but I
don't think
&gt; Kate would be capable of doing the following:
&gt; - Recording a track in one take, and still sounding like an
intricate web
&gt; of beautiful melodies. ("Thoughts", "Not the red baron")
&gt; - Hearing a song one time and doing a cover of it on the spot
("lovesong",
&gt; originally by the Cure)
&gt; - Taking a song, even one as ghastly as "Smells like teen spirit"
and
&gt; making it your very own with the aid of just one piano and your
voice.
&gt; 
&gt; Kate is a good musician in her own right, but through the years
I've
&gt; discovered that there are better ones, who can perform without all
the aid
&gt; of knobs and faders she seems to need. I hope you will open your
eyes and
&gt; ears someday as well.
&gt; 
&gt; And to the people who are reading this with disgust: yes, I _am_ a
KateFan.
&gt; But I do not wish to treat her as  infallible. Nor do I see Tori as
such:
&gt; her last album contained too much manierism. 
&gt; But if you face facts, you'll probably come to the same
conclusions. 
&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; 
&gt;
