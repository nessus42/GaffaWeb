Hi All,

I'm relatively new to the list, have been subscribed for about three
months, but haven't really had much to say. It's always great to see
others on the list has to say because it gets me that much more
interested in the performer, more informed, or educated when I didn't
have the time to research - or money for the zines :(.

Well, a while back, someone had posted their top five favorite songs by
K.B. and I was glad to see what had come about. I myself couldn't put
together quite the comprehensive list as some of you had, due to the
fact that I only have three of these magnificent pieces o' work that we
all comment about. But if I had to narrow it down, my favorites, for now
come off of the "The Sensual World" album. That's mainly due to the fact
that it is my first experience with Kate, and my, what an experience.
#;)

I then shifted myself to some research on some of her earlier music. I
had found out four years ago, that Pat Benatar (another of my faves) had
a covered of a Kate tune. That's when I decided that I had to hear the
original.  WOW!!!  was my response, what an experience. She was great
then, and hasn't seemed to lose her maturity since.

I haven't bought any other albums other the three I have right now, can
assist me in my purchasing probs? btw, the three I have: TSW, The Kick
Inside and The Red Shoes. I have seen some others out, but was hesitant
(or fell toward my current listening taste.)
