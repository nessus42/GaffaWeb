I was talking to a certain someone at Paisley Park records a long time
ago and asked about teh recording of "why should I love you" by Prince and
Kate Bush.  Prince had been a long time admirer of Kate's Hound's of love 
lp and the two became friendly.  Kate went to a private party hosted by 
Prince in London in 1992 during a tour stop. The story goes, Kate sent
Prince a tape of "why should I love YOu'   It was very bare.  Prince added
bass parts, differnt drum parts, and many different vocals as well as 
some synth.   there was also a very wild guitar solo.  Basically the song
became Prince's song.  Kate was not pleased with his additions and so he
scaled it down some.  Supposedly it still sounded too much like a Prince
production and so Kate ended up changing it even more.  The result was
then released as it is on the REd Shoes disc.  According to the source,
Prince's version was a lot faster and very chaotic.  

When i first heard the song I thought it sounded very much like a Prince
song, so Kate's resistance to it sounding too much like Prince was futile.
Prince has never been one that ever was good at bringing out anythingnew
in artists he's collaborated with.  He usually tramples right over them.
If you've ever heard the song he recorded with Madonna "love song' you can
tell that it sounds like a Prince song in the middle of  her album
He steals the show with his beautiful vocal splashes.  Her vocal parts are 
just muffled bits.  I think this is why many established artists have 
chosen not to record Prince songs, songs that he has offered tehm.
Joni Mithcell, Anita Baker, Vanessa Williams to name a few have all
rejected Prince material.  Perhaps this is why BonJOvi also never released 
any Prince material 

I was surprised to hear Prince and Kate work together on "my computer".
You can barely hear her but her voice is so distinct that you don't need
it
   any louder
