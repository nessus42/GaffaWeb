&gt;Anyone going to WOMAD this year? Not specifically a Kate event,  but
&gt;would be great to meet up with some other Kate fans there. If you don't
&gt;know WOMAD, it stand for World of Music Arts and Dance - usually there
&gt;are three stages with bands/singers/performers from all over the world
&gt;(mostly not standard rock/pop, more a focus on traditional music forms
&gt;from diffent cultures) . Free camping on fields alongside the Thames is
&gt;thrown in, along with hundreds of craft stalls and some of the best food
&gt;money can buy (not forgetting the beer tents). Peter Gabriel was
&gt;involved with setting up the festival, although he doesn't usually
&gt;perform these days as it would divert attention from the other
&gt;performers.

And let us not forget the Bush family connection to WOMAD.  In 1982, the
organization released a benefit double-album set called "Music And Rhythm"
which served as a fund-raising vehicle for the very first WOMAD Festival.
Lots of great music on this collection, including unavailable-anywhere-else
performances by Pete Townshend and and Peter Gabriel -- both of whom have
of course worked with Kate -- and a track called "Marrakesh" composed by a
fellow named Morris Pert, a name which should also ring a few bells for
Love-Hounds.  But the most relevant is a Balinese number recorded by Vic
Coppersmith-Heaven called "Pengosekan" which features Preston Heyman on
percussion and Gamelan, and none other than Paddy Bush  on Gengong.
Finding this album was the first time I'd ever seen a member of the Bush
family credited on a record by someone other than Kate, and in spite of all
the other wonderful music it includes, that's the main thing I associate
with this record.

For people without a vinyl- playing turntable, I don't think the full
collection was ever released on CD -- though I would be VERY happy to learn
I am mistaken about this! -- but a single-disc "Best Of Music And Rhythm"
was released a while back.  It includes the Gabriel, Townshend, and Pert
tracks -- as well as songs by XTC, Mighty Sparrow, David Byrne, and many
other commercially desirable artists -- but sadly NOT the Vic
Coppersmith-Heaven track.
