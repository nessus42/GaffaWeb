Vickie sez:
&gt; Live At Hammersmith Odeon is being re-released by EMI Video.

funny you should bring this up. two days ago, i found a copy of the
video in a store for $20. it was in the official emi uk case, but the
tape was obviously bootlegged (it had some nonsense about "merry som-
thing-or-other productions" on it). or so i thought at the time. may-
be this is some kind of pre-release copy of the american re-release?

oh - i didn't buy it. maybe i should have. we'll see.

&gt; This is really for real! I have a copy of the info sheet
&gt; sent to record and video stores. I have no idea why EMI Video
&gt; decided to re-release it but I wonder if it has something to
&gt; do with the.....tour? 
 
i would think that it's more a case of cashing in on KaTe's new fame
in america. a bit late perhaps - i would have thought such a release 
more likely last winter, but emi has always been slow. perhaps it's
a way of saying "sorry" to the american purchasors of the box set? or
maybe you are right and it's a preparatory move for an upcoming tour.

last night, i was listeneing to the cathy demos and was struck by an
interesting thought: wouldn't it be neat for KaTe to use some of those
songs for an upcoming album *if* it indeed turns out to be more acoustic
and simple as some have postulated? i would *kill* for a cleaned up
track of "frightened eyes" with her developed voice.
