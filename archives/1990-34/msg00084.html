Vickie here.

There's a GREAT article in the current issue of OPTION magazine
about Victoria Williams. Buy it, then write them a thank you
note for having such great taste (though she really should have
been on the cover!) She might be doing a solo tour soon. Keep an
eye out.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I had a wonderful suprise before Christmas. I received home-made
Christmas cards from Victoria and from Happy Rhodes. Happy
says that her new album is finished and is ready to be mixed.
She's worked so long and so hard on this album, paying for it
as she went along (just like Jane's first album--Work/save money/record
a song. Work/save money/record a song.)

Hopefully they'll have enough money to finish it in the next couple
of months. They've also been saving money to be able to press CDs.
Her other 4 albums are only available on cassette. Those will probably
be unavailable soon, by the way. Since now she dubs each one in real
time as she gets orders in, the time will come when she won't have the
time to do that anymore. They'll never be picked up and released by a
record label so these are truly magnificent collector's items.
Not to mention that the music is WONDERFUL!!!
Please, those of you who have already bought them, please please
back me up on this. Let Love-Hounds hear it from other Love-Hounds
besides me. For those who are interested, the address to write to get
her first four is:

Aural Gratification
P.O. Box 8658
Academy Station
Albany, NY  12208

Albums to date:

Rhodes Vol. I
Rhodes Vol. II
Rearmament
Ecto

They're **ALL** worth getting, but if you can only afford one or two at a
time, I'd suggest Vol. I and/or Ecto. If you get any of them, keep in
mind that she was all alone in the studio shen she recorded them so
EVERYTHING (voices, instruments, synths) is pure 100% Happy. She's
an amazing lady! I'm terrible at describing music and I won't try.
It's especially hard with Happy because her music is so simple yet so
original. She doesn't fit into any category. She's not folk, rock, pop,
country, or anything else. She's just......well.....Happy! Her lyrics
can be dark, forbidding, uplifting, interesting, bizarre, and are
always just plain wonderful. 
You certainly get your money's worth because on these albums is a 
total of 63 songs!

Please support a brilliant struggling artist. You'll be pleased.
I promise! Besides, she's a Kate Bush fan (SHE should have sang at
the convention--would have blown everyone away! I sent a copy of
Ecto to Kate last week and suggested that she hire Happy as a back-up
singer for the tour!) and a Peter Gabriel fan and a Bach fan! How can you
not support someone with such GREAT taste in music?

To Deb:
Sorry I've been such a bum! I'll get it back to you soon.
----------------------------------------------------------------

To Gregory, Stephen and woj:

You guys are SO cool! Thank you!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

To Gregory:

Please put me on that list to receive your booklet. I can't wait!

------------------------------------------------------------------

To Susan:

Glad to have you back!!!!!! Good luck on your job interview.
Here's our address:

Vickie Mapes
Chris Williams
1627 W. Farwell, #2N
Chicago, IL 60626
(312) 274-1921

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everyone should buy Red Hot &amp; Blue. It's a worthy cause and the music
is great too. Especially Kirsty MacColl &amp; The Pogues. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASTER AWEKE IS COMING IN CONCERT TO CHICAGO!!! WATCH FOR HER IN YOUR CITY!!

Cheerios,
