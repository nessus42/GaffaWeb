Well, I just returned from my sojourn to the Great White North (where I 
was born) and while I was there I was able to purchase the box set for
a mere $125C (+ tax ==&gt; ~$136C).  This was the lowest price I could find.
I got it at Dutchy's, but the price I was quoted was from some other CD
store, which I never got to.  When I went to Dutchy's (it was the
first store I happened to visit) they were selling it for $139, but
they gave it to me for 125 when I said the other store was selling it for
that.  So I just took it.  Everywhere else I went I saw it for 139 or
higher (I never made it to the store I originally called, which probably
is unfortunate, but I was with a friend and we didn't want to spend all
day in record stores...).  I haven't seen the CD box set offered for less
than around $175US in the Chicago area, but even if it were, I can't 
imagine it would be for less than 125 Canadian, which, at an exchange rate of
about .86, translates to about 107.50 US.  This is a far cry from the
$80 Vancouver price, but it is still quite good.

As far as my box set impressions (now that I do own it, although I haven't
listened to it yet) I cannot but the sentiments of others over the lack
of sophisticated presentation.  I knew exactly what to expect (from 
discussions on LH) so I was not disappointed.  It would have been nice
to see the photos in a larger format; it would have been nice to get lyrics
to the b-sides; it would have been nice to see a bio.  

However, for someone who never owned the UK versions of the albums (though
I have all the domestic cheapo CDs), it is very nice to own the originals.

Further, I guess there is something (not much, but something) to be said
for the simplicity of the package... the stark lack of ornate packaging
and contents does serve to bring the music into focus... and as we all
know, the truth is that it is the music that brings us together.
If anything, that is one point that has meaning here.  All that icing
would certainly have been great, but no matter what, Kate Bush's music
stands in its own class, and it truly needs no embellishment.

Happy holidays, folks!
