&gt; &gt;Could someone please post or E-mail the little poem in "Jig of Life"?
&gt;
&gt;  &lt;most of poem deleted&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; We are the going water and the gone
&gt; We are of water and the holy land of water
&gt; And all that's to come runs in 
&gt; With the thrust on the strand.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody know if KaTe wrote this part herself or if John Carder not only
&gt; recited, but also wrote it?
&gt; 
&gt; Jeff
&gt; 
 
At least the last paragraph is derived from an anonymous Irish folk
song/poem.  I'll post it as soon as I remember to bring my Bartlett's
to work.  Vaguely, it's "Ich am of Irelonde and the Holy Lande of
Irelonde".
