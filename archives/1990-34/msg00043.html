Really-From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward Suranyi)
 
 
The _Billboard_ year-end issue (dated Dec. 22) just came out.  This
covers the music year from November 1989 to November 1990.  Kate
is mentioned several times.
 
First, Columbia has a two-page spread crowing about their success over
the year.  (They have a right to be proud; _Billboard_ says they were
the top pop label, with 60 charted albums.  That's almost double
the second place label, Atlantic.)  The ad says:
 
Years like this don't just happen.  They're built *one* success at a time.
Thanks to our artists for a year of wall to wall success.
 
About two dozen of their most successful albums are posted on a wall.
Yes, _The Sensual World_ is one of them!
 
Second, EMI Music Publishing also has a large ad.  Kate is included in a 
long list of people who are thanked.  
 
Third, "Love And Anger" is No. 9 on the list of Top Modern Rock Tracks of
the year.
 
Fourth, and most amazing of all (at least to those of us who became Kate
fans way before _Hounds Of Love_), Kate Bush is No. 18 on the list of 
Top Female Pop Album Artists!  She's right between Barbra Streisand and
Belinda Carlisle. 
 
 
Ed Suranyi             | "I couldn't hope to do it anywhere near as well
ed@das.llnl.gov        |  as Kate Bush because she is a Goddess."
