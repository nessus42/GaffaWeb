&gt;
&gt;Could someone please post or E-mail the little poem in "Jig of Life"?
 
Can't you see where memories are kept bright
Tripping on the water like a laughing girl?
Time in her eyes is spawning past life
Run on the ocean and the woman unfurls
Holding all the love that waits for you here.
 
Catch us now for a I am your future
A kiss on the wind and we'll make the land.
Come over here to where When lingers
Waiting in this empty world.
Waiting for Then when the life spray cools
For Now does ride in on the curl of a wave
And you will dance with me in the sunlit pools.
 
We are the going water and the gone
We are of water and the holy land of water
And all that's to come runs in 
With the thrust on the strand.
 
---------------
 
Anybody know if KaTe wrote this part herself or if John Carder not only
recited, but also wrote it?
 
Jeff
