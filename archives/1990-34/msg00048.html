The new Homeground, no. 40, popped through my door this morning.  It
contains some interesting stuff.
 
Of course, much is made of the fact that she is going to tour - they
say they have been waiting to print that headline ever since they started
the fanzine.  It seems that very few people knew beforehand - certainly
not the Homeground team, not even Steve Davis.  It seems that a new
album is set for Summer-Autumn '91, too.
 
Of course, there is much space given over to the Convention.  They run
a story of how it was organised, written by Dave, and Krys wrote another
article describes what went on behind the scenes.  Much to my surprise,
they also printed the article I posted to Love-Hounds (edited somewhat)
giving my impressions of the day.  I had sent a copy to them because I
thought they might be interested.  A strange feeling to be in print...
 
They also cover the mixed reception given to the boxed set, printing
some of the good reviews and some of the fan's grumblings.  They attempt
to set the record straight by giving the history of the set.  It seems
that originally EMI, at Homeground's request, had wanted to collect all
the B-sides and rarities (only) onto one volume, although they were
unsure of the format.  This project was shelved when TSW was released, but
revived to cover the interregnum between TSW and KBVII, projected for
third quarter '91.
 
Kate had a different idea though.  She saw here career as entering a
totally new phase, and wanted to round off her previous work more completely.
Hence the complete boxed set.
 
Homeground do reckon that the pricing is somewhat iffy, however.  The fact
that it is being sold, by retailers, as 8 full price albums, when 4 of
these albums are available at mid-price (in the UK, at least) cannot
be justified.  Apparently, EMI's response to this is "It's a fair cop".
 
The set is *not* a limited edition, and there were some 30000 units in the
first run, with more if demand is high enough.
 
Anyway, food for thought.  On 23rd I shall be going home for a couple
of weeks, and will have no net.access during that time.  I wish all
Love-Hounds a Merry Christmas and a Exciting New Year - well, hopefully
we *know* it going to be exciting :-).
 
Before I forget... Chris'n'Vickie, did you get my card?
 
Keep well,
 
Stephen
