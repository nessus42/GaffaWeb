&gt;Really-From: thegrodd@tz.wimsey.bc.ca (The Grodd)

&gt;Given Kate Bush's expressed reticence to tour, and since she's only ever 
&gt;done one, I think it highly unlikely that we'll see her on these shores. The 
&gt;most recent interview I read with her (in Musician magazine in February) had 
&gt;her being quite adamant about not touring.

There is some evidence that she has changed her mind about touring since
the Musician magazine interview.  Here is what we know so far:

1.  At the Kate Bush Convention last month, Kate said that she would like
to do a "few shows, if not a whole tour."  Later, she said that Gary
Hurst and Alan Murphy "would be delighted to know that we are thinking
about touring again."

2.  At the Convention, Del Palmer was asked privately about the
possibility of this tour coming to America.  He said that they
definitely plan to come to the major cities.  (I think he said
she would come to *five* cities.)

3.  CBS Records apparently believes that Kate is going to tour
America.  Their rep in Chicago told this to Vickie.

Of course, none of this is certain, and like many of you I won't
*really* believe it until I have tickets in my hand, but this
is all very hopeful, isn't it?
