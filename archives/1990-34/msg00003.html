&gt;I was just able to acquire the box set locally in Phoenix for $141.14.
&gt;However, I doubt you can get the deal I got.  You see, I had been calling
&gt;up this local record store once a week for six weeks to see if they had any
&gt;news on the box set.  Late last week the manager stumbled across a source
&gt;of CD box sets for $125.99.  She said she'd sell it to me at cost since I'd
&gt;been so patient.  So I got it for $125.99 + shipping + 6.5% sales tax.

&gt;She obtained it from an importer in L.A. (Phantasy? Phantasm? Fantasy?) that
&gt;had 30 of them (but now only has 29 :-) ).

It is Phantom.  They are a CD import wholesale distributer.  Thus us mere 
members of the buying public cannot order directly from them. They distribute 
to quite a large area but you'll have to go to a store which deals with them.  
These are the same guys through whom I got my set only I was charged $175.  So 
there is no guarantee of getting it as low as $142.  In fact I think you were 
as lucky as heck to get it at cost like that.  The store made no profit on it 
at all (unlike my dealer). It is rare indeed for CD importers to be that 
generous.

I am not going to include that on the survey as it is a special case and not 
available to anyone.  

I have not seen any really good prices (less than $170) here in the San Diego 
area at all.
  
Sorry I can't be of further help
