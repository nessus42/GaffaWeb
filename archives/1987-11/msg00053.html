After reading Greg's account of what has happened in the Wicinski pornography
with the intent to verbally exploit women case, things have become more clear.
We are gradually slipping into deep pit, from which we may never emerge if
we don't stop our fall now.  The recent rash of censorship cases culminating
in the 'Raunch-Radio-Rules' is indicating a sudden approval of limiting
creative thought and talent.  To couch this thing in the guise of the ever-
present sexual harassment rules is akin to asserting censorship of rock music
by invoking child antipornography rules.  While sexual harassment and child
pornography are genuine problems which deserve concern and correction, they
should not be waved as banners under which any war may fought just by evocation
of presumed violation by association.  If we think back on this Wicinski thing,
we can be reminded that his sexual comments have not been aimed at only one
person in this group.  Wicinski, if anything, has not shown preference in his
verbal assults (which, I believe have a humorus intent) for either sex.  How
many times has IED been the subject of Tim's sexually sarcastic wit?  There 
have been several references to me which also might have been taken as an
intrusion on my privacy and construed as sexual harassment.  The difference
here lies in the perceptions of the insultees.  I would never accuse Tim
of sexually harassing me because I see the weird humor in all of this.
Similarly, IED has directly responded to Wicinski's comments and gained a bit
of NET-respect by dealing with Tim as 'Wicinski, that joker, what a guy!' bit.
Now in the case of Sue, we have seen more sexually explicit references, and
perhaps they had been taken to the point of requiring an apology.  We must,
however, see these things for what they are 'POOR TASTE'.  Somehow, it doesn't
make sense to censor somebody because they have poor taste.  Some people, i'm
sure do not find Tim's humor to be funny, but then again my parents don't
find Eddie Murphy funny, either.
