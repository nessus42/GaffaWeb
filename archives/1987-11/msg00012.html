Well, Sue, are you really responsible for all this trouble?
IED finds it hard to believe such a thing of you! According to
what Greg Taylor said in his posting to Love-Hounds, you didn't name
specific L-Hs, but just said that "the people" in Love-Hounds
had been abusive. Even that is a bit unfair, no? And you surely
are aware that Wicinski is caustic and insulting to a lot of
people, not just women.

Going on the assumption that someone else actually "told on"
Hofmann and Wicinski, IED is confident that he is not the only L-H who
would appreciate it if you would be kind enough to let
those "sports"-list people (?) know that you didn't mean to imply that
either of our two foul-mouthed but much-liked cynics
should be censored or banished. You DIDN'T mean to imply that,
did you, Sue? Remember the support you received in Love-Hounds when
Wicinski was heaping vitriol on you? Now's your opportunity to
support Love-Hounds in return.

The country has got far too much censorship for anyone's
good as it is. Love-Hounds is one of the few bastions left
for musically oriented types to speak freely, and of all
the Love-Hounds who post regularly to this group, Wicinski
and Hofmann deserve the most support, since their means of
expressing themselves is the most vulnerable to attack from
intolerant outsiders.

Is there anything the Love-Hounds as a group can do to
contest this act of censorship against two of our group?
Doug, maybe we could send a group letter to whichever
moderator had the presumption to silence the Love-Hounds.
By the way, it's obvious that IED is in TOTAL agreement
with Mark Ganzer on this issue. His posting seems to mirror
IED's own feelings of anger and helplessness
at the ignorant acts of the censors.

And just for the record, although Wicinski
was indeed insulting to Sue, the fact is that
he is frequently insulting to lots of people,
both male and female. His epithets and slurs
are indiscriminate as regards sex, but they
are invariably powerfully effective and even,
in this reader's opinion, artful. It would be a
gross violation of American democratic principles
if his voice were suppressed at the unthinking
and Philistine whim of a few miserably inhibited
power-mongers.
