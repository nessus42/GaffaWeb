&gt; From: drukman%UMASS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu
&gt;          (Jonathan S. Drukman)
&gt;
&gt;     The first verse seems pretty clear:
&gt;
&gt; Oh with a mind that renders everything sensitive,
                                        ^^^^^^^^^ 

Could this be "insensitive"?  If so, the "in-" is very soft, but
that's what I hear.  Looking at the song as a whole, I vote for
"insensitive".  Look at the singer and the singee.  The singee thinks
that the singer doesn't care.  The singer admits to caring to the
point of self-exclusion (i.e., caring too much for the singer and not
enough for herself).

&gt; I don't know what I'm given unto every time
             Try:
"I don't know why I give in, [but] I do every time."

The [but] is something that I think my mind wants to add to make up for
lost punctuation.  This version of this line makes more sense in
conjuction with the next line:

&gt; And here I am wondering why I did it again


&gt; I say, you keep me going, you keep the shit away

This is the only line that gives me trouble.  I agree that the above
line sounds right, but something bugs me about it.  The singer seems
to be at odds with the person she's singing to.  She's getting such a
kick at telling him that she's standing up for herself and not giving
in.  I have trouble with her saying that he keeps the shit away.  Her
attitude seems to be that he is the *cause* of any shit that might be
bothering her.

 [ Look, it goes like this:

	"Too-lee-yay, too-lee-yo, too-lee-yay, too-lee-yo, too-lee-yo"
	That's what I say to keep me going -- to keep the shit away

   That explains everything.  -- |&gt;oug ]

On the other hand, she also says "Every time you're near, I feel
you, and I forget myself."  Knowing how Kate likes to write dialogues,
then I can imagine the character almost giving in for a moment, but 
pulling herself back up to say, "Not this time."

&gt;The only line that gives me a hassle is the first line in the second
&gt;verse - I'm not sure I've quite got it.  Any alternate suggestions are
&gt;welcome!

Well, try my version and see if it makes sense to you.

Enjoy.
