WARNING: THIS POSTING CONTAINS LANGUAGE THAT MAY BE OFFENSIVE TO ADULTS

A cassingle of Experiment 4/Wuthering Heights/December Will Be
Magic Again   from New Zealand is now in the import stores. It is
supposed to fairly limited in supply...

Who has the compilation tape now? If it is pretty full after I add
to it (I'm number 8), maybe I'll try to get some copies made to get
other parts of the list and our overseas friends started. But until
the first tape is filled, all this discussion about partitioning the
list is premature.

Dave, we'll have to forgive David Oskard until he's had a chance
to listen to "The Dreaming" more and become a true believer. I don't
know how he sees a SEX factor in our obsession by listening to TD.
To me, there isn't a sexy part in it, I mean how can you consider
vocals that Doug described as sounding like "gargling with razor blades"
SEXY? (unless he's into that kind of thing :-). It is true that much
of Kate's early work could be considered erotic, but she has progressed
far beyond that stage. For me, it's the imagery in her music that attracts
me. Listening to "Night of the Swallow" or "The Nineth Wave" are the
best mind fuck I've had short of (or even with) recreational pharmaceuticals...

In the X4 message, It sounds like we all hear "instruments" as the last
word. However, I do not hear the word "toy" in front of it. It sounds
more like "too". Also, I hear a word between these two words. This is all
complicated by about 5 levels of echo in time with the music. I still
am at a total loss about the words after the initial "I". I'm going to
pass a tape of my experiments to IED and also hope to get a few fresh
ideas at the party next weekend...

In working on the "Watching You Without Me" passage, I came across something
interesting. Right after the SOS and going into the backwards track, there
is a faint sound of a shortwave radio trying to tune in a facsimile signal.
Just another detail in Kate's music to amaze you...

For those who might be interested in the size of rec.music.gaffa on the
Usenet, the April statistics from news.lists shows an estimated
worldwide readership of 3000. 

"In your life, in my life, there are secrets too dark to let let out..."
