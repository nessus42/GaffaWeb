Thanks very much for the kind notice, Cameron.

To Mark Ouellette:
No great disrespect was intended by IED's remarks re Iron Maiden, Mark.
It's great to hear that the band admire Kate's music.
In this listener's opinion, however, it's unfortunate
that that admiration seems nowhere to be reflected in their own music,
which instead conforms all too often to an extremely tired genre.
IED never meant to say that all of Heavy Metal was exclusively
devoted to a single subject; only that there was a definite obsession
among these bands with costume-shop mediaevalism and anachronistic
notions of masculine heroism.
Even you admitted that Iron Maiden often use exactly
the kind of subjects which IED has associated them with.
Your comments about the group do not reduce the
likelihood that their use of 'KT' is a reference to Arthurian chivalry,
magic, loud blood-and-guts bravery, etc. And just for the
record, it's KT, not TK.

Dan -- re "Kate in Dallas":
If Kate actually shows up at that video show
in "Deep Elum" next week and you can prove it, IED will thenceforth
cease forever his annoying third-person self-reference. Deal?
By the way, isn't this the same part of the world where the
Kate-song-in-a-John-Hughes-movie rumour originated?
