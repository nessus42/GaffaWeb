Okay, here's my indoctrination story. . .

Around 1983/84 Greenpeace came out with a compliation album which had 
"Breathing" on it.  "Breathing" quickly became one of my favorite songs
on the album, and I wanted to hear more.  (I had never heard *anything*
like that on the radio, and there was no MTV where I lived.)

So, I bought Never For Ever.  I was overwhelmed by the album.  (I know
that sentiment shows up on this list a lot, so let me add as well, that
I am easily overwhelmed.  But I was OVERWHELMED by this album.  [By the
way, does anyone know anyone who was actually "whelmed" the right amount
by anything?])

So I snarfed up "The Kick Inside" and "On Stage".  A little while later,
I got "Lionheart" (okay, side one doesn't do too much for me, but I
really like side two.)

The rest is history.  I'm almost embarrassed by how taken I am by her;
I bought the marble HoL album, and the Single File, and This Woman's Work,
and I'm still driving a '78 Ford LTD Klunker.  

One has to have priorities.

My nomination for Favorite Kate Album:  whichever one's currently playing.
Favorite Kate Song: Suspended in Gaffa
Close Second: This Woman's Work
Song I would have most liked to see a video for, but didn't: Jig of Life
Who I'd really like to see Kate duet with:  Aaron Neville or Prince
Favorite "Love-Hounds" one-liner this year:  
    "Kate is 18" tall.  Don't be fooled by pictures."
