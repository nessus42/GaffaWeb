<PRE>
Thanks to everybody who has sent in clarifications and corrections
to my description of the "This Woman's Work" pix.  I certainly
learned a lot.  (Maybe someday I'll break down and get a TV so
I can see more of her videos.)  One assumption I made that I'd
like to see either confirmed or refuted is whether the LP set
contains the same pictures.

I'd like to offer a clarification to Andrew Marvick's recent
letter.  At least around here, it is _not_ illegal to purchase
bootleg recordings.  It is only illegal to distribute them.

I know there are as many opinions on bootleg recordings as there
are fans out there, so I'm about to open up a bag of worms and
get flamed, but here goes.  (Actually, I'm sort of looking 
forward to the flames. . .)

IMO IMO IMO IMHO IMVHO (Got it?  Okay:)  I see bootlegs as falling 
into two categories:
        1) Live material and b-sides
        2) Demos, and other unreleased stuff

I don't have much of a problem with bootlegs of the first category.
This material is stuff Kate (or whatever artist you want) had
presented to an audience.  It's stuff she _wanted_ to be heard.
It may be out of print now, or maybe never published, but it was
material that Kate was proud enough of to "give" to a loyal
following.

Demos, on the other hand, are tracks that she wrote, but didn't
let out.  She may have had a good reason for not wanting them
released.  Some of them she may consider inferior, but some of
them may have a personal meaning to her that she later deceided
that she didn't want public.  When I listen to her demos, I feel
like I'm reading someone else's diary.  To me that makes bootleg
demos "more" of a violation than bootleg concerts or bootleg
b-sides.  

This at least is how bootlegs fall on my sensibiliities.
Anyone else care to comment?
