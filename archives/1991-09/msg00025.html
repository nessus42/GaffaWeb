   IED has a very sad task to perform here, folks. Some of you may
know of the recent death of fellow Love-Hound John Byer. John died
on February 15, after a series of illnesses. John was a loyal, long-
time Kate fan and Love-Hound, who was responsible for turning a number
of people on to the magic of Kate and the joys of our little
discussion group. For several years he worked in the California
computer industry, but he had recently moved to Ogden, Utah. Say a
prayer for John, hey? Thanks to Stewart Latham, another terrific
Kate fan, for helping IED with this announcement.

   Now, then. IED would like to say that he has really been enjoying
reading the variety of stories Love-Hounds have been posting recently
about how they first got into Kate. Since we all know the wonderful
feeling of the initiKation riTes, these are the kind of stories we
can all appreciate. 
   For anyone's interest, IED's epiphany was swift and certain--no
gradual awakening for him. The place was Florence, Italy, the time
November, 1977. IED was then just plain old Andrew Marvick, a junior on
his year abroad posing as a callow art student, with nothing but a
cheap AM-FM radio to fulfill his musical needs. It was a dark and 
stormy night, about 2 a.m., and the radio station was Radio
Luxemburg--one of the two stations that picked up on "Wuthering
Heights" months before its official release (the other was Capital
Radio). It was nearly two months before IED learned the name of the
artist, and more than half a year before he could obtain a copy of
_The_Kick_Inside_, but even through the static and the tinny mono
speaker of the pocket radio that night IED knew that he had heard
The Voice of Angels. Now, thirteen and a half years later, he can
still hear them...
   Favorite album: Either _The_Dreaming_ or _The_Ninth_Wave_ (which
can be seen as a short album in its own right)--when all is said  
and done, probably _The_Dreaming_ (please, no gloating from |&gt;oug).
   Favorite song: A tie between _Under_the_Ivy_ and _Ne_T'Enfuis_pas_.
   Least favorite album: A dubious category, but if forced, IED would
say _Never_For_Ever_--which shows you how silly the category is.
   Favorite video: A three-way tie. _Ran_Tan_Waltz_, from the _Kate_
("Christmas") special; _Army_Dreamers_--the "Mrs. Mopp" version from
the German programme "RockPop"; and _Experiment_IV_--the lip-synch
version from _Wogan_. As wonderful as the studio-made promotional
videos are, IED still prefers a select few of the TV-studio lip-
synchs from years past.
   
   IED hopes that some of the silent Love-Hounds who have rarely
or never posted to the group before will take the time to share 
their earliest KT experiences with the rest of us. It's very fun
reading.
   Alex Gibbs asks whether Kate is aware of Love-Hounds. The answer
is yes. At this point Kate has been told plenty about Love-Hounds, 
both by Love-Hounds themselves (in many letters over the years), and
by our much-respected British allies at Homeground Towers, Peter
FitzGerald-Morris and David Cross. David even explained to Kate, 
as he presented her with Love-Hounds' bouquet of four dozen white
roses at the November '90 KonvenTion, that they were a gift from us.
Does she read Love-Hounds? Almost certainly not, alas. Kate's not 
into the fanzines, and she probably wouldn't find most of L-Hs' 
discussions very interesting--or such is IED's opinion, anyway. 
But we know that Kate's brother Paddy has had a PC for five years
or so, and there is reason to believe that Kate and he have had
a modem link for some time, as well. And there is _Deeper_Under-
standing_, so who knows? 
   Speaking of interesting tracks to mix with Kate recordings--
have any of you tried synching up _Hounds_of_Love_ with _Alternative_
_Hounds_of_Love_? It takes some doing, and there are a couple of 
extra bars here and there to be reconciled, but the result--Kate
singing an ad lib countersong to her own original lead vocal, with
the instrumental tracks doubled and a second set of backing vocals--is
devastating.
   Sean asks about the difficulty of finding the "KT" sign on the
covers of _Never_For_Ever_ and _The_Sensual_World_. If you have only
the CD of _NFE_ you will not find the "KT" sign at all--it was found
on a piece of artwork found only on the original 12-inch-size cover
art for the album. Look at the stem of the bloody rose...As for _The_
_Sensual_World_: Again, you'll need the cover of a record-album, 
and preferably the UK original, to see the "KT" sign emerge from the
deep shadows of the right background space on the front cover...On
_Hounds_of_Love_, look on the back cover, at the folds in the nightie
that the sea-racked heroine is wearing. Don't confine yourself to a
single, rigid perspective, either...
   That's all for now, folks. Thanks for making such interesting 
reading of late.
