&gt;So for all of you who think that you don't like some of Kate's
&gt;albums now, wait a few years--you might be surprised.

Yes.  What he said.  The only albums I didn't adore instantly were
_Lionheart_ and _The Dreaming_.  _The Dreaming_ clicked on the second
listen (my excuse is that "Sat In Your Lap" was such an incredible
shock that I couldn't pay any attention to "TGaT" or "POtP," and 
SiG blew me away--listening to the rest of the album at the point was
worthless! :-).  _Lionheart_ definitely took a couple of weeks.  A bunch
of people recently have called it her worst album; two years ago, I would
have agreed.  Now I can't make calls like that, as I love all of her albums.
I'm not at a point where I listen to TKI and TSW less than the others, but
I still love them.  There is no worst album...once you acknowledge that
everything pales beside "The Ninth Wave."

&gt;As for me, I have yet to decide whether I want to get the box set
&gt;or not.  However, all the recommendations for "Under the
&gt;Ivy" are piquing my curiosity,

If anything, I was disappointed by "Under the Ivy," simply because it didn't
live up to the expectations I had from .gaffa.  Not that it's not an incredible
song--just not what I expected.

&gt;and the possibility of hearing "Un
&gt;Baiser D'enfant" is hard to resist--"The Infant Kiss" is
&gt;devastating in English, and I'm looking forward to the French
&gt;version melting my brain.

I find "Un Baiser D'Enfant" to be very interesting. A lot of the beauty and
passion of the lyrics are lost in the translation (btw, does anybody know
who wrote the translation?  Was it KaTe or someone else?), and I think a
little bit of the passion of the actual singing is lost.  On the other hand,
I think the rhythm of the melody is *much* prettier in french.  I think
it's time to pop in the CD.  Now.

"Je dit bon nuit, nuit..."

Ahhhhhh.

Jeff
