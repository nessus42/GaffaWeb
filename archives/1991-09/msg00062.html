<PRE>
   Came in 1985 - late for some, but I was still young then, when I'd become 
completely fed up with commercial radio and Philadelphia's WXPN hadn't been 
taken over by suits.  I heard Running Up that Hill first, then Lionheart 
later the same night.  A friend I'd made at the station, who only played 
music by women, was always good far playing Breathing or another KaTe track 
on her show.

   By that time, I already owned the marblised cassette of Hounds of Love, 
and the CD of The Kick Inside with the fighter-kite import cover.  Not having 
a CD player (I still don't, but I own four CD's - The Kick Inside, The 
Sensual World, Enigma's MCMXC a.D., and k.d. lang's Absolute Torch and Twang) 
I buttonholed a friend into letting me dub it on his machine - and wound up 
lending him the CD almost permanently.  The legend spread.  By the time I'd 
graduated high school (class of '86), I'd created about two dozen worshippers 
of Saint KaTe.

   This is my first post on Usenet, and I've never really had access to 
enough well-connected (or well-rumor-fed) people to ask for Kate news.  So 
it's question time.
   1) Except for Saturday Night Live, I've never heard of Kate ever coming to 
the United States.  (Based on some of her songs, especially on Hounds of 
Love, I theorised that she was afraid of crossing the ocean.)  Why doesn't 
she ever seem to cross the pond?
   2) What dates have been announced for the 1991-92 World Tour?

I ssuppose I should work on a little sign-off box now, but I'll leave you as

R-og
