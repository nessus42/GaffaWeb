The first Kate song that I heard and recognized as such was "Running
Up That Hill" (early '86).  Without much understanding it, I thought
that it was one of the scariest songs I had ever heard.  I had no
disposition towards her other single, "Cloudbusting", and had no idea
what the fuss was about.

Some time later (late '86), my friend played her Kate tape, and I
suddenly recognized a tune from my youth that had haunted me, but for
which I knew neither the title nor the artist.  The song turned out
to be "Wuthering Heights", and my interest rose.

Some more time later (early '89), as I was discovering USENET and
reading rec.music.misc, someone asked for info on Kate, and was
directed to gaffa.  I too looked there, and at that time there were
quite a few interviews and summaries of her work.  "The Dreaming" was
cited fairly unanimously as the one to get, the one with the most
Kate-ness.  That very day I bought a copy of the CD, without having
heard any of the songs, without having heard OF any of the songs, and
in fact not knowing such an album existed before that day.

My first reaction was --- WEIRD!!!!!   Keep in mind that at the time my
yardstick of rock music was Rush's "Moving Pictures".  After several
go-rounds it began to grow on me, and soon became firmly entrenched.
Even as a collected the other Kate albums, "The Dreaming" remained my
sentimental favorite.



Ray Peck (rpeck@jessica.stanford.edu) says that Ayn Rand's "Atlas
Shrugged" is the best book he's ever read.  I would rate this second,
behind Robert Pirsig's "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance".
This should be required reading, maybe a required course, for all
university students.  "Atlas Shrugged" is awesome in itself in its
scope and complexity.  Rand's "The Fountainhead" is also worthy of
note.  It is not as developed, but I identify with Gail Wynand!
