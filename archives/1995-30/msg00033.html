Hi Karen.  My name is Len.

[Karen:  kln@a.crl.com]

| I hope to see in the near future the evolution of an
| experiential artform composed of the marriage of
| current art media, and a few not even thought of yet. I
| also hope to see Kate dive in with the gusto she's shown
| in filmmaking.

Good.  True.  Two guys on the committee that
created the SGML hypermedia standard are musicians
who hope that a strong enough standard for creating this
art might give Kate an ultimate medium with which to do
her finest work.  Hypermedia is push and pull.
Artist, art, and audience become a maker of worlds.
Like you, I hope she does build a splendid studio
not just for sound and video, but for hypermedia.

Hypermedia can host the finest work of Kate Bush.
It is an artform in which she can be one, perhaps, the
most innovative practicioners of the form just as
the form emerges.

It frees art from the physical but enhances the sensual.
....but the computers can be a big pain in the patoot.  ;-)

One of Kate's greatest talents has been to bring mime
and modern dance to rock.   She is a classic English
beauty, alabaster skin, great luminous eyes, and
the grace of one who trusts without question that
she can be what she imagines.  Her eye for image,
her ear for syncopation and melody, her ability
to take rare and difficult subjects and weave
intricately layered symbol sets are genius.

But, as Joni Mitchell sang, "Songs to aging children come."

Dance is hard.  Very hard.  And exhausting.
The BestSong takes the most effort.
And there is that life thing...  Others.

The heart can endure.  The body cannot.

Ever since 1975 or so, a brilliant and very creative
young woman, Kate Bush has lead a team
of people, remarkable all in their talents, all geniuses,
always there for her, by the magick of her music and
imagination.  She has been a fountain of hope and
understanding, first for her team, and then for all of us.

She is the undisputed boss.  The woman as Captain.
She has achieved this in a business not known for
its kindness, and she has done this by kindness
and an implacable ability to persuade No to become Yes.

I love her.  No doubt.  No thought of stopping.  No need.

Worship her?  No.  Because she is still Cathy Bush
who imagined Kate Bush and made of that personna
a world of dreams that we could share and by that
sharing, be made happy.  A woman who does that,
a human that does that, does not deserve to by my
thought or action or desire be stripped of her humanity.

To worship is to deify.  That is a cruel fate for one you love.

So what will she make of her house and her life?
Whatever she wants.  That is the good of it.

Will she make more art?

Kate Bush has always worked her buns off.
Old habits are dependable.  There is a new kind of
world to make, and perhaps a song to call it to life.
She loves what she loves... a blessing on her house.
