Hi!

I was mentioned on gaffa! I was mentioned on gaffa!

Our honorable friend IED writes:

&gt; &gt; Did this inspire the Fruitopia people to contact Kate, or 
&gt; &gt; was Kate inspired to include this imagery because of her work 
&gt; &gt; for Fruitopia, or is it a happy case of synchronicity (the
&gt; &gt; meaningful connection of events [seemingly] unrelated in
&gt; &gt; cause)?
&gt;
&gt;None of us knows, really, but the last possibility you cite seems the most
&gt;likely: that is, that Fruitopia offered the job to her because she was a
&gt;favorite of someone at the company, but that Kate accepted at least in part
&gt;because of the happily synchronicitous confluence of the visual materials
&gt;associated with their respective products.

Or she was contacted _before_ the release of TRS (we all know how slowly
KaTe works...) and she was offered a truckload of money to incorporate the
fruit in the sleeve design, thus creating a possible market of all
Kate-Lovers worldwide.
I know, highly unlikely, yet very amusing if you like complot-theories... :-)

&gt; &gt; Kate does the exquisite musical morsels that mix in with
&gt; &gt; the mouth watering visuals.   :-)  
&gt; &gt; haven't you recognized her musical style?
&gt;
&gt;We don't yet have confirmation that the Fruitopia spots now airing in The
&gt;Netherlands are those featuring Kate Bush's music. Remember that the UK
&gt;campaign features only the music of the Cocteau Twins. This may well obtain
&gt;in Holland, as well.  Perhaps Marcel Rijs could settle this question for us?

Fruitopia is still well out of sight in The Netherlands. Moreover, I have
been searching for Fruitopia in London when I was there last July, but it
wasn't available anywhere.
I expect we (the Dutch) will have to wait at least until next year. I can't
think of many (soft)drinks being introduced in the winter. And usually it
takes Coca-Cola years to introduce a new drink after they did it in the US.
That's BTW why we didn't have to deal with the "ALL NEW Coca-cola" crap a
couple of years ago.

I am getting a bit curious how Fruitopia tastes, after seeing those
delightful commercials.... (Probably a letdown, huh?)
