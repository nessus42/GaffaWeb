&gt;	As others on this group have noted profound changes in their
&gt;lives (such as births and weddings), I'd similarly like to mention the
&gt;passing of my dear friend and soulmate Michael Dowell from AIDS on
&gt;September 15th, 1995.

   Terribly sorry to hear of your loss. No words can truly comfort, only
time can ease the sorrow.

   We have lost several friends to this desease. The hardest was the loss
of our good friend Tim Hathcock. We met Tim via a friend at a record store as 
he was looking for Japanese imports of Kate LPs. He became a friend and part 
of our extended family, eventually sharing a house and a couple of different 
apartments. 

  Amazingly Kate was one of the few areas where our musical tastes coincided.
His main musical interests were classical, Bach and Bruckner to Pendrecki and
Legitti. He was a *major* "golden ear" audiophile. At his memorial service
some of his friends played some Kate songs. But the background music system
couldn't be turned all the way off, remaining at the edge of perception.
Various people stood up and talked about Tim. One person mentioned that,
if he was here, the *first* thing Tim would say is "Could we *please* turn
that Muzak off!" Everyone cracked up.

&gt;	Although he was not a big Kate fan (I did catch him listening
&gt;to 'Ken' and 'Shoedance' on occasion), he endured my incessant Kate-
&gt;playlist with admirable resolve. He was kind, uncomplaining and
&gt;consistently tenacious in his efforts to battle the disease, and to
&gt;make his life about living, not about dying.
&gt;
&gt;	I miss him beyond what words can express.

   I hope you can eventually find your happiness. Remember him, but remember
that he loved you and wants you to be happy.
