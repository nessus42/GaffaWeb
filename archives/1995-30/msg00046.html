Why do you dislike Fruitopia sodas?
Partly because of the doofy ads and mostly because of that nuts-o chick
Doctress Fruitopia on USENET. [??]

What's with Fruitopia??? Those ads get in your brain and won't let go.
Cloying and sticky brain memes that suck...sugarwater.

TRAVELLING FRUITOPIA
Until recently, I thought that Fruitopia simply had scary flashback
commercials and cool vending machines that provided glass bottles of
annoyingly titled juice. However, I clearly underestimated them.
They ALSO have a multicolored bus that's touring the nation this summer; a
bus that
houses the travelling Fruitopia Show. I was lucky enough to catch it here in
New York.
Play it Fruitopia man!
After the end of this promotional show, I spoke with Jim Hinde, singer for
the Fruitopia tour (after he handed out complimentary bottles of "Fruit
Generation"). I wanted to know if he sang original lyrics or if his songs
had a special Fruitopia angle to them.
"This show is basically run concurrent, but by itself in relation to the
drink." said Jim. "I haven't changed any lyrics to my songs, and none of it
is based on Fruitopia, does that make sense?"

THE BEST PRODUCTS OF 1994
Fruitopia
"Citrus Consciousness" and "Strawberry Passion Awareness" hardly sound like
Coca-Cola products. But when the Atlanta soft-drink maker introduced these
and other flavors in its new line of Minute Maid Fruitopia drinks last
summer, thirsty consumers could not get enough of the noncarbonated,
fruit-based beverages. With catchy advertising and Coke's distribution
muscle behind it, Fruitopia has wasted no time grabbing a sizable share of
the Snapple-led fruit-drink market, like a parched softball player after a
hot game.

Fruitopia officially symbolizes everything in the universe that makes loyal
Scorched Earth Party members psychitically violent. We have no problem with
the ultimate coopting of counterculture values by corporate America. We're
all for it. However, in doing so, we are being bombarded with the most
unpleasant anti-hideous violence propaganda imaginable.
You know how the commercials go. Psychedelic fruit, throbbing and pulsing
rhythmically across the screen. Peaceful, lulling, psyche-penetrating music.
Then messages flash on the screen, like:
Everything should be...
Perfect and beautiful and nice...
And it will be...
Because you are so enlightened...
Because you drink...
Raspberry Anti-homophobia Ripple
...
This must stop. ....
- Jeff Vogel  Scorched Earth Party

Words of wisdom found on bottles of Fruitopia(tm)

Fruit Integration

The person next to you 
loves you very much.  
Please share your 
Fruit Integration 
with him/her.

The Grape Beyond

Things that are still right in the cosmos: 
The perfection of a circle, 
Beethoven's 9th, 
white t-shirts, 
and baseball.

Raspberry Psychic Lemonade

There is a wonderful person inside you
who is dying to get out.
Please drink Raspberry Psychic Lemonade
and free your spirit!

Strawberry Passion Awareness

If you can't judge a fruit
by the color of its skin,
how can you judge a person
by theirs?

Tangerine Wavelength

find the line
between
joy and bliss.

Apple Raspberry Embrace

When in doubt,
HUG!

Tropical Consideration

War isn't.
 Peace will be.
Tropical Consideration is.

Chaos is ...
Chaos is really just another kind of order. Or at least, I think it said
something like that in a Fruitopia commercial.
