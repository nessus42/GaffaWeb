Okay, so I was duped.  How can you tell when everyone in
Mr. Ralph's cafe is saying "Prince is dead, did you hear?  he died this
morning."

Apparently thisa regular  rumor that surfaces on the Prince
board every few months.  Thank god we don't have THAT kind
of nonsense to contend with.  How everyone at the cafe was 
drawn into this I have no idea.

BTW, Prince may WISH he was dead after the article in Forbes
this week detailing the extremely poor conditions of his finances,
of his relationship with the record company, and his problems with
getting anything new released.  

The article says he is tens of millions of  dollars in debt to the record
company, who have just loaned him another bunch of money to 
finish this latest album.  He has several albums worth of music in the
can, has built complete sets for a tour he never went on, and has
produced a number of expensive ($500,000 ea.) music videos which
have also never seen the light of day.  

Not to mention endless arguments with record company types.  Hell, I
guess I'd be a little worried too if someone had spent millions of my 
dollars and didn't look like they were going to pay them back . . .
