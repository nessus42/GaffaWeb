Dear lovehounds, 

This year I had a very restful and quiet holliday at the house of my
parents. The 
weather was absolutely brilliant and I spent most of my time in the wonderful 
garden. I put up a table outside and installed a computer ('is this boy
completely 
mad?'). Then I worked myself through the jungle of 1993/1994 lovehounds-mail to 
find some Deeper Understanding ('he is!'). 

Wow, and I finished everything in 3 weeks. The result is something I called: 

                         Moments 
                A Red Shoes Collection 

and it contains everything I found interesting for me concerning "The Red 
Shoes". 

Initially I did this for my own purpose, only. But then I thought, maybe you're 
also interested, because all the stuff in the archive, the invaluable
Garden- and 
Cloudbusting- files, ends ca. 1991. So maybe my collection fills a gap. It
is not THE collection, but A collection. 

I separated the mail in different categories. Mainly: a) TRS, b) anything else 
interesting, c) trash. The last item was the biggest one :-). I deleted more 
than 3/4 of everything. But the rest is really timeless and worth to be
collected. 

The editing of the TRS-part is now finished and you can find it in the archive
on ftp.uu.net  in:  /usenet/rec.music.gaffa/moments .

How I did it: 
First I selected the interesting content and deleted the unneccesary parts
(longish 
headers (Hello Graham!) and signatures (hello Graham! Your address is not very 
thrilling!). I left "Date", "From" and "Subject". I also deleted sometimes
substantial parts of the mail, if they were not interesting (to me),
repetitions or personal things. I changed sometimes the subject entry, to
fit better to the actual subject. I also corrected some obvious spelling
errors etc. I made a very few comments by myself, they come in [ ] with my
short WIE in case of doubt. 

Quotes were a little problem, because the "&gt;" signs are useless after making up 
the pages for grouped style. So, quotes are now started with a "&gt;", but not
in front of every line, only at the beginning of each paragraph. The quote
is separated from the following statement, by a blank line. 

I ordered the mails in different categories: 

1. History

1.1. Pre-History
1.2. Aspel
1.3. Tower
1.4. Convention '94
1.5. Misc./History

2. The Music

2.1. Lyrics
2.2. LH comments on songs
2.3. LH comments on whole album

3. The Film

3.1. Videos 
3.2. The original Story and Film
3.3. The Line, The Cross And The Curve

4. Words

4.1. The Interviews
4.2. Reviews
4.3. Charts
4.4. Discography

5. Miscellaneous

5.1. The Man I Love
5.2. Sexual Healing
5.3. Frutopia

Everything is ca. 1.1 MB! Edited for printing it's ca. 400 pages (hui!). 

Maybe not everything is complete, it just reflects my own preferences. For 
example, I am not so much interested in your 'best of' things and ratings,
like: "Eat the Music": C-, or "Rubberband Girl": B+ etc. I have my own list
in my head and that's enough. 

I also deleted: 
- most of the Lily/Angel stuff, 'cause it gave no new inside into the
subject, as 
Chris pointed out unsuccessfully in the very beginning. 
- Sex and the 'Symbol' stuff: mainly abstruse theories. 
If I skipped something, that should be definitely included, please tell me! 
Especially, if there are more interviews, please mail them to me and to the
group! 
It's my sincere hope, that this imperfect medley helps somehow to a new, 
completely revised edition of The Garden. I think, it's a heavy burden on IED's 
shoulder. This is my little contribution. 

It was very fascinating to walk through 2 years in 3 weeks. The end of 1993 was 
the most interesting part: the release of TRS! We got new interviews (I
strongly 
recommend IED's restored version of the Sunday Times interview by Chrissy Iley) 
and this magic day at NY Towers, very moving reviews by Doug, IED, Deb Wentorf 
and Jason Pascucci. Thank you very much! 

1994 we had the Convention with very interesting reports. There was some 
discussion on the quiz. I think this is a matter of preparation! Were you
really well prepared? I also noticed, that there was NOT ONE, who was upset
about Kate's 
*short* appearance, not One! (In contrast to the unnecessarily enlarged
discussion in Homeground. Peter!) The only thing lovehounds mentioned: there
was not enough 
food! 

4. Aug. 1994: Robert Lovejoy discovered the Fruitopia article, followed by
extensive commercial watching. 

Thank you all, for doing the work. IED and Andrew Marwick for the Garden 
and their prolonged efforts to keep you on the kateian track, Ron Hill for his 
Cloudbusting (both invaluable compilations!), Uli for his continuous
distribution of information and all the people who hacked in the lyrics,
reviews and interviews. 
Thank you! 

Other things/people that attracted my special attention: 

- IED: Still mysterious, but definetly no human being. "Some groups have a 
moderator. We have an Enforcer. IED enforces the KaTe orthodoxy. Whenever he's 
away from the group (say, because Andrew Marvick is pursuing something trivial 
like a Ph.D.), the group begins to drift, become unruly, and has less KaTe
content." (Andy Gough) 

- Andrew Marwick = apostle Peter, head of the fundamentalist church of Kate 
Bush. KaTe is God (Amen!). It's unbelievable to me how he managed it to work on 
his doctoral thesis and do *on the side* all his investigations. Or was that
IED? 

- stev0: "The Line, the Cross, the Curve and Her Lover" Master of the Joke! 
Some of his contributions are absolute masterpieces. "If Lovehounds is a
game, I 
win!" You really should go professional! Give us another one! 

- Uli: distributor and editor of the holy FAQ. He also worked on THE 
discography: Out now! I comes on 12 CD's with a 1054 pages booklet. 

- Jon-"Eat the Music" *still* sucks!-Drukman: a strong fighter, with a warm 
heart. But caution when you say something that provokes contradiction. Jump
behind 
the lines when he rises. He and stev0 always carry guns (and heavy-duty
gaffa-tape) 
and come in full metal jackets.  Jon where are you at the?

- Homeground-Peter: Good for short urgent HG-Towers-information, but 
generally more a taker. That's a great pity, because I think, he has so much
to give! Maybe we should ask him more!!! Ooh, he has compiled a 15 pages
videolist! Haven't seen it so far (Peeeeteer, helloohooo!). 

- Vickie: Who discovered, that you have to break your earphones to get a 
complete inside into "The Dreaming"! (phase cancelation) 

and:
-Brian J Dillard: "I dropped my walkman last night and now it plays backwards! 
so I should have all sorts of wonderful new insights to share with all of
you very very soon . . " 
- Chris: something like the answer-man of the group. I have found him not the 
least bit authoritarian, but always fair and fairly objective. With stoical
coolness he answers all the questions, that come up every month or so. 
- Karen Newcombe: Always at her place. IED says: "She's, in his opinion, the
best 
thing that's happened to Kate Bush fandom in AGES." 
- Scott Telford: provider of the TRS-discography and many other front-line 
reports. 
- Prof. Manchester, who educates us with his well-founded statements. 
- Doug: the fabulous LH founder, |&gt;oug /\lan said: "John Carder Bush told me
all 
sorts of things that Kate would do her best to avoid talking about." - Can
you please enlighten us!!! 

And: 
- for a while KaTe was pregnant! 
- 334 subscribers 13.5.94 
- only once in these two years someone (in this music oriented group)
referred to 
specified notes/keys : Jonathan Forward: "When was the inferior D,D,up an
octave &amp; 
F replaced by the much better D,C,F,D,Bflat,F?" (conc. DWBMA) 
- also only once someone posted a GIF! 

- we also have a Super-Dave! 
- a Jorn"All-I-wanted-was-a-Pepsi"Barger 
- a Marcel"De Efteling is in Kaatsheuvel, not Amsterdam. Not even "near" 
Amsterdam"Rijs 
- Charlie Baum: the guy with the strangest story: his friend saw a Miami Vice 
episode with the "Hello Earth" piece in it. He instantly recogniced it as a
georgian tune and taped it. Then he played it to Charles (also a georgian
music expert), who tracked it down to KaTe and got hooked. So BTW he brought
this georgian subject to our all attention. 
- and: David Eugene Vinson: "Can anybody out there confirm my existence? Uli 
doesn't believe in me, but I  could swear that I have been around since the
end of 
October. Have there been any confirmed sightings of me during that time? I
want to 
live!!!!" 

After many "Moments of Pleasure": There was this one really irritating
explosion 
of madness: The Jorn-Chris/Vickie-Escalation. I had prepared a long paragraph 
about the whole thing, but I deleted it. This is just a reminder for peace. 

In general it was always very interesting to see, how people jump on one train 
and not on the other. Some mails have been left completely ignored, while
others 
provoked intense monthlong discussions/flaming and all that. I couldn't
figure out 
so far what this spice is, you have to include into your mail. I therefore
await eagerly, on what point of this mail you will jump on! 
Also people post long sermons of stuff/nonsense and state at the end something 
like: "Unfortunately, this whole topic is rather off charter. Let's not
discuss this any more." 

To prove the usefulness of this group, just think of the tape-trees, the
T-shirt 
project. etc. It's always very easy to bring up new ideas, but to put them into 
practice is a different thing. I also have to point out the great real
knowledge latent available in this group. There is much blah-blah, but if
there is really need for an answer, it will be given! 

So, that was MH impression after 2 years lovehounds in 3 weeks. 
Okay, here it is. Do with it what you want!

I hope, you'll enjoy reading! Don't drive too slowly!

entirely mad!
