Wretched...yes.  I agree with you.  I don't think it's your place to 
tell me what to put in my .sig though.  I happen to be concerned by the
fact that the "Church" of Scientology is raiding the homes and businesses
of netizens and Internet Service Providers because they don't like
to be criticized.  The outcome of the fight against what they're doing
can (and will) affect nearly every Internet user.  It's important to
everybody on the net.

Btw, the Co$ is censoring critical views in the AOL folders.  If you
think they're so wretched then maybe you should investigate what's
happening at your own ISP.  You'd be appalled.

This is the only time I'll post anti-scientology political views in
the body of a post here in gaffa, but what I use as a .sig is my
own business.  

I don't mean to sound snappy but the only time I've spoken up against 
the Co$ in gaffa has been in certain .sig lines I've used.  I would never
have brought it up in the body of a post is KateManiac hadn't commented
on it.  I'm not out to fight with anyone (except $cientologists, and then
I'd move it to e-mail or alt.religion.scientology).

 =======================================================================

                  Have you been hurt by Scientology(tm)?
 
Victims of Scientology(tm) are often plagued by feelings of shame,
isolation, helplessness and fear.  They feel there is nothing they can 
do, and nowhere they can turn.
  
If this describes you, or anyone you know, you need to be aware of a new
avenue of help, via the computer Internet.  People from around the world
are joining together to share the pain and frustration Scientology(tm) has
caused them.  People from around the world are working together to stop
the coercive and criminal behavior of Scientology(tm) organizations.  This
is all happening in the Internet discussion group called
alt.religion.scientology.
