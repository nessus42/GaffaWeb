&gt; &gt; I've been listening to the extra CD's from the This Woman's Work box 
&gt; &gt; set.  The 2nd song on the 2nd disc is called, "Ken," and the CD claims 
&gt; &gt; it's from a "Comic Strip" movie GLC.  I'm American, and I get no cool 
&gt; &gt; TV.  Isn't Comic Strip that Rik Mayall/Ade Edmonson show that was up a 
&gt; &gt; few years back?  Either way, can anyone tell me about Ken and the GLC?
&gt; 
&gt; Not being too political (in my head, nor on this group) the GLC stands
&gt; for the "Greater London Council" which used to exist and was "headed"
&gt; by Ken Livingstone, before the Maggie Thatcher Goverment got rid of
&gt; the idea of local governments. At the time I seem to remember Maggie
&gt; "had it in for" Ken, but maybe that was just the media. They painted
&gt; Ken to be a really nice guy, he seemed to be doing nice things for the
&gt; people and the city, but it could all be fabrication, newspapers like
&gt; to publish a good/bad story. The Comic Strip which consists of a group
&gt; of modern comedians (not sure on all of them, but there's about 5 or 6,
&gt; I'll guess at Rik and Ade - as you said, but also Dawn French, perhaps
&gt; also Jen Saunders, Robbie Coltraine, Hugh Laurie and Steven Fry, I've
&gt; missed someone or two), and they made a "Charles Bronson" parody of
&gt; the GLC vs Maggie incident.
&gt; 
&gt; Please someone correct my mistakes!

Yep, same film. It was recently made available on video in the UK 
along with The Strike on the same video (The prequel to GLC).
Ben Elton and Nigel Planer are also in it along with a couple of 
others like Peter Richardson, Keith Allen and Alexi Sayle.
The video is made by Polygram, is a 15 cert and costs about 11.99 
ukp. It also contains Once Last Look Around The House Before We Go (a 
song probably in Kate's head at the moment) and Running Up That Hill. 
I can't remember if they're the only ones or not, I might check 
tonight.
