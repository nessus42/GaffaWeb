Archive-name: music/kate-bush-faq-diffs
Last-modified: 1995/09/20
Version: 1.3.u minus 1.3.q

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action.  The full version is posted to
rec.music.gaffa only.  You can get a full copy of the FAQ by requesting it from
me (uli@zoodle.robin.de).  If you subscribe to the list (done by sending
email to love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net) Bill Wisner will also provide you
with the full FAQ.  If you can't receive more than 64KB in one piece I can
split the FAQ for you.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.  Cosmetical changes aren't listed.


ATTENTION:
==========

This time the FAQ isn't as up-to-date as it should be, because I've still
over 2000 mails in my incoming mailbox. That's because I'm in the office
now from normally about 9:30 am to 10-12 pm. And since I'm on holiday the
next couple of weeks, I won't be able to:

a) answer requests for the full FAQ (ask Bill Wisner instead, )
b) read my email backlog to update the FAQ
c) read my email backlog between coming back from holiday and the next FAQ
   posting time either (it'll be about 5000 mails in my mailbox by then)
d) post anything else but this month's FAQ next month.
e) answer private email...

0.   Really Frequently Asked Questions

     Also known as 'Read Before Posting'.  Please excuse stev0's [SB] humor...


     Q:  Is it OK to talk about other artists on Lovehounds?
     A:  Yes.  It is encouraged. [see also 1.1.]

     Q:  Even at length?
     A:  Yes.  Well, don't go TOO far - posting multi-megabyte discographies is
         frowned on (and yes, people have done that).  Use your judgement.
         [see also 1.1.]

     Q:  Can I even talk about Tori Amos?
     A:  Yes, you can even talk about Tori Amos. [see also 2.2.]

     Q:  What about Happy Rhodes?
     A:  Er, that will be all for today... [see also 2.1.]

[A couple of new ones, at least for the FAQ... sorry for the missing
separate RFAQ last week, but as stated above, I'm quite busy at the moment]

2.2. Who is Tori Amos?

     *** rdt is currently down due to technical problems ***

[Gee - see what I meant when I said it's not up-to-date? Tori's mailing
list is back online, problems hopefully solved.]

2.3. Other mailing lists that might be of interest

     Loreena McKennitt - Old Ways

        *** currently down, will move to a new address soon ***

        subscribe: old-ways-request@tomservo.b23b.ingr.com
                   Manually.
        post:      old-ways@tomservo.b23b.ingr.com

[and again, the list is back (under a different address than the above),
but as far as I've noticed has still some technical problems]

4.5. Other Artists using Kate's Work

     Cover versions of Kate's songs:

     The Man With The Child In His Eyes
        Julie Covington &amp; Richard Thompson - ?
            (available on bootleg CD 'Kate Bush - Collaborations')

[New entry of old recording]

4.6. Chart success

     Babooshka:
        G: 14

[Found out that Babooshka managed to get up to 14 in Germany, instead
of just 29 as stated before]

5.8. The Red Shoes

     Moments of Pleasure
        This song is Kate's tribute of several of her friends who've
        passed away.  Murph is Alan Murphy, her guitarist who died in
        1993(?) of AIDS.  Bill is Bill Duffield, the lighting technician
        for The Tour of Life, who died in an accident while setting up
        for the tour.  "Teddy" is the late John Barratt, assistant engineer at
        Abbey Road Studios during the recording sessions for "Never for Ever".
        Bubba is for Gary Hurst (dancer in '79 tour), Maureen is Kate's
        aunt [YS, WW].  No one (except Kate, as far as I know - [SB]) knows who
        anyone else is in this song, especially "George the Wipe".  The verse
        about the "balcony in New York" refers to her meeting of Michael
        Powell, director of the film "The Red Shoes".

[Confirmation that Maureen is Kate's aunt]

5.9. Miscellaneous

     Fruitopia Commercials
        Kate did the music for nine commericials only seen on American TV
        for Fruitopia, a line of fruit drinks produced by Minute Maid (which
        is a subsidiary of the Coca-Cola company).  There was also a longer
        advertisement seen in movie theatres which Kate also did the music
        for.  Another series of Fruitopia Commercials just started, the
        first one being spotted during a commercial break of the '95 Academy
        Awards show.  The British versions of the Fruitopia commercials don't
        contain Kate's music, but rather Elisabeth Fraser from the Cocteau
        Twins.  The original US commercials (i.e. those with Kate's music)
        do have caleidoscopic effects, short subtitles, and just Kate's music
        on the audio channel.  Kate's voice can be heard, though there are
        no words to be understood.

[Description of US commercials added, to help identifying them]
