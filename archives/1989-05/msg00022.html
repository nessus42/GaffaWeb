&gt; In article &lt;4YEbkBy00VsfEFjUUR@andrew.cmu.edu&gt; Love-Hounds@GAFFA.MIT.EDU
&gt; writes:
&gt; &gt;Someone needs to find out how many tapes are needed.  Perhaps someone should
&gt; &gt;volunteer to take orders, so that the person who will eventually do the
&gt; &gt;duplication will know how much work he/she should expect.
&gt; Ok, I think there is a difinite misunderstanding here...
&gt; I have said that I will take care of duplicating tapes.  I was referring to
&gt; AUDIO TAPES.  Are these tapes VIDEO?

I don't know where the misunderstanding could have arisen.  Only audio tapes are
being discussed.  HiFi VCR's are involved only to the point of being a
reasonably high-quality audio recorder.


&gt; &gt;I have a Panasonic PV-4860 HiFi VCR and access to a NAD cassette deck.  I will
&gt; &gt;also offer to make copies, though I would prefer to do so from a
&gt; &gt;first-generation master.
&gt; Then, I think it is best that YOU do this copying since you seem to

&gt; ``know what you are doing.''  I will send you all the orders that I have
&gt; reseived, IF YOU EVER MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

I apparently said something that upset you.  Let me try to clarify myself.

I said the first time that I wasn't making comments about anyone in particular.
My concerns are twofold:

1) multiple-generation copies of tapes build up tape hiss and distortion.  A
tree-structured distribution scheme can go arbitrarily deep, and can leave an
unlucky few with tapes that they may not be able to appreciate because they
sound so bad.

2) tapes that are carelessly made also sound bad, especially if they are used as
masters for yet another generation of tapes.

My offer to assist with the tape duplication was one to widen, not deepen the
distrubution tree.  That way, more people would get higher quality tapes.  It
was not meant to be a statement about anyone in particular, and it certainly
wasn't one saying "I want to make all the tapes because I want it to be done
right."

If you suspect that a) I am being insulting or b) my motives are selfish, you
are welcome to do the taping without my help.   It is becoming more and more
apparent that one person will not be able to cope with the number of requests.
