 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: Latest word on tape distribution projeKT

     Well, halelujah, Bob Thaden and John Bankert have both
offered their copying services, and both have multiple real-time
dubbing equipment at their disposal! Scott Yelich--and the others
who offered to make copies--your generosity is still appreciated but
apparently no longer required.
     IED has nearly finished making the "master" tape. He will
mail it to Bob Thaden tomorrow. Meanwhile, everyone on the list
should get their blank-tape-and-SSAE packages ready. Don't mail
out your packages until we've actually heard from Bob one more time
that he is really willing to do such a large number of dubs.
     Also, IED awaits similar confirmation from John Bankert,
as well as his mailing address. If both of these admirable
Love-Hounds are ready to start copying, IED will make two "masters",
and send the second to John, rather than sending him a dub. Once (if)
both of them have confirmed their willingness, then all Love-Hounds whose
names were on the _first_ list (nos. 1/25) should mail their packages to
Bob Thaden, and all the others (whose names appear as nos. 26 through 52
in the list below) should mail their packages to John
Bankert. IED repeats: please do _not_ send your packages off until
John and/or Bob have confirmed. Otherwise your packages may
be wasted. Needless to say, a HUGE thankyou to Bob and John!
     Here is the total contents of the 90-minute cassette,
which has been recorded with Dolby B (Dolby C being still
uncommon for many people, and thus oddly distorting to the
sound for some listeners):

 SIDE A:
 ^^^^^^^
 1. _Maybe_ (aka _Davy_). A song which Kate played about one minute
of in 1978, on a UK radio programme called _Personal_Call_. The
version she played this brief excerpt from comes from the same sessions
in which Number 2 was recorded:

 2. _Passing_Through_Air_. The second b-side track of the _Army_
_Dreamers_ single, this track, like Number 1, dates from the summer
of 1973, and Dave Gilmour's home, where Gilmour and a couple of
his friends met to record a number of Kate's songs. _Maybe_ (but
not _PTA_) was later re-recorded more carefully for the _TKI_
sessions, but neither version was ever officially released.

 3. _The_Kick_Inside_. IED is not sure of the date of this demo
(or of the date of Numbers, 4, 5 and 6, all of which are from
the same collection of demos), but it couldn't have been recorded
any earlier than 1972, nor later than 1976. IED leans toward
1973-5, but for no good reason.

 4. _Hammer_Horror_. The second of the four demo tracks.

 5. _Feeling_Like_a_Waltz_. The third of the four demo tracks.
N.B.: The bootleggers mistitled this song _Like_A_Rose_Growing_Old_
(the full, correct phrase being "like a waltz, growing old.")
Of course, only Kate knows what the true titles of this song and of
no. 6 are, since they have never been officially released.

 6. _Keeping_Me_Waiting_. The fourth of the four demo tracks.

 7. The "incidental music" from The Tour of Life. This consists
of about eight little bits of low-fi sound, taken from the
London Palladium bootleg recording of the complete Tour of Life
concert programme. It includes three brief prose readings by John
Carder Bush, an odd ethnic chant by the KT Bush Band, and several
musical interludes, all of which were heard in between the songs.

 8. _Egypt_ (live). From the London Palladium bootleg. An early
version of the song, with an arrangement very different from the
LP version.

 9. _I_Don't_Remember_. A live duet of Peter Gabriel's song,
performed by Kate and Peter with the KT Bush Band, dating from
the May 12, 1979 concert organized by Kate for the benefit of
Bill Duffield, a lighting engineer who was killed prior to
the opening of the Tour of Life. (Sound quality is typically
miserable.)

10. _Let_It_Be_. From the Bill Duffield concert, with Kate, Gabriel
and Steve Harley trading vocals.

11. _The_Empty_Bullring_. The b-side of the _Breathing_single.

12. _Ran_Tan_Waltz_. The b-side of the _Babooshka_ single.

SIDE B:
^^^^^^^

13. _December_Will_Be_Magic_Again_. The a-side of a Christmas single,
released in December 1980.

14. _Warm_and_Soothing_. The b-side of the Christmas single.

15. _Lord_of_the_Reedy_River_. The b-side of the _Sat_In_Your_Lap_
single. The song was originally written by Donovan.

16. _Dreamtime_. The b-side of the single _The_Dreaming_. It is
an instrumental mix of _The_Dreaming_, otherwise the same as the
album version except for an extended ending.

17. _Ne_T'enfuis_pas_. The b-side of the _There_Goes_a_Tenner_
single. This song by Kate, sung in French, was later slightly
re-mixed (but not extended) for use as the a-side of a single for
the French and Canadian markets. (Only the first of these mixes is
included in this collection, however.)

18. _Under_the_Ivy_. The b-side of the _Running_Up_That_Hill_ single.

19. _The_Burning_Bridge_. The b-side of the _Cloudbusting_ single.

20. _My_Lagan_Love_. A traditional melody with new lyrics by John
Carder Bush, this was the second b-side of the _Cloudbusting_ 12".

21. _The_Handsome_Cabin_Boy_. Another traditional song, this time with
traditional lyrics, this was the b-side of the _Hounds_of_Love_ single.

22. _Not_This_Time_. The b-side of the single _The_Big_Sky_.

23. _Be_Kind_to_My_Mistakes_. The title-sequence song from the Nicholas
Roeg film _Castaway_.

24. _Another_Day_. A duet by Kate and Peter Gabriel of a Roy Harper
song, performed on Kate's Christmas television special, December 1979.
