   AAARRRGGGHHH!!! Yikes, people, how many of you are there out
there??
   Here's the third and latest section of the list. Thank GOD IED set
a deadline date. THAT DEADLINE IS ABSOLUTE AND DEFINITE! IED hopes you
understand. Anyone asking for inclusion in the list after Sunday
midnight will be REFUSED!
     Sorry to sound cruel, folks, but this damn list is taking up
ALL IED's time these days, and it's now highly problematic whether
the tape will actually get copied 72 times (and counting) for all
you people. God knows IED can't do it. He was hoping that Bob
Thaden and John Bankert would confirm their offers to use their
multiple dubbing equipment to make the copies, but he hasn't heard
from either of them since they first posted their offers (at which time
the total number of applicants was only about twenty). And IED
certainly can't blame them if they feel like pulling out, or
at least reducing their commitment.
     So anyway, there are no guarantees. Meanwhile, disregard
IED's suggestion of yesterday that the "first half" (the first
25 or so people) should send to Bob and the second "half" to
John, since those proportions are now totally obsolete. As of
now, HOLD onto your blank cassettes until the deadline has
passed on Sunday night, and we can all start to figure out how
many of you really want this cassette, and who's going to copy it.
     It may be that we will have to follow our pseudo-moderator's
(|&gt;oug's) advice and pay for a professional duping service to
make a zillion copies for us--which would entail some CASH OUTLAY
from every applicant. We'll just have to wait and see.
     Just answer one question for IED, will you folks? What are we
going to do next month when/if a second demos-EP comes out??? You're
not--you're not going to (gulp!) ask IED for copies, are you?
     Staggered by the extent of his naivete,

-- Andrew Marvick
   P.S.: As to the request for information about Kerry Juby's _The_Whole_
Story_ biography and addresses of _Homeground_ and Intergalactic G.,
PLEASE people--when IED posts this stuff, READ IT and SAVE IT. He has
listed Homeground's and IG's addresses (and many others), and reviewed
the Juby book ad nauseum in Love-Hounds (in fact he is presently
under implied threat of a lawsuit from the publishers--a fact of which
he is not a little proud!). When this damn tape business is finally
behind him, IED will try to put together a "basic fan information"
package for posting in Love-Hounds--ONCE AND FOR ALL, hopefully.
Until then, please be patient.
