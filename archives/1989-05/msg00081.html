 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: Post-final-list announcement and update

     Naturally a bunch more people requested copies _after_ the
deadline had passed. Some of them had posting-dates preceding the
official deadline, and must have been delayed in transit. Theoretically,
therefore, those people's orders shouldn't be rejected, since their
tardiness wasn't their fault. In the real world, however, life is
filled with such injustices, and IED is sorely afraid that all the
latecomers--whatever their excuses--must suffer. This must be
especially frustrating to those who have been e-mailing IED
unsuccessfully since well before the deadline, but who for whatever
reason were unsuccessful in reaching him. For all this IED apologizes.
     However! After all, exclusion from IED's "master" list
certainly does not mean the end of all hope. After all, more than
100 names were posted in the final list, and IED reproduced
at least one form of e-mail address for every one of those
names. What's to prevent the late parties from making requests for
dubs-of-dubs from those more fortunate than they? It's not as
though the "high fidelity" of IED's "master" will somehow be
disastrously corrupted in its transference through a third
generation. And anyway, presumably the main virtue of the tape is
its musical content, not its sound quality. So make an e-mail
friend for life--set up a trade of some kind with one of the
tape-recipients. Surely several will be agreeable to making one copy
for another Love-Hound. But PLEASE--don't ask the original group of
duplicators for another copy. They already have done far more than
anyone could expect of them. Seek out a new person on the list.
It's really not difficult to do, you know. IED apologizes
     Once again, IED apologizes abjectly both for the errors he committed
and for his present heartlessness, but he has received
many complaints recently from non-tape-seeking Love-Hounds about
this silly business taking up everyone's space, time and attention.
He has to agree with them. There are now scores and scores of
avenues which seekers of tapes can pursue toward their goal, without
pleading to IED or to Love-Hounds for copies. He hates to sound
so callous, but this tape business is beginning to get him down--and
after all, it is _not_ a dilemma which anyone really requires
further help from IED to solve.
     He might also add, for the record, that during the past
three weeks or so since he acquired his copy of _The_Cathy_Demos_
_Volume_One_, IED made eight more copies of his 90-minute
tape for non-computerized fans--and this is with only ordinary
one-copy-at-a-time equipment. And frankly, at this point he has had it.
     Also, when the second, third, fourth and possibly fifth volumes
of _The_Cathy_Demos_ make it onto the bootleg market (beginning
"within three or four weeks", IED was told yesterday), this fan will
_not_ be undertaking the role he has assumed in the present case.
     Finally he would just like to say thank you once again to
all of the people who have taken on the responsibility of making
copies for other Love-Hounds: Bob Thaden, John Bankert, Michael
Portuesi, Dan Kozak, Dan T'so, Ranjit Bhatnagar and the others who offered.
IED is beholden to you. Especially John Bankert, who actually _apologized_
yesterday for not being able to accept more than the _fifty-one_
requests he had already accepted! Now _that's_ the Bushian spirit!

   roadside.
