In a previous article, sjw@infonaut.com (Steve Willis) says:

&gt;albums and thinks that Kate has lost something she used to have.
&gt;
&gt;I also noticed in my local cd exchange a box with Kate in some green
&gt;leotard on the cover, called something like Kate the Lionhearted.  Of
&gt;course I had to see what was in the box:  A picture book full of Kate
&gt;glossies and a Lionheart cd.  Cost was $55 US.  What's up with that?

I've wondered about this ever since I bought it, along with a similar
package for _Never Forever_. They're both published by UFO Books, London,
and are nicely produced box sets. Contents:

_Kate Bush: A Lioness at Heart_
	"Lionheart" CD
	LP-sized book of Mankowitz photos
	T-shirt, white, w/ KB "autograph" on front left.
	Fold-open pink-hued "tank-top" poster
	Color postcard of green leotard cover photo


_Kate Bush: Never Forever_
	"Never Forever" CD
	LP-sized book of phots, etc.
	T-shirt, white, w/album title on front left.
	fold-open brown-bordered poster of KB in chain mail w/sun (Delius?)
	Colorful postcard of Kate in red by yellow flowers
	"certificate of authenticity"

Both boxes are self-consciously packaged as "collectibles." First has
shrink-wrap sticker saying "Limited Edition of 1000".  Second had
"certificate" indicating a run of 1500.

Frankly, when I see a certificate like that I feel like I'm getting ripped
off.  It would be the easiest thing in the box to counterfeit!  At any rate,
finding them during the gap between TSW and TRS, I was delighted to pick up
some "fresh" material --at least I hadn't seen a lot of the photos.  

I'm curious what the "word" is on these, too. Seems clear Kate had nothing
to do with their production.  They seem awfully well-constructed for
"bootleg" type materials.  I think I paid a similar price, something over
$50 each.
