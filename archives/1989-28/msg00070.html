 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: MisK.

     Regarding a humor-removing program for Love-Hounds: IED has long
since implemented such a program for his own postings. Wasn't that
obvious?
     Contrary to what Drukman said, IED did _not_ say that "the album"
was "pessimistic". He merely said that the "resolution" (taking care
to put Mr. Sutherland's term in quotes, since IED isn't really sure
yet whether all the songs on _TSW_ _have_ "resolutions" at all) of _some_
of the new songs (and IED specified which at the time, Drukman) did
not seem to be _optimistic_. IED really hates seeing his carefully
composed and judicious statements about Kate's work misunderstood
and then flippantly misrepresented by other, less thoughtful Love-Hounds.
     Drukman's other apparent remonstrance of IED--that IED was wrong
to condemn Sutherland for having read earlier KT interviews--is no
better founded on IED's own remarks. IED _said_ that it was an
understandable way to conduct a KT interview, in that it might help
the flow of conversation and put Kate more at ease. IED merely pointed
out that--whatever positive effects such disingenuous, or duplicitous,
regurgitation of others' ideas might have had on the _MM_ interview--
it seemed to IED to be rather dishonest, or at least a little sneaky,
of Sutherland to spout those ideas as though they were his own, when
in all likelihood he had merely absorbed them from Kate's own earlier
statements in earlier interviews. Efficacious? Yes. Also probably
dishonest, and certainly self-serving.
     Thanks to Michael Hui for notifying Love-Hounds of the imminent
KT piece to be heard on Canadian radio on the 12th. And to Mike
Pritchard for his timely notice re the new Kate Bush video, _Love_and_
_Anger_. (Though right now IED, having as a result of Mike's news
watched--at fast-scanning speed, of course, but still!--some eighteen
hours of "Great White", "Fiona", "Roxette", "Whitesnake" and "Richard
Marx" videos, is not feeling particularly happy about the news that
Kate's work is theoretically to be made accessible through MTV.)
     Thanks also to Neil Calton for the news about the new single.
Great to hear that _Be_Kind_to_My_Mistakes_ will finally become
available on CD--assuming that there will indeed be a CD-single
of the new KT _This_Woman's_Work_ single. Also to hear that the
"12-inch" version will have an additional, exclusive track--though,
again, one wonders whether this track will appear on CD or not.
