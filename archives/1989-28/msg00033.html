Here are some things from the latest issue of _Homeground_:

First of all, from the update included in subscription copies:

"Despite Kate's attempts to keep the album for presentation on the day
of release, 'The Sensual World' seems to have the worst kept secret
since Kim Philby was in MI6.  Copies have been dished out with the
cornflakes to staffers at EMI both in the UK and the US.  [I suppose
they mean CBS here in the US.]  The biggest gaffe came when a whole 
shipment of cassettes was mistakenly packed in cassette boxes labelled
as the new Beach Boys album and sent to record shops in SE London and
Kent.  For a few hours the Beach Boys became a mega-seller in the area
as word quickly got round.  Attempts by EMI to get the cassettes back
met very little success (surprise, surprise!)  Reports from a source in
the 'Our Price' chain tell us that people were coming in and asking to
hear the 'new Beach Boys cassette', and quickly taking it away.  After
these sold out the salespeople were vainly offering the vinyl versions
-- but for some reason these were not acceptable!"

_HG_ says the Canadian telephone number was set up by EMI.

In the regular part of the fanzine, it says:

"Kate has been/is working on the production of two tracks of the next
album by Alan Stivell, the Breton master celtic-harpist. . . .The two
tracks will also have backing vocals by Kate, and many of the other
musicians will be those who have worked with Kate.  John Carder Bush
has been involved in the English translation of the Breton lyrics."
