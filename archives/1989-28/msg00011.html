I realized that this didn't ever get posted here.  The first issue went
out public, subsequent issues are by mailing list only.  Issue #2 is
out as of tonight (if the mailer here doesn't blow chunks).

RELATIVE IMPORTEDNESS
-------- ------------
  I realize that this newsletter will have an international readership.  This
tends to make the issue of imports a bit confusing-- what is an import to
me will be domestic for the people in the UK.  Therefore, I will refer to
all imports as US-import (meaning that it is an import to the US) or
US-domestic (meaning it is a domestic release in the US)-- submissions can
be done the same way (and if you really want to get detailed, put the country
that it was imported from in (), [], or {} after the import/domescit part).

ERASURE
-------
Title:  Drama!         / Drama Remix!
Format: 3" CD w/adapter - slim-line case
Length: 15:02 (3 tracks) / 17:21 (3 tracks)
Tracks: 1:Drama (Act 2) / (Krucial Mix)
        2:Sweet, Sweet Baby (Moo-Moo Mix) / (Medi Mix)
        3:Paradise / (Lost and Found Mix)
Label:  Mute

  These two discs are basically a progression along the lines of the
"Crackers International" discs (there were three).  Not as thoughful in
lyrics or as musical as The Innocents.

  If "Crackers Internatiol" and Depeche Mode's "Personal Jesus/Dangerous" is
any indication of the direction of MUTE records, the US-domestic single
release will contain everything from these two CD singles combined on one
five inch CD with an extra track thrown in.

  Both singles mention "Watch out for the forthcoming album, 'WILD!'"

DEPECHE MODE
------- ----
Title:  "Personal Jesus"/"Dangerous"
Format: 5" CD w/regular jewel box
Length: 40:57 *not bad for a $5 single!*
Tracks: 1:Personal Jesus (7" version)
        2:Personal Jesus (Holier Than Thou Approach)
        3:Dangerous (Hazchemix)
        4:Personal Jesus (Pump Mix)
        5:Personal Jesus (Acoustic)
        6:Dangerous (Sensual Mix)
        7:Personal Jesus (Telephone Stomp)
        8:Dangerous (7" version)
Label:  Mute

  Quite impressive for a single-- 5 versions of one track and 3 versions
of another.  All but one or two of the tracks are available on two UK-import
3" versions similar to the Erasure release.  This is Depeche Mode at their
most pumped up and powerful pure dance-beat type stuff (except the
acoustiv mix of Personal Jesus).

  No mention of a forthcoming album is made.

MARILLION
---------
Title:  "Hooks In You"
Format: 5" CD w/slim-line jewel box
Length: approx. 15:00 *I'm too lazy to check*
Tracks: 1:Hooks In You (Meaty Mix)
        2:Hooks In You (7" mix)
        3:After Me
Label:  EMI
work after Fish left the band.  Steve Hogarth has replaced Fish as
Marillion's lead singer (and lyricist, more or less).

  "Hooks In You" is a rather-dissappointing single-- it isn't nearly as
refined as "Keyleigh", "Incommuinicado", or even "Market Square Heroes".  The
music and lyrics flow much like a Foreignor or old Journey tune (not that
that is bad-- it just isn't the Marillion musical style).  Obviously,
the absence of Fish has affected more than just the lyrics.

  "After Me" definitely hints at the possibility of Marillion still making
quality music.  The lyrics and music are well thought out and well executed.

Title:  _Seasons End_
Format: Standard CD LP
Length: 50+ minutes
Tracks: 1:The King Of Sunset Town
        2:Easter
        3:The Uninvited Guest
        4:Seasons End
        5:Holloway Girl
        6:Berlin
        7:After Me
        8:Hooks In You
        9:The Space...
Label:  EMI

  ...and it isn't as dissapointing as the single.  _Seasons End_ is
definitely no _Misplaced Childhood_, but it really wouldn't be fair to
compare the two.  The album consists mainly of longer tracks w/ lyrics
in the more verbose style than the single.

  The musical style has changed, and the vocals are definitely different;
Hogarth doesn't use the falsetto as much as Fish, nor is he as expressive.
The lyrics are full of imagery and emotion (and well done).

  If this is the base from which Marillion has built to grow from with the
new vocalist, it is a strong one.  It will definitely be interesting to
see where they take it.

  The US-domestic release will probably be available in 4-6 weeks (similar
to the schedule on Thieving Magpie).  I doubt if 'Hooks in You' will ever
be released as a single in the US, though it is possible (depends on the
reaction from radio stations).

The booklet is very nice!  It contains full-lyrics and sharp color pictures
in abstract that allude to the subjects of four of the songs.

KATE BUSH CD single mispressing
---- ---- -- ------ -----------
  I recently picked up the US-import release of Kate Bush's new CD single
"The Sensual World".  I popped it in my player and played it, anxiously
waiting to hear what the record store owner called 'an excellent single; she
has returned to a more experimental sound'.

  Either she has gotten EXTREMELY experimental or I have a mispressing; what
I heard was very high-power pure-dance music (boom-boom-boom) with a male
vocalist.  The disc says Kate Bush, but the contents are definitely not
Kate Bush.

  I suppose I'll keep it as a collector's item-- unless someone really wants
it...

Comment on domestic singles
------- -- -------- -------
  It seems the US domestic marketing types are actually doing things right.
After the initial flood of 3" CD singles that bombed, I would have expected
the US market to drop the concept of a single-- apparently they are trying
again and doing it right!

Examples:
   Depeche Mode-- "Personal Jesus/Dangerous"; A 40 minute single for $5! the
     US-imports would have cost $10/each and even after spending $20 a person
     still doesn't have the equivalent of the US-domestic release.  Not only
     that, but the US-domestic is 5" and the US-imports are 3".

   Erasure-- "Crackers International"; Almost as good as the above.  $8 gets
     the US-domestic EP w/6 tracks.  The US-imports contain only one track
     that isn't available us-domestic (quite a brilliant track at that--
     an excellent version of 'God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen').  But of the
     two us-import version (again, $10/each), one came in a slim-line case
     and the other came in a 3" cardboard slip-cover.
   Cure-- "Love Song"; Domestic is in a full-size jewel box w/an insert.
     US-import is in a slimline with no insert.  "Fascination Street" was
     the same.

...the list goes on with similar examples.

  Definitely a good trend!  Now if the US-domestic releases would only have
as nice of inserts and as many extra tracks as many of the us-imports do.

That's it for now!  This issue wasn't as fat as I promised in the
vol0/iss0 teaser.  But at least it exists.  The next issue WILL be
fatter and WILL be out in the next week or two (my girlfriend is coming
for a visit-- not like I will be getting a lot done then :-&gt;).

Mail any suggestions to &lt;wb1j+CD.Chatter@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;

And please submit-- this issue didn't contain a known bug list or problems
list-- it will be in the next one.

Preview (possible) of next issue (part of it):

New Tears for Fears
Front 242 limited discogrphy (submissions please)
Kate Bush single review (assuming I can get a real one)
Erasure Cdiscography

and more...
