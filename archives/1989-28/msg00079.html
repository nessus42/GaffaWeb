SUBJECT: Playlist                                                     

	Good question about changing the playlist on the album.  I 
did, but not the order.  I would never change KB's order.  (I see 
that fan usage requires KT or the even more distracting KaTe.  
I've been writing KB for years and like the feel of how it types 
better.  Besides, Kate Bush is not a logo.  And I for one don't 
think there IS any TK on TSW, at least not on the Columbia U. S. 
releases.  I have the vinyl and CD, and have looked all the places 
I've been told.

	I found this album yo be like a mountain, and ran up it in 
stages.  I got the single, CD, 12", and 7", at the Record Stop in 
Ronkonkoma the Tuesday before the full moon, and played it all 
week in constant rotation in the car.  Saturday night Oct. 14, 
moon full, I got the album, and after one listen I started just 
doing a two-song set, "The Sensual World" and "Love and Anger."  
Then I would take the first three, the first five.  Even though it 
was a CD, you could feel that "Heads We're Dancing" completes a 
side, and DU starts a second.  The next week I started doing 
alternate five-song sets--1,2,3,6,9 was especially strong, I felt. 
I filled in to 1,2,3,4,5,6,9.  Even when I started picking up on 8 
and, last of all, 7, I still stopped at 9.  How can you go on?  
Beside, I had been listening to 10 for years already, since the 
release of the movie soundtrack album.  And 11 isn't really on the 
album.  It is positioned like "Under the Ivy," as the rare B-side 
of the single.  But then it appears immediately as a tease toward 
the cassette or CD--a new move by Kate.  Notice that now the 
vinyl, without WSDTM!, becomes the collector's item.


	On the consternation over "Reaching Out":  First time I 
heard this, I could see we had to make a choice, whether to go 
with this song.  It helped me when I saw that the last name on the 
first line of the "thank you" credits was "Melanie."  This is 
probably some monstrous fabrication of my ignorance (Melanie in 
the KB circle probably being well known to the informed), but I 
was put in mind of Melanie--the Melanie of "Lay Down, Lay Down 
(Candles in the Rain)," from late 60s/early 70s, and later of 
"Brand New Key."  Both hers and Kate's songs are what somebody 
called 'anthems', girlhearted to a nearly unbearable degree, but 
both songs move me to affirmation.   Rolling Stone  gave "Lay 
Down" the worst, most negative and hostile review I had seen in 
months and months.  I couldn't listen to it myself till much 
later, after Melanie had buffered it with the strong album 
"Stoneground Words."

	"Reaching Out" is needed setup for "Heads".  How sweet it 
is after "Reaching Out" to get that kickoff into "Heads"... but 
then, ambiguity.  We need to bring in "Experiment IV" here and 
Kate's strong awareness of the ambiguous power of pop music.  Of 
her own music.


	Look, is everybody sure that the lines after DU start out 
"I hate to leave you"?  The last line "I hate to lose you" is 
plain enough, but before that I have been hearing "I hate to leave 
NOW" all these weeks, and I STILL do.
