&gt;&gt; Unless Bryan Dongray or Mr. Wentz object,
&gt;&gt; I am adding an audio link to my KateWorlds
&gt;&gt; page to let people listen to Bryan's
&gt;&gt; fine midi renditions of kate's songs
&gt;&gt; as they cruise the VRML worlds.

&gt;No problem with me, what a great idea. Do you have all the
&gt;available (as far as I can find) MIDIs though? 

Great!  I added them on Friday (ok, I guessed you would
not mind) and I'm getting some fantastic feedback.  Folks 
love watching the worlds orbit while the midi plays.   

Do you want your name BIGGER?  ;-)  

Thanks a million, Bryan.  The
midi really dresses up the site a lot.

&gt;You should have:
     
        December Will Be Magic
        Under Ice
        Wuthering Heights

Not these.  I will get them though and add
them.  The world opens with Babooshka because
the beat worked well with the animation.  The
user can load the others and change as they
like.  This lets them go to each VRML world
and change the music as they do.

I will change the Other Kate Page links to _top
targets so they will load in full screen.  Jon
pointed this out to me last night.  Originally,
my thought was to let folks read pages like
the Garden in one frame as the animation, et
al worked in the others.  I may leave that
one in the frame since it is text and works
well.  Some of the others are also framed,
so I need to go full screen.  What I had in 
mind was to get a tighter entwinement of
the various Kate pages so people entering
at any point can easily find the others.
Unfortunately, folks seem to be hesitant
to add all of the other Kate page links to
their own.  Thank God for yahoo and altavista.

&gt; I used wavs of Kate, but they are just
&gt; TOO DAMM BIG for the web.

&gt;I know. But you really need a good soundcard (ie one with a wavetable)
&gt;to hear MIDIs in any reasonable fashion, computer generated instruments
&gt;are often a bit awkward, and if many MIDI channels are used, there can be
&gt;loss of some tracks by the converter. True MIDI soundcards are excellent.

True.  The Turtle Beach cards are below $150 now, so that will
improve.  I have to replace my SoundBlaster because it has
no midi ports which I need if I want to use my own compositions.
OTH, using the CDROMs works well.  I built a page on
Friday as an experiment that loaded a video avi in one
window, the animation in another, and text in the third
with a midi option.  All in all, we could make quite a
CDROM for the LoveHounds if the costs could be covered.
Don't know how to do that, and redistributing Kate's vids
like that would be illegal, no doubt.  We could create
a CD based on the LoveHound's tapes though.  Might
be quite an undertaking.  Hopefully, somewhere along
the way, Kate will discover that this is an exciting
media and get into it herself.  I can imagine some
really stunning stuff for the Common Ground track.
I will probably use that as the background when I
give the keynote address at the Information Technologies
conference in Seattle.  We can burn a rom at work
for the show (no distribution... it would get pirated.)
But I have been invited to show the KateWorlds and
that advances the agenda (KATE OVER AMERICA) another step.

Put her name in everything, folks.  We win by little steps,
and if we can't get her in the front door by honest
means, we will use more familiar tactics. :-)

Thanks again.  The midi is a real hit!
