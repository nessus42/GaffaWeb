&gt;Thanks, Sean for keeping us up-dated on Irish reviews/reations
&gt;to Common Ground.  I was shocked to actually find a copy here
&gt;in Country-Western land (northern Arizona), filed under Rock
&gt;at our local chain store (Hastings).  I'm enjoying most of it
&gt;(Costello, Spillane&amp;Lunny, and Liam O Maonlai and Kate's the
&gt;best but you knew I'd agree with that).  Some of it's kind of
&gt;boring--almost Muzak w/pipes (shannon).  I liked Sinead, too.

&gt;I think my favorite besides Kate is Cathain by Liam O Maonlai,
&gt;which includes masterful use of a didgeridoo (spelling?
&gt;ya know, that Australian item).  Does anybody know anything
&gt;about this artist?

&gt;cheers,
&gt;Kelley
 
You're not going to believe this Kelley, but I actually bumped into 
Liam O Maonlai a few weeks ago in a coffee shop in Dublin with his 
georgeous 3 month old son Cian . I complimented him on Cathain and 
he rather humbly asserted that the whole album was excellent . I 
asked him if it was a traditional tune and he told me that it was a 
song a friend of his wrote on Sandymount beach here in Dublin.
I also congratulated him on his current TV series on RTE television 
called Sin E E which explores the healing aspects of Irish traditional 
music ......... It's a great show .
Liam is a very famous person in Ireland as he is the lead singer with 
a band called The Hot House Flowers who have been very successful 
even outside of Ireland ....... check out their albums People, Home and 
Songs From The Rain .I might add that Liam is one of the nicest, most 
talented people you could hope to meet (after Kate !).
I totally agree with you about his song, it is my second favourite !

SEAN : )
