&gt;&gt;  I personally could live on oysters and Madame Cliquot's fine products.
&gt;&gt;  Karen

&gt; What? No music?  :)
&gt; TSB

Well, since one cannot generally afford Veuve Cliquot one must live by music 
alone.  What is it that Hiro has in his sig?  If music be the food of love then 
eat the music.  I do.


Len on persistence:  I must agree. Every successful writer or artist I've talked 
to says their career hinges on persistence.  A woman I talked with about five 
years ago told me she had studied creative writing with a group of other 
students who were far more talented than she, but her plays are being produced, 
her screenplays for sitcoms are getting produced, largely due to her 
persistence.  She said nearly every one of the more talented people she worked 
with in school had given up writing.  According to the American Society of 
Poets, the average writer (this average includes megamillionaires Anne Rice and 
Stephen King) makes $5,000. per year at writing. Poets make nothing.  But are 
there successful poets and writers?  Yes.  I imagine the situation may be very 
similar for musicians.  

Karaoke: I heard rumors a couple of years ago that a guy was turning up at The 
Mint and doing &lt;very good&gt; Kate Bush karaoke, complete with costumes.  I kept 
meaning to get over there and find out who the heck he was, but never did. 
Perhaps he lurks here, on this very bulletin board.  Anyone willing to come 
forward?

Later, Karen  kln@a.crl.com
