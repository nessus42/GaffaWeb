INTERIM REPORT 3: 
Demo Lyrics (considering Bryan's contributions.) 

*******************************
WE NEED FRESH, NEW LISTENERS!!!
*******************************

First of all a revelation!
About the two Babooshka's! Everything has been revealed LONG AGO! See
Homeground No. 2!
:-)
A review of the radio program is given in which KaTe explains the
development of certain songs, e.g. Babooshka. 
Here are the lines in question:

uncanny how she
reminds him of his fiancee.  [We got that right lately!]

uncanny how she
can take him back into a piece of past. 

Bryan, you were very near!! A very slurred 'p'. 


Bryan wrote recently : (I only comment on things where I disagree)

Frightened Eyes: 
&gt; In any English country garden. 
&gt; although, it could be "At", but it's a hard one, but "In" makes 
&gt; more sense, so my vote goes that way. 

As one cannot decide between "In" and "At" from sound and "In" makes more
sense, I prefer "In". 

It Hurts Me: 
&gt; I was firey but you put me out. 

It's def. fiery!

&gt; If you laughed at me, I'd laugh too. 
&gt; Waltz, don't you know that I'd be really breaking in. 
&gt; I'm 100% on the first two lines, thanks for the "in" at the end of line
&gt; two, YES  you're right. I also hear "une" rather than "un". 

You're wrong: It's NOT "breaking IN" it's: "breakii-hing" a lengthy
breaking, but def. NOT "breaking IN"! Also it's "un"! At least it SOUNDS
like "un". 

Rare Flower:

&gt; OK, now the fun line: 
&gt; It's calling me. 
&gt; With a menacing whisper, 
&gt; Magic opera charming me. 
&gt; is what I hear, seriously, the word "opera" became clear after a 
&gt; few listenings. Perhaps, it's the genuine pig of a CD I have. 

No. I can't follow you here. Difficult lines, but "opera"? Hmm, hmmm..
No, I think, your second line is wrong. Also, the first line is followed by
"of" or so:
With a menacing whisper of..
Magical world enchanting me.

This could also be (from sound):
Would I've ever see him whisper of
Magic of hurt enchanting me. 

or something like that, but I can't hear "opera". 

Rinfy the Gypsy: 

&gt; OK, in the line: 
&gt; (Ooh, a very, long, long ...) 
&gt; I CANNOT hear the word "time" that everyone seems to be able to.

Nobody CAN hear that, I think, it's only a guess, like
Ooh..long, long, long t(ime)
You can hear only a &lt;sound&gt; here, so this might be "time". It can be
anything else or nothing, of course!

&gt; Later, I'm certain it's: 
&gt; Don't cry, you weird little stranger. 
&gt; if I pause after weird, and then play it, I can hear the word 
&gt; "little" quite clearly. 

THIS IS "WEIRDO" and NOTHING else! "Little": Never!!!

Scare Me Silly
&gt; Second verse: 
&gt; Singing amid the cans 
&gt; or is it "Swinging", that's a toughy. I think "Singing" makes 
&gt; more logical sense, but poeticly it could be swinging, but in 
&gt; the UK that refers to spouse swapping, etc, I don't think Kate 
&gt;would have said that! 

Swimming is a third alternative!

&gt; Later, I hear: 
&gt; It's like a film - such balance. 
&gt; I close my eyes to the cello solo, 
&gt; And ache the music. 
&gt; Will never let me blow away. 
&gt; thanks for the clues, I sort of hear "ache" with an "m", but not really,
&gt; ie "make the music". 

I very clearly hear "An-eightnic music" but don't know, what this MEANS!!


The Craft of Love: 
&gt; I have a revelation, the line: 
&gt; Soul burns, and I don't care. 
&gt; I discovered it sounds like: 
&gt; Say a words in our dark hair. 
&gt; not sure DEFINITELY 
&gt; The 'ar' of 'dark' is NOT "don't", the accent would be 
&gt; all wrong for Kate, if anything she'd say "don't" more 
&gt; like "dough-n't" (ie dough as in uncooked bread). 

Very good to stirr this one up! It's yet another 'uncertain' line! 
I can't really hear "Say words". Think-listen-think-listen...
Finally... I would say it's "Sobers" (=become serious, sedate..)
But with an "s"? It sobers? Hmm...
then: "in our/and I dark hair"
The "don't"-accent argument is a strong one. I agree. 

&gt; Later: 
&gt; Jittering strangers with smutting hands, 
&gt; although "smutty" would seem more reasonable, but it just 
&gt; doesn't sound like it! 

I hear "smutting" too. Can it mean festering or so?


The Gay Farewell: 

&gt; but on the second line I actually hear: 
&gt; But listen to the tired your story? 
&gt; once it was described this way, but I can hear the word "tired". 
&gt; Votes? I vote "But listen to the tired old story". 

Very good suggestion, fits very good, can you explain to me what his "tired
old story" is? Unrequited love stories?


Where Are the Lionhearts: 
&gt; Another revelation (well not really), how about: 
&gt; I see she's seen the long days and knights. 
&gt; as in "knights of the round table". It makes a good 
&gt; play on words, something Kate would do, I'm sure. 

I hear only "night" or "knight" without "s"! Unfortunately you cannot
decide between "night" and "knight". You need her lyric sheet. 

(I have it but I don't use it!)


While Davy Dozed: 
&gt; That problem line to me sounds like: 
&gt; The walls to steam 
&gt; With the crack in a moment 
&gt; As I held you. 
&gt; which possibly makes sense (sort of), using the echo/reverb 
&gt; you can easily make out the 't' in moment, but if "steam" 
&gt; was "steep" as suggested, it would have come out heavily due 
&gt; to the heavy echo that's there, I think? 

Relatively clear is:
The wall(s) to #####
with a/the crack ########
So far I prefer Violet's version:
The wall's to steep
with a crack in the moment
as I held you. 

&gt; Later change your "realised" to "realise", 

I slightly prefer "Realized". 


Rolf wrote:
&gt; btw, do you think Kate likes Dali? with all the burning giraffes? ;-) 

Yes definitely: - one moment... here:

Q: DO YOU ENJOY MODERN ART, AND IF SO, WHO IS YOUR FAVOURITE ARTIST? 
A: Salvador Dali. 
(1984, KBC 17, the "Kate singing into a microphone" issue, p. 22)


**********************************
These demos show without the slightest doubt, that God Incarnate is living
among us! Anyone who is less than absolutely convinced of this is a bloody
idiot.

Best wishes
Wieland

"You want my reply?
 What was the question?"
