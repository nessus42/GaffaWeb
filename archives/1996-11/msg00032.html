I fell in love with her music around about 1980.  I first heard Babooshka 
and feel it was a good single.  But when I returned to it monthes later, 
I became obssessed with her work.  I started backwards on her music and 
ended up listening to "The Kick Inside",  then went forwards until I 
reached her Dreaming, which took me forever to get used to and 
appreciated.  Then came "THL" which I adored for it's melodies, lyrics, 
mythology and imagery.  Then came "TSW"...not quite as appealing, then 
came "TRS" interesting, perhaps mainstream pop-although it seems to have 
lost that which I think is her strength and the Secret to the appeal of 
her music-
	  Her piano playing, and unaccompanied singing, as well as her 
references to Celtic lore, and witchcraft.  She is a most unique artist 
, and yes since her first album, she has always been very attractive.  
But perhaps, lately her music is becoming to addorned-and too mainstream, 
it seems to have lost that special quality early in her career which made 
it so universal and aurally pleasing.

P.S.  Listen to Tori Amos's new album "Boys for Pele" and check out track 
number 7- "Caught a Lite Sneeze"-she sounds identical to an early Kate Bush!
It's most haunting.  Although Tori doesn't have the "mystical" woman 
quality as our beloved Ms.Bush...

See-ya!
