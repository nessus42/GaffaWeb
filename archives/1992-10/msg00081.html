&gt;... In Musician magazine a year or two back, they had
&gt;an article on her, and there was a picture that looked like she was standing on
&gt;a stage, singing to an audience (Dave Gilmour was in the picture too, but
&gt;everything else was black, so it was just the two of them, nothing else in this
&gt;photo). She had a microphone, and it looked like a live performance to me, but
&gt;in the same article, she said that she hates touring because she's too
&gt;exhausted after recording. So what's the story?

Sounds like a shot from The Secret Policeman's Third Ball, a charity gig
at which she performed Running up that Hill with Dave, Stuart Elliot and
a couple of others I don't know. April 1987, her second-last live
performance. (as somebody mentioned here just the other day)

&gt;and "The Kick Inside" are cassettes, so everything is condensed. Is the `KT'
&gt;big enough to find on the cassettes, or should I look at a friend's CDs to look
&gt;for them? 

I don't think you'll find it on the TKI cassette (or CD). You see, it
wasn't on the front....(easy enough to find on the LP tho)

&gt;Also, is this on any of her videos or singles (esp. "Aspects of the
&gt;Sensual World," a great investment for anybody who doesn't already have it), or
&gt;is it just on albums?

Just albums.


&gt;  4) WHY IS KATE BUSH SO DAMN GORGEOUS!?

Beacause she's God, that's why. Everybody knows that.
