Hello everyone.

Thoughts on Prince


Recently, there has been some commentary regarding Kate's supposed collaboration
with Prince (or whatever you want to call him).  First, I apologize for posting 
after the thread appears complete, but I've been out of town and without e-mail 
access.  I think there are a couple things to bear in mind. It has been my 
experience that Kate has always given due credit to the people she has worked 
with.  Not just in liner notes, but in KBC magazines as well.  She also takes 
great effort to control her compositions and recordings as much as possible - 
they all bear her mark, regardless of where she may draw influence from. So I 
think it unlikely that she would let go in this instance. Lastly, because of 
Prince's prominence in the music world, people might assume he had more 
participation than he actually did.  If Rolf Harris were famous (beyond certain 
circles) how many songs on the Dreaming would people suppose he co-wrote.  

That being said, "Why Should I Love You" is my least favorite song on TRS, if 
not my least favorite Kate song ever.  I would happily replace it with "You Want
Alchemy". 


Thoughts on Other Collaberators

A lot of fuss has been made over Prince's and Clapton's involvements with TRS, 
but I wanted to put in a good word for Jeff Beck, whose guitar playing, IMHO 
dances all over Clapton's mad combines with the Trio Bulgarka's voices very 
well.  Particularly, I wanted to talk about Gary Brooker, whose fine keyboard 
playing provide a subtle textural groundwork for the songs he plays on. 

See ya,
