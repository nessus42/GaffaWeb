&gt;Musically it oozes along and is quite forgettable.  Lyrically, it seems 
&gt;to be just a "been there, sung that" compendium of phrases and images 
&gt;we've seen in Kate's songs before.  And she does some things with her
&gt;voice in this track that *really* worry me.  Like that spine-crawling
&gt;throat-searing supersonic screech reminiscent of the "what am I gonna
&gt;DO" line from "Constellation Of The Heart"... really, that can't be
&gt;very good for the larynx, and it makes me cringe.
 
Maybe I'm projecting a lot into this song's lyrics that was never
intended by Kate, but on first listen, my interpretation sunk in
and I found myself deeply moved.  I'm not sure I can do justice to 
the depths I find in it, but I'll try to hit the high points, as
I see them.
	Kate sings about meeting a beekeeper, who launches into his awe, his
reverence, his love for bees, which she first responds to with "Is
he some kind of nut, or what?"  She doesn't get it, this fascination
with bees.  But it's not just bees.  Everyone has something they feel
passionate about.  Most people keep it private, or throw themselves into
something mundane like sports or pop music.  Nobody treats sports 
enthusiasts as nuts (at least, not typically), but if you go on and
on about bees, or Egyptian hieroglyphs, or comic books, or anything
unconventional, an eyebrow will be raised, at the least.
	These people often tend to be misfits, loners, often hurt at the
way that people respond (or do not respond) to their passions.  But
in this song, Kate seems to take a tender step into this man's private
world, to open herself and feel and respect this lonely man's joys.
She approaches with sympathy, and for a brief moment, she can share
his vision, and see the alchemy.
	Wouldn't it be great if we could all do that: try to see
the world and its pleasures as do the beekeepers and everyone else in
the vastness of humanity?  Discover how to take joy in all the things
you've never bothered to think about or develop interest it?  Or at least
to try to help the lonely, the misunderstood, and to give them the
rare opportunity to share their passions with someone else?
