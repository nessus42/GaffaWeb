=====================================================================
=======
Changes for Audio Freeware, V1.1, June 2,  1994 - 
   
   The response to this offer has been overwhelming.  I have to limit
the number of mailings to an amount of postage my paycheck can handle
so please, bear with me.  Expect 8 weeks or more for delivery.  Send
postage, and I'll mail it out the same week.
        I have added one more inducement to help me cover costs.
        I am running low on CD's, but have plenty of tapes left. 
PLEASE, specify if you will
take a tape, if no CD's are available.
        I have also added more description to the song list, and a
couple of
paragraphs in answer to questions about what 'kind' of music this is.

=====================================================================
=======

                        A U D I O   F R E E W A R E - V1.1

        Okay, here's the story.  I'll keep it as short as I can.

        Send me your name and address, and I'll send you a copy of my
album,
"Bittersweet".  No strings, no charge.  Specify either tape, or CD.  
I'm running low on CD's, so PLEASE let me know if you will accept a
tape if a CD is 
unavailable.
        One copy per person, while supplies last.

        My address is:

Mail: Paul Henry                          
      Box 231582                        
      Encinitas, CA 92023           

        OR

E-mail: paulhenrys (America On Line)
        paulhenrys@aol.com (Internet)

        Compensation.  What ever you like.  Here are some
suggestions:
        1.  Do nothing.  Enjoy the music, or play CD frisbee.
        2.  Send postage, with packaging, it works out to
            about $1.32 for the tape, $1.72 for the CD.
        3.  Any amount to help me fund my next album.
        4.  Write me a letter.  What you liked, or didn't.
        5.  Pass the music around.
        6.  Ask a record store to carry it.
        7.  Ask a radio station to play it.
        8.  Use the tape to record some music you REALLY like.
                
        If you send money, and I've run out of tapes/CD's, I'll send
it back.
If I receive a request by analog mail, with ANY amounts of money that
seem
generous to me,I'll include a booklet of lyrics.

       T H E   A L B U M  -  " B I T T E R S W E E T "  

The Songs:

1. Galileo - He never had a good protest song.  Here's one, in jazz,
yet.

2. a rose is never wrong - A great physicist once said: "Nature
does."

3. Beethoven's Back - The kind of song Chuck Berry might write if he
                      bumped into Stephen King and they both closed
the bar.
4. Turning into an Animal - I tell people that this is about my cat.
                                           I'm lying.
5. a house of strangers - Most love songs are about the peaks and
valleys.
                                       This one's about the flat
spots. 
6. the Movie:    A jazz-inspired tryptich of what turns out to be, 
                       essentially, a bad date.
        -walking from paradise
        -the man is dancing
        -between the shadows
7. Bittersweet -  A lullaby.
8. Make no mistake - Like it says...

        T H E   M U S I C I A N S 

        Dan Campbell     -      percussion
        Chris Conner     -      bass
        Deane Digiacomo  -      flute
        Steve Feierabend -      sax
        Paul Henry       -      guitar, vocals
        Trisha Mitchell  -      oboe
        Tom Mylett       -      bass on "between the shadows"
        Jim Sweeney      -      drums

What "kind" of album is it? Well, you can see by the lineup above
that the
instrumentation is all acoustic.  These are songs, words and music. 
The
style ranges from contemporary folk to jazz/broadway standard, 
with a quick stop at unplugged rock and roll.

My musical influences include Chuck Berry, Stan Rogers, Stephen
Sondheim, 
Nick Drake, John Martyn, Bill Evans(the pianist, not the bass
player), 
Harold Arlen, Johnny Mercer, Joni Mitchell, XTC, Tom Ross, Chris
Reed, 
Bill Bumpus, Richard Thompson, among others.
