*Sigh* If you wanna get something done 'round here, you gotta do it
yourself.  THEREFORE:

Since all Lovehounds Shirt talk has seemed to have vanished, yet when
I brought it up about a week ago, some folks said "Hey, that's a good idea"
then it was dropped again.

Well.... A friend of who runs a graphic design firm just started the T-shirt
business, too, and would give me shirts pretty much at cost.

Unfortunately, the lowest run he can do to make it worth anyone's while is
4 dozen (48, for the math-impaired), and at such a low run, a shirt with
text on the front &amp; back, with black &amp; white picture on the front would be
about $15.00 a pop.

I'll be rather generous and assume one lurker for everyone who actually
EMails, so unless I get at least 15-20 folks emailing me personally,
I won't even bother.  DO NOT POST TO LOVEHOUND/R.M.GAFFA DIRECTLY!  Yeah,
I'll see it, but it will annoy everyone else.

(Assuming I *DO* get 20 Emails saying "Yeah, I want a shirt", the next
step is I'll post something saying "The Shirt business is ON!", giving
you my address to mail your checks (or cheques, for you Anglophiles).
Unless I get a couple dozen checks, I still won't even start a run -
It's easy enough to say "Yeah, I want a shirt", but I'm NOT going to eat
a couple dozen Lovehounds shirts!  (In that case, I'll return your checks,
uncashed, of course)  Of course, if I DON'T get enough response, then
I'll just post something publicly saying "The shirts are off!" or something
to that effect.  But I think it would be way keen to wear 'em to your
next Katemas party!
