&gt; 
&gt; do you have an opinion about Cathy's demo song? Which one you think is
&gt; the greatest, almost as great as songs of her album.
&gt; I put a new topic here because for many days, we don't have any new
&gt; topic, everyday is just thesame : left-hand drive, six degree of Kevin
&gt; Bacon, Love-hound digest......
&gt; Anyway, thank you very much, bye

Glad to see new threads show up...or old ones revisited. HOWEVER, I just
finished reading 2 dozen digest newsletters leftover from before the
start of the holidays. I was SO VERY GLAD that there short and
interesting topics to read. If the digests were long (i.e. 20-30 entries
each), I would not have been able to read them all. Until I saw the Jack
Nicholson-A Few Good Men connection, I would not have believed you could
get from Kate to Kevin in 3 steps! Is this "for real" or am i missing a
joke?


&gt; Subject: Alan Parsons
&gt; 
&gt; In autumn 1996 Alan Parsons made a guest appearance in Viva II's show
&gt;  [sorry, snip] ...His introduction for Wuthering Heights:
&gt; 
&gt; "Back in the early days of the Alan Parsons Project I remember
&gt; David Gilmour from Pink Floyd walking in with a young lass
&gt; who can't have been more than about 16 or 17 years old at that
&gt; time. Her name was Katie Bush, as she was referred to then, and
&gt; she was about to make an album with another colleague of mine,
&gt; Andrew Powell, who over the years has done the orchestral
&gt; arrangements for the Alan Parsons Project albums.
&gt; And he played me her first album when it was finished, back at
&gt; my house, must have been the late 70s I suppose. And I heard
&gt; this next song and said, "you've got a smash on your hands",
&gt; and of course it was true. And it launched the career of Kate
&gt; Bush: Wuthering Heights."

ONE Hero introduces another!!!!!
