<PRE>
Sunday night 5 Love-Hounds from across the US got together on IRC #gaffa and spent a really nice 
90 minutes discussing Kate and her music.  Since then, I've received a couple of e-mails from 
people who found out about it too late to participate. Everyone seemed to have a good time, and 
although nothing earth shattering came from it, it was very cool talking to people who already 
know about someone I truly admire.  I'm sure that as we get to know one another better, the dialog 
will become more animated and insightful.  HOL, k8_fan, Ciera (from the land of Gooberville music) 
and comfynumb, I hope you will all be back, and I hope that some other Love-Hounds will become a 
part of the group.

Unless someone has a better time, I recommend that we meet Sunday at 9:00 pm central on #gaffa.  I 
hope that this can become a regular gathering, and that people from other parts of the world will 
get a chance to join us (hey - who needs sleep anyway?).  Kate and her music have touched so many 
of us on so many levels.  It is amazing to finally have the opportunity to meet others that 
understand.
