Can I die now?  Why can't I die now?  Please let me die now!

I just saw Skinny Puppy.  They weren't as bad as Wicinski would have
you believe.  Their music was first rate industrial death rock, and
they projected behind them a collection of some of the most grissly
stuff I've seen: people being crucified, giant zits being lanced, rats
running in circles, planes crashing, dead bodies everywhere, dead
bodies everywhere, dead bodies everywhere, skeltons marching,
eyeballs, dogs howling, etc.  The lead singer did look kind of stupid
pretending to have epileptic fits and always tripping over his
equipment and falling flat on his face.

Opening for Skinny Puppy was Severed Heads, and it turns out that
Severed Heads is a tape machine.  I got there late and only saw the
last ten minutes.  95% of the music was on tape and the vocals were on
tape.  There were two guys: one stood at a Mirage keyboard and fumbled
with diskettes.  Every now and then he'd play the keyboard with one
finger.  The other guy twiddled knobs that seemed to control a video
projector.  The images projected onto the screen were very neat.  The
music was very good.  But somehow I expected more.

Today is the one year anniversary of me meeting Kate.
