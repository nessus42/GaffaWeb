Regarding Suzanne Vega...

&gt; [Shelli:] ...did any of you psuedo-Bostonians check it out?  I
&gt; wanted to go but never managed to get tickets, which is probably a
&gt; good thing since they were $11.50 and $13.50 and I *did* bounce my
&gt; rent check this month...

Someone who lives in Watertown is calling me a pseudo-Bostonian?

I went.  She was just as wonderful as the last time I saw her, though
her band was kinda dorky looking.  I guess she must like this band
better, however, because she didn't say anything nasty about them.
Last time I saw her, she insulted the band several times.  Her
previous band looked more like a rock band, and this one looked like a
Berklee fusion band.  They sounded like one too, but it was still
good.

She performed many songs which aren't on her album.  Her next album is
due out in April she said.  She held question and answer sessions
inbetween songs.  Someone asked her if she ever met the soldier in
"The Queen and the Soldier" and she looked puzzled for a moment and
then said "Uh... they're fictional characters.  It's a story.  They
don't really exist."  For an encore, she performed "Knight's Move"
solo and did "Tom's Diner" a capella.

I hear she has a new single out over the water called "Gypsy".  I
haven't seen it yet, however.

Opening for Suzanne Vega was Devon Square: two guys and a chick.  One
guy just sang.  The other one sang and played acoustic guitar.  The
chick did most of the singing and on occasion played an electric
violin.  She had a pretty decent voice.  Some of their music was
silly, some of it was shmaltzy, and some of it was pretty decent.
Nothing to wet your undies over, though.

Other bands I have seen in the past week and a half: The Givens, Robyn
Hitchcock, The Queers, The Ramones, Love and Rockets, Shriekback, The
Beachmasters, Moose and the Mudbugs, and The Prime Movers.  All of
them were quite worth seeing.  I had a fun time slam dancing
sandwiched inbetween two very cute girls at the Ramones concert.
Suzanne Vega was the best of the lot, even if I had to put up with
sitting in an audience full of Yuppies.  I'd tell y'all more about
them all, but it's off to see Fountainhead, which goes on stage in
five minutes.
