I remembered seeing a thing about "Controlled Bleeding" in LH at some point,
and when I happened by their LP "Body Samples", I picked it up. I like!
Can anyone tell me more about these dudes?

After hearing lots of of stuff about Severed Heads and Big Black, I finally
picked both albums up. Severed Heads are fun. Big Black are like Wicinski;
they think they're just sooo fuckin' cool, y'know?, and the attitude just
RUINS whatever they have to say. Still, fun stuff, especially "Bad Houses"
and "Bazooka Joe".

Could people PLEASE shut th' fuck up about Sue? Sheesh. We all have skeletons
in our closet. She likes wimpy guitar pop; I have my "Go West" records; Wi-
cinski has some unmentionable disease that makes him froth at the mouth at
people.

&gt; There's no such thing as "good" new music.

I bet you don't beleive in the tooth fairy, either! Gimme a fucking break.

Between Wicinski's vomiting and IED's fanatacism, is there ANYONE who has
an open mind?

SHRIEKBACK / The Buddy System
Blue Wall, Amherst MA  Last Friday night

Small. Tiny. Maybe 200 people. Less. Not too hot, temperature wise, and
room to dance. The Buddy System, a Boston band, came on and did interesting
things that sounded a little repetetive, but it was pleasant. Pop with
loud overtones. Did about 10 or so songs, ended with a pretty decent cover
of "Baby You're a Rich Man" by the Beatles. 7 out of 10.

Shriekback came on. Opened with "Nemesis", which surprised me. Did a damn
good version of it, too. Did a lot of the new album ("Black Light Trap",
"The Reptiles and I", "Pretty Little Things", "Sticky Jazz", "The Underwater
Boys") and a few from "Oil and Gold" ("Nemesis", "Everything that Rises
Must Converge", "Hammerheads", "This Big Hush", "Faded Flowers"), "All Lined
Up" and "My Spine (is the Bassline)" from "Care", and NOTHING from "Jam
Science". They also did "Feelers" and a cover of "Razor Edge" by Defunkt (sp?).

Andrews looked like he was having fun. Woo was wearing a Turkish outfit that
must have had her sweating like a bastard, and Suh was looking like a Banana-
rama reject. The audience (college wavo trendies, all of us :) ate 'em up.
The energy pouring off the stage was phenomenal. I screamed for "Fish Below
the Ice" and "Accretions" and "Suck", but they didn't play 'em (bastards).
The Blue Wall had to close at 11, so they didn't get to play an encore of
"Nemesis" and one other which I don't remember from the play list. Peter
Lee (FULIGIN@UMASS) interviewed Barry Andrews for a half-hour before the
show, and OF COURSE he'll transcribe it here, WON'T HE? Soo desu ka, Peter-
kun? :-)

If you'll all excuse me, I'm going to be a wavo now and go listen to my
"Don't Give Up" 12"...
