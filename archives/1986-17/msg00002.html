Hi all...been reading this for a while now.  I'm bad with any kind of
mail, and have been putting off a message hear for a while.  Then, I
spent the past month away from anything resembling a computer
terminal.  So, I had a lot to look through, and thought I'd add a
little comment (after the fact) on the topic of production &amp;
over-production.  ("Another World" by the Roches was over-produced.)
As I said, its a comment...no fuel for the debate (may it rest in
peace.)

"... as soon as you get your hands on the production, it becomes your
baby.  That's really exciting for me, because you do everything for
your own child."
"The freedom you feel when you're actually in control of your own
music is fantastic."

      -Kate    (from "the secret history of Kate Bush
                      (&amp; the strange art of Pop)" )

I'm not sure if that quote has been elsewhere.  I believe the time of
the quote was soon after TD was done.

(If TD _is_ over-produced, in light of the above, is it the 'spoiled
brat'?)

If you can't find this book, drop a line, call, or stop in to:

     It's Only Rock 'N' Roll, Inc.
     49 W 8th St.     (between 5th &amp; 6th Ave's)
     NY, NY  10011    (212) 777-7090

They don't have much Kate right now, but they try to get what they
can.  They don't have the 2 (?) older books out...any help in finding
them?  They had a live tape...Paris, '79.  Alas, the sound is _so_
distant, but after hearing the live version of Egypt, it was a nice
find.  (At least unless I find there is a 'real' live version out.)

BTW, what happened to the shirt...I'll take 2.

--&gt; "How do you want to die?"
--&gt;  "With a full bar tab."

                                               --stan
                          [path to be posted here when I figure it out]
