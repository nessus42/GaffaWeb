Robyn Hitchock and the Egyptians/930 club/ Nov 13

Well, this could be classified as trendy college student night.  I got
to this show sooo early cause i had visiting neuroscientists in town
and they wanted to see trend, so I obliged.  By the time the Figures
got on stage I was already comatose.  They did little to wake me
from this coma, and I ended up falling asleep standing up. Being
from Minneapolis does little to make them sound any better.  Their
sound produced a dulling effect on the nervous system of my body,
preventing me leaving.  Kind of like a paralysis set into my muscles
and I was forced to endure their interminably long set.   My
neuroscientist friend comment perfectly describes this band: "Back
in the 60's we used to make drugs to make you feel like this.  Now
they have bands to do it."  During the lengthy break between bands, I
was berated by Cuddlin' Steve Kiviat for my Agitpop review, and he
ordered me to see them when they pass into town next time (kind of
like homework).   I passed the time between sets with my new
hobby: determining the school a person attends by smelling their
armpits. The girl in front of me went to Georgetown, while the guy
over to my right who was falling down smelled like American
University, and so on.   After the feeling of infinity has passed, the
Egyptians showed up to play some music.  Hitchock stuck to playing
more of his older material, which is good since the latest album
sounds too predictable.  No Roger (keyboardist) on this tour, so the
drummer used an octa-pad and faked the keyboards, and it sounded
awful.  The best part about Robyn is the stories which precede his
songs.  This time the stories were long, and still quite humorous,
but he seemed hurried when he told them.  Robyn can still put on a
good show when he wants to, it just seems like we missed it this time. 

I didn't see no tears in his eyes either, so I demanded my money back.
boo hoo.  though i did see peter buck from r.e.m. there, being trendy.
also in a-trend-ance was two people from love and sprockets (was told
names and forgot them) and two people from shreakback (also forgot
names).  You could tell they were english idiots by there pale
complexions.  

can you believe this ?? three whole postings and not one mention of
anything to do with oral gratification of genetilia ?? something's
wrong, i need some psuedo psychologist to tell me whats wrong. 

DH
