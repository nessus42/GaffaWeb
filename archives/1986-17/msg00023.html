Oh Wic, you're a real stoner Springsteen fan - but wasn't Greetings From
Asbury Park "acoustic", too?  Why aren't you flashing that b(l)adge also?

what do you think Brucie was talking about when he wrote:

"Kids flash guitars just like switchblades
 Hustling for the record machine.
 The hungry and the hunted
 explode into Rock And Roll bands
 They face off against each other in the streets"

Is he saying that the hustlers for the record machine face off against
the barbarian garage bands?  Or do they just face against each other
en masse?  Either way in the end, it's all decimation.

Re:  Anglo Popsters

I've noticed a strain of politics running through some of these new pop 
band's music...

I heard Lenin once said something to Gorki about how Beethoveen makes him
feel like stroking his hair and that he'd prefer something that would
rip the head off.  (heh heh)... I guess the Jazz Butcher and the Three
Johns will have to find another hero besides Lenin now since their music
pretty much makes me wanna sleep.  Perhaps Liberace is free for an
audience.

On Controlled Bleeding:  Paul Lemos put together a compilation of
industrial bands for Placebo back in '84 or '85.  Wayside and (I think)
NMDS carry it.  Also, you'll find some more of Lemo's contemps on that
Tellus tape, "Power through Electronic"  (carried by NMDS as well).  Can't say 
from the description that I'd like his new work but I was wanking about his old 
stuff way too long ago for anyone here to remember, I guess.  He also is
found writing reviews for various pubs (including Artitude)

Gee, John, if there's not a dance song on the record, you could always 
program some non-lateral drum beat and mix it on to a tape - from your
description the new stuff sound malleable enough.

p.s. Alfke, just curious, but what do you think of Flock Of Seagulls...
