In answer to recent inquiries privately
addressed to IED by Jeremy, Douglas and
others, don't you think you might be letting
your imaginations get the better of you?

IED sends his sincerest thanks to the Keepers
at the Welling Zoological Gardens for their
generous loan of two prize Kentian giraffes
for an indefinite period to the SSIL*,
an institution presently in his charge.
Personal thanks go to Kate, as well, of course...
What's that, Raf? (Gasp!) Don't be so vulgar!
You're beginning to sound like Wicinski or Hoffman
or someone...That's right, you! Heed the advice of
your well-bred companion... (No, not me. Gi!)
During their stay in the States the
animals will be on display each evening from
7:30:20 to 7:30:30 p.m. only. It is therefore recommended
that all interested parties video-record the
exhibit for later playback in slow motion or
better yet, frame-by-frame advance. Transfering
the audio portion to audio tape for later reverse
play is also strongly advised for those enthusiasts
of hitherto inaudible languages...

nExt, To answer (ssh!) mArK's latest post-(quiet! ow!)-ing,
first of all it'S great to find a love-hound who
actually _liKes_ a record of kate's! second, although
ied agrees that any and all versions of "wuthering
heights" are welcome, he must point out that the new release (the
"new vocal" version) is something on an altogether higher level
than earlier variants, sinCe it represents the
definitive statement by the mature kate, under
OptimaL nineteen-eighty-six studio conditions. the aLterations
to the vOcal line, phrasing, timBre, dynamics and
rhytHm are of incalculable importance tO the
(oh do shut up, raf!) world.

Finally, let IED add that (now she's gone off
to sulk!) IMP (International Music Publishers,
IED believes) have published the sheet music
for "Sat In Your Lap", and if Mark is really desperate,
let him send IED an SAE to receive a photo-copy
of the item in question. Be warned, however,
that, as with all of Kate's music published to
date, the transcription is bare-bones and prone
to error. IED's address: c/o Andrew Marvick,
10499 Wilkins Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90024
(213) 474-5208.

-- IED

Raffles: The silly nit, calling himself
         IED when everybody knows that's not
         his real name...
Giro:    Well, yes, but he's so FIERCELY
         loyal to us, Raf! Anyway, more or less.
Raffles: (Inaudible)...
