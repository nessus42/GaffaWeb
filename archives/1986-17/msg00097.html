Isn't there anyone else out there that thinks that the new version of
"Wuthering Heights" is a total let down?  The great thing about the
original version is the vocals.  The arrangement of the original is
highly flawed (not Kate's fault because she didn't do the arrangements
on her first album).  The obvious thing to do to make a better
"Wuthering Heights" would be to keep the vocals and rerecord the
music, but what did Kate do?  Instead of getting rid of that godawful
guitar, she left the arrangement largely alone and rerecorded the
vocals.

Now, don't get the idea that I think Kate's voice has gotten worse
over the years.  I think that her voice has done nothing but get
better.  But when Kate wrote "Wuthering Heights", she wrote it for how
her voice was then, and she just can't sing like that anymore.  She
just can't wail and whine the way she used to, and as a result, the
new version just doesn't have the power of the original.  Perhaps if
she had sung it in a low, rough voice, it would have been interesting,
but she tries to sing it in that double soprano of old and misses the
note in a couple of places.  Also the soulful voicals at the end are
totally out of place.

P.S.  Did you know that Throwing Muses is touring with the Cocteau
Twins in England?  Is the idea that Throwing Muses shreds your ear
drums, then the Cocteau Twins heal them?  Only, the Cocteau Twins like
to do that at 120 dB.  Hmmm....

P.P.S.  To answer John Rossi about Klaus Schulze, I have *Trancefer*,
which is by far my favourite, *Audentity*, *Dune*, *Cyborg*,
*Timewind*, *Mosaique* by Robert Schroder, and some early Tangerine
Dream albums.
