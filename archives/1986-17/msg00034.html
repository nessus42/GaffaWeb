OK, NOW, YOU GUYS, GET OFF MY TERMINAL!

Jeez...

IED's menagerie of S.I.L. are getting out
of hand, and he apologizes for any damage
they might have been doing recently.
They're being shipped back to Lewisham
Heath next week sometime, as soon as IED
can find a packing company that stocks
shipping crates twenty-two feet high.

Meanwhile, for those diligent students of
the official newsletter (all one of you), the HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT
number turns out to be Kate's birthday. Hardly
a revelation, huh?

So, EMI America, November 14 has come and gone, and
where was the domestic Whole Story, or even a US 12"
of "Experiment IV"? Typical.

(Wouldn't have that sort of incompetence if giraffes were
running the show, eh, Raffo?)

(Too right...)

What can IED say? They tricked him into telling them his password.
At this point he's just thankful they're vegetarians: better
the next-door neighbors' front lawns than IED's already dwindling
supply of hair.

Speaking of giraffes, the New Music Awards were re-broadcast
by USA Network again last night. IED assumes all L-Hs watched,
recorded and studied in slo-mo?

"Experiment IV" is the greatest entity in the history of existence.

   (us, too)
   (too right)
