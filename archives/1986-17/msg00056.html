Finally got hold of a UK pressing of
"The Whole Story". Very interesting
effect it has, the selection and
sequencing of songs from throughout
Kate's career. IED tried to imagine
the impression an uninitiated listener
would receive from this collection,
and decided he/she would get a clear
idea of Kate's stylistic range, but
not a very good sense of the
context in which the style developed.
For one thing, the songs go from
early to late and back again, the
sequence apparently determined by sound
dynamics, so unless the listener studies
the LP notes carefully, he/she is likely
to get a distorted idea of the sounds
that Kate herself designed. But most
confusing of all, IED thinks, would be
the subject matter of the songs. No
lyric sheet is included, so (as most
L-Hs will be able to appreciate) a new
listener couldn't really hope to decipher
more than two thirds or so of the lyrics,
even after prolonged listening. And since
greatest hits packages are designed primarily
for the casual music fan, it seems unlikely
that this compilation will do much to edify
the public about the REASONS for the sounds
within Kate's songs.

The KT symbol is not hidden within the cover
art, but etched into the vinyl. The inside
of the gatefold sleeve is bordered at the top
by four photos: one from Doug's favourite
photo session (the pink leotard shots), one
from the live "James and the Cold Gun",
one from the "Sat In Your Lap" single cover session
(a slightly different shot than the one which
appears on the 7"), and the last from the
1985 Guido Herrera (sp.?) sessions.
Along the bottom of the inside is a long row
of tiny colour photos of "all" of the single covers
(actually, of course, just all of the UK covers), the LPs,
plus The Single File, the live EP, and the three
videos released to date. The back cover features a JCB
sunset silhouette photo of Kate as Peter Reich sitting
at the controls of Ken Hill's cloudbuster.
A video is to be made available to accompany the LP.
