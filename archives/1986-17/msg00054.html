ZZZZ Scraping Foetus off The Wheel: "Nail"
ZZZZ Very good album; orchestrated industrial with raunchy vocals.  Half the 
ZZZZ cuts are mean dance, half are conceptual orchestral work.  Personally
ZZZZ I prefer the latter...

I disagree - this album is a meandering attempt at nothing.  It's a big dull
blank, has no direction and no goals.  Maybe that's why the vapid intelligentsia
lapped it up so hard.  

Now for my plug:

Flipper:  Public Flipper Image LTD. Two records - got it for $8 at a 
cool store and it's $8 dollars through the mail.  Do not, repeat do not
pay more than 9.50.  Mail away for it to Subterranean or NMDS because
even though it's one of my favorite records of the year so far, someone
will be ripping your ass off.  this is a series of live recordings from
Flipper's tours throughout the country.  If you are a Flipper fan, you'll
not be disapointed.  This record puts the ROIR recording to shame.  It's
much more clearer in quality and all that.  Listen to side four first 
(or at the store) if you aren't a Flipper fan or haven't heard of them.
Then make your decision.  It prompted me to call up a local commercial
radio station and ask the mellonhead there to play Flipper instead of his
usual Grateful Dead selection (he plays one dead cut a night).  He said
they hadn't got the record yet (suuuure).  The cover folds out into a 
game board and game cards and such are given as inserts.  Looks like a fun
game as the winner gets all the money in the end.

Got a whole bunch of new records none of which caught my ear like this one.
Beats Springstone as a live album tenfold.

Rapidly Expanding Other Stuff (hofdork's constupor guide):

Minimal Man: Sex w/God (too jazzy, plodding).(C)

Stevie Wonder:  Songs in the Key of Life (great to wash dishes to) (c+)

Regressive Aid LP:  Strange that these guys joined Black Flag instead of Gone.
	Stilla rockah a la Jeff Beck/Jan Hammer colabs. (C+)

Akido: untitled from NMDS.  Real lo-budgie, the album is spray painted
	directly and the title is stenciled.  The music hearkens to Lydia 
	Lunch's 13.13 with an updated focus on industromatics.  I'm yawning 
	just thinking of  it but will give it another try. (D)

Minuteflag - 4 song 45 12" - out of the blue this comes crashing furiously
	like some bad Grateful Dead cover band at a lame blotter party.  The 
	fact that  this is made by members of Minutemen (incl. d. boon) and 
	Black Flag  makes it all the more reprehensible.  I'm guessing this
        wouldn't have seen the light of the laser if not for D. Boon's
        untimely death... (D-)

Poison Idea - Record Collectors are pretentious Assholes.  Okay this is old,
         from back in '84.  Great front cover of Tom Roberts records (hey, he 
	 has some SKREWDRIVER!).  Still doesn't measure up to their latest
	release but has some high points above and beyond the call of
	hardcore.  Funny, these groups usually get worse after their
	first self-done releases.   ( B- )


Coitus - This is Rossi's tape available from him.  Tangerine Dream fans
	should note it as this is about the closest I can come in 
	comparison.  Makes good background music at work (except for
	the freebase song which caused el bossman to flex his eyebrows).
	I'd deal with Rossi for this pretty tape if you are a well-rounded
	type ... (no rating - I got this for free).

:wq

Well, I'll brief you as further developments occur...
