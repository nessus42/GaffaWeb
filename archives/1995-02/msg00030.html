Richard Hamilton &lt;74557.664@CompuServe.COM&gt; asks...

&gt;What is Lindsay Kemp's character? I thought perhaps he was the 
&gt;devil, but I kinda doubt it.

Lindsay Kemp plays the character which gives Kate the clues she needs to
"sing back the symbols."  I remember a while back someone using the phase
"...helps Kate."  On one level I agree.  He does tell her what she needs to
know...along with Lily.  But doesn't he seem a bit devious?  When I first saw
his grin whilst "Kate's" legs were swooshing about I thought for sure that he
was the bad guy. (I have not seen the Red Shoes, so I'm only going on what
I've seen in TL,TC&amp;TC.)  As the film progressed I learned that he was helping
out, but that initial perception still stayed.  Has anyone else felt the same
way?  Also, I've seen some mention of Lily ("...she's good/she's bad" to
simplify) here and there in R.M.G.  I'm still confused.  Can someone give me
a synopsis of their real-life relationship?  (No great detail, please.)

As for R.M.G, it gets a bit hot in here sometimes, but certainly nothing
unusual.  We've all got our own opinons.  Conflict is part of life, whether
we like it or not.  I guess that I'd rather look at it as a way of getting me
to think more about a subject.  Sure I'm a newcomer, but some flames aren't
going to scare me away from the best source of  Kate info around!

Anyway, I wanted a big T-H-A-N-K Y-O-U to go out to those involved in both
the Suspended-T-Shirt and the Lovehounds Collection projects.  She's so
c-u-t-e in RocketMan.  And I swear, that Night Flight interview was difficult
to watch.  You could really see Kate's expression change every time that
idiot interviewer screwed up.  I felt so bad for Kate.  She seems like such a
bright and imaginative person, and all that interviewer did was shut her
down.  (I kept going "ask her about that...ask her about that..." to no
avail.  I guess my psychic energy isn't enough to change something that's
happened years ago...hehehehe.)
