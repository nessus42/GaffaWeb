Hi all,

Some time ago (on 2 Dec 1994...) IED wrote:
 
&gt; IED has a question for you:  you say you saw Kate perform
&gt; "Wuthering Heights" on TopPop "a couple of times".  Can you
&gt; remember whether these were two different performances, or the
&gt; same one broadcast twice?  Also, do you remember whether Kate
&gt; was wearing a plain long dark dress or a kind of floral print? 

Well, I've been digging in my memory, in my 'archives', and in
Marcel's video collection (Hi Marcel! :) ), and here's what I
could find: some pretty useless facts about "Wuthering Heights"
in the Netherlands, 1978. :-)

I found some playlists for the most played records on the
national rock-radiostation in a week: 
     week from 19 - 25 Feb '78: WH is nr. 28 with  7 times;
     week from 26 Feb - 4 Mar : WH is nr.  3 with 16 times.
And then they stopped publishing this list for the time being.
And I have to admit that I made a mistake in my previous post -
I can't have heard "Wuthering Heights" in January, it must have
been February 1978. Oh well.

On to the charts. In those days there were two charts; one was
the 'Nationale Hitparade', and the other one was 'de nederlandse
top 40' (which also had a 'Tipparade').

In the 'top 40' "Wuthering Heights" was in the 'Tipparade' on 4
March 1978 for one week at nr. 11, and from 11 March 1978 it was
in the 'top 40' for 11 weeks, at the following chart positions:
     26 - 10 - 5 - 5 - 4 - 4 - 8 - 10 - 15 - 24 - 38.

The 'Nationale Hitparade' had a Tip-elpee, and on 4 March 1978
that was "The Kick Inside". WH was in this chart from 25 March
1978, and the history in this chart is as follows:
      6 - 5 - 3 - 6 - 8 - 8 - 19 - 26.

And now the important bit. :)  The 'Nationale Hitparade' was the
one that TopPop used, and according to my listings they showed
"Wuthering Heights" twice. I seem to recall having seen it more
often than that - must have been the Efteling special and stuff
like that.

The first time on TopPop was the 25 March chart with Kate as new
entry at nr. 6, the second time was the 8 April chart with Kate
at nr. 3. 

I think there were two different recordings. I have this image
in my head of Kate dancing on grass, and at one point bending
backwards until she's standing on hands and feet. Less than a
second I think, but that image stuck with me for ever since. From
what I've read in the FAQ and seen from other video's and
everything this could have been the Rockflix video - could it?
Does anybody know? I would really love to see this one again...

The other appearance was with Kate in the TopPop studio. Here she
wore a long black dress, with black or grey lace or something.
There were two images, Kate's face close up, singing, in front,
the left half of the screen, and Kate dancing, small in the back
in the upper right corner of the screen. The dancing is quite
similar to some other versions I've seen, the setting is similar
to for example the video in the white dress (with the two Kates).

I think this was the second time, as I remember I was a bit
disappointed - I really liked the dancing on the grass, and would
have loved to see that one again.

Oh well, I think that's all I've got. Hope you can use some of
this. :-)

Best wishes,

Marion
