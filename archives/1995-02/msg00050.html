&gt; As for those who say LH is dominated by a close-kit family, I disagree.
&gt; The names that were cited are those who post a lot and/or possess a
&gt; huge amount of Kate lore, and that is the only "kinship" that is apparent.
&gt; It is true that newbies (Kate-wise or Net-wise) can be intimated by the
&gt; tone of some of their postings.  But I am sure their intent is not to
&gt; exclude newcomers.  Unfortunately personalities are as different as snow 
&gt; flakes, and some people tend to stir up friction a lot; in the case
&gt; of LoveHounds there just seems to be a larger than normal proportion
&gt; of them!

I've been monitoring this newsgroup since I first heard of it 2 years
ago...
Even though I've been a fan of Kate's music since 1978, I had alot of
questions about Kate and her music.  I remember posting several times
asking
some of those questions...only to be COMPLETELY ignored by the
"family".  Of
course, the "family" members were discussing whatever..and probably
everyone
though that someone else would answer...That wasn't the case.  I was
pretty
left on my own to try and find the answers to my questions by reading 
"THE GARDEN" and "CLOUDBUSTING" documents (both excellent, BTW)  

So now, If I do see a post from a newbie, I try to answer...i can't
answer to 
ALL of the questions (most of the "family" know WAY MORE than i do) 
but at
least I try.

....this is why I feel the Lovehounds are a hard to penetrate.  It
seems that
more often than not, the newbie are ignored.   I feel that it's the
DUTY of
the "family" to inform all of us about Kate and her music....regardless
of
how many times someone may ask the same question...
ie.   question: "When is she going to tour ?"  
 ....may I.....     
      answer: "Probably never.  She hasn't toured since 1979.  She has
               made a few "guest" appearances here and there.  You may
               want to check out the bootleg CD "This Woman's Live
Work". 
               A single CD pretty much covers ALL of her live
appearances
               from 1978 to 1987 excluding her own tour in 1979."
...um...was that a decent answer?....;-)

anyways, I've rambled long enough...

What we need is a new album!...Mmmmmmmmmm YES!!!!!....that'll get all
of us
back on track!

Peace

ron
