Mark at AOL asks:
&gt;I finally was able to get a copy of TLTC&amp;TC this last week and enjoyed it
&gt;quite a lot. I missed the NightFlight interview, tho I wish I had known
&gt;about it so I could have seen it.

   Oh, the Night Flight interview didn't air on TV (and won't on the
mis-begotton tripe that passes for the current incarnation of
Night Flight) recently. The copy that everyone is talking about
is on the Love-Hounds TapeTree videotape. This is a 4-hour collection
of rare Kate video assembled and distributed by an ad hoc group
of Hounds. There were ~12 master tape distributers in the US, Canada
the UK and Aus. There are at least 350 very high quality dubs.
The original dubbing project was followed by a Fall clean-up
distribution. There won't be another official distribution until
the next tape is ready for next Katemas.

   But not to worry. Each one of the dub copies is more than good enough
to make futher copies. Remember: The TapeTree tape is copyleft. Possess-
ion of a copy obligates the owner to make additional copies for
anyone who asks. Just ask, and someone will offer to make you a copy.

&gt;Currently, on Video, in Portland, one Video rental store has Live from
&gt;Hammersmith Odeon?, Sensual World, TLTC&amp;TC, The Whole Story and The Single
&gt;File.  What other videos are floating around out there? I'd really like a
&gt;chance to see whatever else might be available.

   That's it for officially released video in the US. The store must
have a major Kate fan working there. (ASK! I met my mate of 13 years
via a record store employee mentioning "Hey, there's this other Kate
Bush Fan." You might not need a soul-mate, but might meet some really
interesting people.) The official stuff is dwarfed by all the unofficial
stuff, and it will eventually appear on TapeTree tapes. Sorry that
the process isn't faster, but as it's a negative-profit, labor-intensive
job, we can't really ask everyone involved to do it much more than
once a year.
