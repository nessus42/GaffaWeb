If a little control of one's feelings, supressing of one's ego and

Of cource not, but IMO it's inpoliteness towards Kate to hammer down 
others' opinions.

I for one have always opposed closed circles...it has some very damaging 
aspects to rational menatl activity. The growth of selfcontentness is one 
of the problems of these closed circles.

The word 'newbie' as such is as offensive as: nigger, fascist, spokesman, 
faggot, etc...it is impolite to give people lables. On the other hand I 
wouldn't want the terminology to go as far as in the States with all the 
looong terms such as 'physically impaired'. It's just that 'newbie' is 
such a unnecessary word...how long does one have to be in this group to 
not be a 'newbie' or how long has one have had to listen to Kate to not be a 
'newbie'? 

Anyways, I don't know very much about Lovehounds and as such haven't got 
enough knowledge to judge them...I can only say that talking to Vickie, I 
have found out that she at least isn't the monster she has been tagged.
If the Lovehounds known to be loud and pressuring in their opinions, why 
not re-christen them...Love does not condemn, nor does it judge.
