Hello
        I've always been a bit of a lurker and just have a few things to say...

        a) if anyone could inform me via mail how I could maybe get one of the
videos that are floating around (pref. the new one with the night flight
interview) I'd be most appreciative...

        b)it seems that lately every list and what-not that I'm on is having
controversies about "cabals" and "cliques" and "flamewars."  Half the reason
LoveHounds is refered to as cultish is because of the closeness, passions, and
(maybe in some cases), even high-self-opinions.  Part of the reason new people
come on board is to learn new information and communicate with
similarly-oriented people on subjects they all share and love.  Personally I
think people on Tori's RDT have been terrible lately when it comes to being
"Cultish" and overanalyzing on subjects (as we tear through the meaning of "Me
and a Gun" for the billionth time).  That overanalyzing of the most obscure
parts of the subject's work is also what helps to scare people off.
        I admit I've always been fairly afraid to post here because of the
closeness of the community because I feel a tad intrusive.
        I'm here because Kate Bush IS one of my favorite artists, the one who I
discovered when I was first getting into music, and the one who dragged me into
the sun and away from the radio...  But I feel, as do many others, that I could
be flamed to high heaven if I should ask something that reveals my ignorance.
        I don't know much, same as a lot of "Newbies" or whatever we should
call them/ourselves this week...  that's why I'm here.

        The few times I have posted questions, everyone has been so nice, and
WONDERFULLY receptive and helpful, that I am actually going to risk publishing
this...

        Why not just try to be receptive to everyone's opinion, whether they be
new or one of the "Core Clique/Cabal" since I don't think anyone wants the new
readers to run away screaming in terror.

        I hope everyone gets what I want to say as I don't want to offend
ANYONE with this... I just think we must all try and be a tad more relaxed and
remember that this is a list to all bring us closer to other fans of something
that gives us all A LOT of joy and pleasure.

        PLEASE DON'T FLAME THIS...
