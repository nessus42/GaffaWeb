&gt;As for R.M.G, it gets a bit hot in here sometimes, but certainly nothing
&gt;unusual.  We've all got our own opinons.  Conflict is part of life, whether
&gt;we like it or not.  I guess that I'd rather look at it as a way of getting me
&gt;to think more about a subject.  Sure I'm a newcomer, but some flames aren't
&gt;going to scare me away from the best source of  Kate info around!

   Thanks for the rational viewpoint. (For those interested, this is my
*first* response since my original post suggesting that perhaps planning
a project was best done in a seperate mailing list, my reasons why such
artistic project was doomed to failure, and my reasons for believing
that Kate would not have a positive reaction to the proposed project.) 

&gt;Anyway, I wanted a big T-H-A-N-K Y-O-U to go out to those involved in both
&gt;the Suspended-T-Shirt and the Lovehounds Collection projects.  She's so
&gt;c-u-t-e in RocketMan.  And I swear, that Night Flight interview was difficult
&gt;to watch.  You could really see Kate's expression change every time that
&gt;idiot interviewer screwed up.  I felt so bad for Kate.  She seems like such a
&gt;bright and imaginative person, and all that interviewer did was shut her
&gt;down.  (I kept going "ask her about that...ask her about that..." to no
&gt;avail.  I guess my psychic energy isn't enough to change something that's
&gt;happened years ago...hehehehe.)  

   On behalf of the entire TapeTree video crew, you are welcome.

   As difficult as it is to watch, it was even more painful in person.
We were "lucky" enough to be sitting on a couch in the control room
during the interview. Vickie and myself, Mike Weaver and a fellow Kate
Fan from Virgina and John Reimers were all biting our lips and sitting
on our collective hands to avoid running into the studio and throttling
the dippy "interviewer." This is as close as I have ever seen Kate get
to anger. 

   The saga of the Night Flight interview is a pretty good example of
the Bush Family view on publicity and privacy. Cynthia Friedland, the
producer of Night Flight sent John Reimers her 3/4" "window dub"
videotape. Naturally we were interested in getting a copy. John
Reimers had developed a friendship with Kate's brother John Carder
Bush. For some reason not clear to me, John felt compelled to ask
JCB if it was ok to make a copy of this tape for us. JCB responded
in the classic Bush Family manner "well, we would prefer that you
didn't." It wasn't until later, when a non-window dub (but much
lower quality) version showed up on tape trading lists that we were
able to get a copy for distribution.


                          Chris Williams of
                             Chris'n'Vickie of Chicago
                               chrisw@fciad2.bsd.uchicago.edu (his)
