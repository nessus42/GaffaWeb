Hi all,

    I just got from my latest trip to Sydney where I picked up the CD single by
Kate's Project 'Wuthering Eight'. What a scream, dance mix Wuthering Height!
:-)

    On another point, I got my latest ICE mag (#77, the August 93 issue) anyway
they have the following artical!! ...

KATE BUSH/STEVIE NICKS: No, they're not recording together, but these two rock
divas have separate new albums scheduled for mid-September release. Penciled in
first, on September 7, is Stevie Nicks' new 'Street Angel'. ... [stuff about
Stevie deleted to keep this a KaTe review]

    Presently slated  to arrive a week later, on September 14 from Columbia,
Kate Bush's new 'The Red Shoes' album is being called her most accessable,
commercial album to date by all who have heard it. On board to help out are
guest luminaries Eric Clapton, Prince, Jeff Beck and David Gilmore, generally
appearing on one track apiece. The albums 12 original compositions were
recorded primarily at Bush's home studio, making it a self-produced effort,
with strings and bass reportedly overdubbed at Abbey Road studios in London.

    "It's more commercial than anything I've heard Kate do," says one insider
who's heard the album. "There are certainly two - if not more - top ten singles
on it, certainly for the U.K., and that's based on a few people's opinions."
Another closely involved source tells ICE, "Certainly the two lead cuts, 'Eat
The Music' and 'Rubberband Girl,' are as accessible as anything she's done in
... well, maybe forever."

    The complete track listing for 'THe Red Shoes' consists of: "Rubberband
Girl," "And So Is Love," "Eat The Music," "Moments Of Pleasure," "The Song Of
Solomon," "Lilly," "The Red Shoes," "Top Of The City," "Constellation Of The
Heart," "Why Should I Love You?" and "You're The One." The first single planned
is "Eat The Music," with the CD single also containing a remix of the song plus
another track. The cover of 'The Red Shoes' depicts, appropriately, ballet
shoes up on points, hand-tinted red, with a "stormy background" behind them.
Bush is also working on what's being called a "movie" in support of the album.
