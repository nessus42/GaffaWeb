I just got Homeground no. 48 (Summer '93) in my mailbox today.  This
is the first time in quite a while that I got my issue before I 
saw it in Tower Records.

The only problem with having Peter FitzGerald-Morris contributing
to love-hounds is that now there's very little news in Homeground
that hasn't already been mentioned here!  But there are a couple
of items:

A little more detail about the cover:  It "features a sepia photographic
montage of wild seas and Kate's feet wearing the said red ballet shoes,
within a circle on a black background."

"The album was first presented to Kate and Del to the top EMI staffers
at Abbey Road on 20th May.  [That long ago! -- Ed]  Del went to the
USA in mid-May to present the album to Sony/Columbia."

The choreography of the film is by Lindsey Kemp.

"Sony/Columbia are reported to be extremely enthusiastic about the
album.  They apparently considered very carefully both 'Rubberband
Girl' and 'Eat the Music' for the first US single before falling
into line with the latter."  As Peter just posted, this seems
to be the case, although the first single in the UK will be R.G.

"Paddy Bush album on the way?"

"UK progressive band Galahad have Kate tribute ('Evaporation') on 
their _Nothing is Written_ album."

"Italian mixers under pseudonym 'Kate's Project' have done a dance
mix of 'Wuthering Heights.'"

"Another interview disc has appeared in New York.  Entitled _Just
Saying It (Could Even Make It Happen)_, the front cover photo is
taken from the 1987 BPI award ceremony showing Kate in the 
high-collared black dress.  The back cover is a photo taken from 
the 1985 Laserium launch party for _Hounds of Love_.  The vinyl
was a mucky purple colour, and the interview is said to date from
1985-86."

Our own Vickie Mapes has an article about "Moments of Pleasure."

For you Happy Rhodes fans, there is part of an interview with H.R.
