In article &lt;234610070893*/I=GR/G=GRAHAM/S=DOMBKINS/OU=BHPMELMSM/O=BHP/PRMD=BHPMEL04/ADMD=TELEMEMO/C=AU/@mhs&gt;,

&gt;Kate Bush's new 'The Red Shoes' album is being called her most accessable,
&gt;commercial album to date by all who have heard it.

&gt;    "It's more commercial than anything I've heard Kate do," says one insider
&gt;who's heard the album. "There are certainly two - if not more - top ten singles
&gt;on it, certainly for the U.K., and that's based on a few people's opinions."
&gt;Another closely involved source tells ICE, "Certainly the two lead cuts, 'Eat
&gt;The Music' and 'Rubberband Girl,' are as accessible as anything she's done in
&gt;.. well, maybe forever."


heretic@zeus.tamu.edu (Evolve or Perish) said...

&gt;Does anyone else find all this talk about the new album's "commercial 
&gt;potential" just a little creepy?

&gt;The tone of these industry newsletters just puts a bad noise in my head. 
&gt;"...most commercial to date...at least two hit singles...most accesible
&gt;work ever..." I can almost see the drool. Sickening.


I have to admit I feel somewhat nervous about these comments...
Only three or four years ago, I was listening to 'popular' radio stations
along with 'everyone else', but I also found that so much of the music
sounded the same...

Then I began to discover radio stations which played 'alternative' music 
(read 'not played on popular radio') and although some of it was just 
plain weird which I couldn't relate to at all, I found other music that
really spoke out to me - listening to the old radio stations afterwards 
made me want to scream as it sounded so awful.

For me, finding KaTe (unfortunately a relatively recent event) was similar 
to finding these 'new' radio stations. It was a wonderful new experience, 
and it is one which I relive every time I listen to her.

The thought of Kate becoming more 'commercial' is worrying. The comment
that "There are certainly two - if not more - top ten single on it" is
especially worrying considering the contents of the top 10 last time I
looked (I don't know how different New Zealand tastes are to the UK - 
I think NZ is closer to the USA in 'our' music tastes)

I hope that my fears are unwarranted... (I expect I'll be buying "The Red 
Shoes" along with the rest of you, regardless... &lt;sigh&gt;)
