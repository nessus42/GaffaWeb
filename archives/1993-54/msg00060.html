Howdy,

I won't add to the presently most popular thread in this news group.
Some folks were interested in news of Tori Amos and I received this
in the mail today from the "Tori Amos Fan Club".  I would assume
they don't mind it being posted, if nothing else it might be
advertising for them.  If any kind soul in Europe would be willing
to arrange getting the European CD's for me, I would gladly offer
a similar favour of getting that kind soul something of equal value
that is only available here, or sending the appropiriate funds in the
appropriate form.  I also apologize for the lack of Kate content.

*********************************************************************


Merry Christmas from Tori &amp; the fan club!

Tori's new album, "Under The Pink" will be released in the United States
and Europe on February 1st, 1994.  The song titles on "Under The Pink" are;
"Pretty Good Year", "God", "Bells for Her", "Past The Mission", "Baker Baker",
"The Wrong Band", "The Waitress", "Cornflake Girl",  "Icicle", "Cloud On My
Tongue", "Space Dog", and "Yes Anastasia".  Complete details on the album
will be featured in the next issue of "Upside Down", which will be mailed
prior to the release of the album.

A four track CD EP titled "God" will be released in the United States around
the end of January or beginning of February.  This time frame is tentative.
Atlantic Records has not set an official pressing date, so you will want to
call your local retailer around  mid January for the official release date.
This CD EP will contain the following tracks; "God" (LP version), "Home On
The Range", "All the Girls Hate Her", and "Over It".

Europe will release 2 CD singles in mid January.  A version of "Cornflake
Girl" backed with "Sister Janet" and "Piano Suite".  The second European
CD single will be released about one week later.  This will be a limited
edition version of "Cornflake Girl" backed with 3 cover songs; "Strangefruit"
by Billie Holiday, "If 6 were 9" by Jimi Hendrix, and "A Case of You" by Joni
Mitchell.

Atlantic Records is planning an extensive promotion campaign for "Under
the Pink" including radio and television broadcasts, and a quick tour in the
USA.  This will be followed by an extensive tour abroad, and then back
through the USA and Canada for full exposure in all major cities.  Tour
dates and locations will (be) listed in "Upside Down".

We did experience one set back.  When the time schedule for Tori to
record the Christmas songs for the fan club came, she was ill and
unable to record them. With the hectic schedule she has going right
now, Tori has not been able to get back in the studio.  As Christmas is
only a few days from now, putting out a Christmas recording became
quite impossible.  Tori and I both feel bad about this and hope you will
understand that it can not be helped.  We are working on something
special for the members of the fan club, in addition to a surprise which
should be ready in time to include with the next issue of "Upside Down".
Until then, Tori, Dawn, and I wish all of you a lovely Christmas, and a
wonderful New Year!

Signed Tom Richards

******************************************************************

In addition, on a little pink postcard from "really deep thoughts",
another Tori fan club, they add:

Tori will once again be touring as a solo pianist.  The tour is
expected to start early in March or April with a few major cities
in the US, a full European tour and then a full US tour.

Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails sings backing volals on "Past
The Mission."  Tori has said that there will be plenty of B-sides
for the singles on this album.
