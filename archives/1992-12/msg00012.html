&gt; has begun.  Everybody I've talked to who has acquired this album has agreed
&gt; that they haven't been able to stop listening to it since they got it, and
&gt; they're not tiring of it at all.  They, myself included, can't really figure
&gt; out why they like it, if they're sure they like it at all.  But the fact
&gt; remains that I myself have listened to it at least 30 times in the two weeks
&gt; since I got it, including four straight times through last Thursday afternoon
&gt; and when it's not on it's going through my head and I wait in anticipation
&gt; until I can get home and put it in the player.  Similar symptoms have been
&gt; reported across the globe.

Of all of the songs on the CD, _Me and a Gun_ is the one that I 
find stays with me constantly.  It's definitely the most painful 
to listen to and is not my favorite song on the album but I just 
can't seem to keep it off my mind.

&gt; I'm not knocking Tori's talent.  In fact, I'm glad to see her opening the
&gt; door for other female artists, be they newcomers or women with long careers
&gt; behind them who have never gotten the recognition they deserved, at least
&gt; in this country (sound like anyone we know and worship?).  But there must
&gt; be magic involved, because otherwise I just can't figure this whole thing
&gt; out.

I'm really glad to see that Tori isn't interested in
comparisons with Kate or any other female artist.  It seemed like
she almost took offense at the suggestion- not because she
doesn't like Kate, but because it's something that is generally
done when discussing female artists.  I tend to describe
my favorite singers in a way that most people can relate to-
and it just happens that Kate and Tori have vaguely similar
styles, so it's easiest to use that comparison.


 Melissa Caldwell                         You want my reply?
