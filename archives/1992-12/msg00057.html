        Scott - Is Carriad Kate any good?  Is the article in Record 
collector any good? 

        Welcome back (temporarily?) to fellow San Diegan Mark T. Ganzer 
(known to me by reputation only). 

        Did I miss it, or what happened with _Rocket_Man_ in Australia?  Did 
it go go number 1, or back down, or.....???

        Brian asked for a review of the boxed set - the general feeling was 
that it was too expensive and didn't contain linear notes for the B-sides 
albums, and many people were disapointed that it didn't contain any 
un-released material. 

        Jude mentions seeing a drawing of Kate on the back of an Amiga 
drawing program.  The program is Spectracolor, and it is included with the 
program, and is used as an example on how to do various functions of the 
program.  The artist is mentioned in the a text file: 

Cheryl Austin is a self-taught artist, whose usual medium is colored pencil. 
Her art appears in galleries in Laguna Beach, CA.  She discovered the 
potential of the Amiga while watching her brother play with a friend's paint 
program.  Her current project is a complete animation of "Kate Bush dancing" 
which is being created in SpectraColor.

        This was about six months ago, and I haven't seen this, but maybe 
after Cloudbusting Amiga comes out she'll see it and send me a copy of her 
project.  :-) 

        A friend of mine just brought over six episodes of one of Kate's 
favorite shows, _Faulty_Towers_.  Does anyone know anything about this, when 
was it on, how many shows were there, why were there so few, etc, etc. 

        I found this old KBC article in the archives.  Somehow it got left 
out of THE GARDEN and Cloudbusting.  I've checked out a couple and the 
interesting thing is that The Stone Book and the others in that series were 
all published around 1978, so Kate must have read them within a year or so 
of writing this article on "Children's books".

 Subject: Kate recommends books to read, ca. 1979 
 
   &lt;Reproduced from the fourth issue of the Kate Bush Club _Newsletter_, 
which came out in late 1979. It's important to bear in mind that at this 
stage the Club was directed mainly toward very young fans--it took a while 
before Kate and her group realized how many older fans there were, 
apparently. Nevertheless, these books, which are all children's books, must 
be at least somewhat representative of the kind of books Kate herself 
enjoyed at that time.&gt; 
 
                             _Books_to_Read_ 
 
   I thought it would be a good idea to recommend some of the books I've 
enjoyed recently. They would be nice to give and to receive as Christmas 
presents. 
   _The_Snowman_, but Raymond Briggs (Hamish Hamilton). A lovely story, told 
entirely in pictures, of a boy's adventures with a snowman who comes to life 
one night. Beautifully drawn, funny and moving. A real delight. 
   _Masquerade_, by Kt Williams (Cape). The riddle book to end all riddle 
books. If you can unravel the clues they will lead you to a golden hare that 
is buried somewhere in Britain. Super illustrations. 
   _The_Stone_Book_, _Tom_Fobble's_Day_, _The_Aimer_Gate_ and _Granny_ 
_Reardun_, all by Alan Garner (Collins). A linked quartet by one of the 
finest living prose writers, though each book is an entity in itself, 
covering eighty years, from 1860 to 1940, in the life of a Cheshire family. 
Each book is only eighty pages long, and a fuller, richer, more exhilarating 
eighty pages would be hard to find. Each story is filled with the mysteries 
and magic of working with stone, wood and metal, and each has a stunning 
set-piece that left me literally breathless--a girl's whilrling ride on a 
church weathercock, a boy's 
climb to the inner tip of a steeple, the thrill of sledging in new snow in 
an air-raid. They are also well made books, with fine etchings by Michael 
Foreman--a delight to hold as well as to read. 
   _The_Haunted_House_ by Jan Pienkowski (Heinemann). Open every page and 
horrific things jump out at you, and there are lots of tabs to pull and push 
and turn to make it more ghoulish. Really good fun. 
   _The_Wind_in_the_Willows_, by Kenneth Grahame, illustrated by Arthur 
Rackham (Methuen). Everyone will know about this classic, but I would like 
to recommend this edition, because it's a good size--it feels like a 
book--and has the superb Rackham illustrations. It's worth having for those 
alone. 
   _Moshi_the_Jackal_, by Tas Gibson (Rex Collings). The life of the Jackal, 
told through the story of Moshi, brilliantly illustrated by one of the 
leading wildlife illustrators. Tas also had a hand in the design of our 
Lionheart logo.    _The_Mouse_and_His_Child_, by Russell Hoban (Faber). A 
brilliant, funny and profound novel following the attempts of a 
father-and-son clockwork toy to achieve self-winding, in the face of attacks 
by Manny Rat, one of the great villains.
