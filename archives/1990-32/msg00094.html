   IED has finally caught up with the volumes of recent postings to
the group, and has one or two very minor KommenTs.
   I liked the story of Ron's visit to Welling. IED has very fond
memories of his own pilgrimage there in 1985. Good job interviewing
the local villagers about their recolleKTions of Kate "way back 
when..."
   Ed's list of "famous" people who've avowed admiration of Kate
should also Mick Karn (whose recent expression of his respect for
Kate's work postdates and presumably supplants earlier, less favourable 
assessments by members of his ex-group Japan--himself included--back  
in 1982, when they jointly asserted that the Japanese singer-
songwriter Akiko Yano did what Kate "tried to do" better than 
she did); and the two Irish musicians Donal Lunny and Liam O'Flynn,
who have worked with Kate on several occasions and who, upon being
asked about the experience by IED a couple of years back, were 
_very_ animated in their praise of her talent and character. 
   If we're going to be real sticklers about the titles of Kate's
two French-language recordings, IED believes the titles should 
read: "Ne T'enfuis pas" (or possibly "Ne T'Enfuis pas") and 
"Un Baiser d'enfant"--NOT "Ne T'Enfuis Pas" or "Un Baiser d'Enfant".
The capitalization of words in French titles is limited to the first
word and/or the first "principal" word--or alternatively, the first
noun or verb. Not, as in English, all words except minor conjunctions,
prepositions, etc. In Kate's defense about the switch from "THE
Infant" to "UN Baiser": Kate's two French friends (who made the
translations of both songs originally) had good reason for changing
the article in this way. "Le Baiser d'enfant" can conceivably be
interpreted in French argot as a gerund rather than a simple noun--and
in such a context "baiser" does _not_ mean a simple "kiss". Although
it would sound awkward to a French native, the phrase "Le baiser
d'un enfant" could sound a bit like "the f***ing of a child". IED
assumes that this was the reason for the changing of "Le baiser"
to "Un baiser", though again it's only a theory; and it's doubtful
that Kate had anything to do with such decisions, relying as she
seems to have done on her friends' translation, and making one 
or two minor errors (which nevertheless go beyond mere
mispronunciation) in her delivery. (The original translations 
have been published in old Newsletters and _KB_Complete_, and they
do not contain those particular errors).
   IED invites responses on these linguistic issues, and stands
ready to be correKTed on his French, which he admits is woefully
imperfeKT.
   A big thankyou to Ron S. Hill for his splendidly generous offer
to make prints available upon request. Sounds to IED as though you
may have made the mistake that alot of fans made (IED included)
when snapping Kate on stage: i.e., using flash. The stage, it 
seems, was plenty brightly lit already, for a reasonably fast
film. The whiting-out of Kate's face was the inevitable result.

-- Andrew Marvick
   P.S.: IED confesses that he cannot place the "poem" which
Ed Suranyi posted, though he knows he must have read it in 
its original location because it sounds very familiar. Wasn't
it a recommendation for a book, Ed? Did it appear in the Newsletter?
