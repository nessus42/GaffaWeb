Love-Hounds-request@GAFFA.MIT.EDU:
&gt; Really-From: ed@das.llnl.gov (Edward Suranyi)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I missed the first article of this thread, but I found it rather
&gt; amusing.  Hope you do too.

Here's the first post in that thread for those who missed it....


| From: CWALTERS@DUCVAX.AUBURN.EDU (The Honky Avenger)
| Newsgroups: rec.music.misc
| Subject: The Death of Jon Drukman
| Message-ID: &lt;9011281441.AA14781@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU&gt;
| Date: 28 Nov 90 13:42:00 GMT
| Sender: daemon@ucbvax.BERKELEY.EDU
| Lines: 35
| 
| Let it all be known that I, just this morning, have strolled over to 
| gaffa.mit.edu, and personally killed Jon Drukman. The words of My Savior
| Murphy have inspired me, and I have begun a jihad against all things
| Drukmanish.
| 
| Shame on you, Jon, for not being born an angry black man!
| 
| I freely confess that I, The Honky Avenger, had once enjoyed "Graceland" on
| its musical merits. I did NOT realize that I was furthering the cause of
| Apartheid when I purchased it, nor did I realize that I was ignoring 
| America's history of racism every time I put on "You Can Call Me Al." I
| beg your forgiveness.
| 
| I have traded in "Graceland" to some bigoted, pale-faced, slave-owner
| descendant and purchased "Nelson Mandela Hums His Favorite Polkas" and
| "Martin Luter King, Jr. - Balls To The Wall" (including the hit single
| "Digital Bitch") and I feel much better.
| 
| I need your help, Lord Murphy, because I still like Jon Anderson better than
| Little Richard or B.B. King, and I would still like Kate Bush to give me
| a hickey. I know that both Anderson and Bush have gotten where they are, not
| on raw talent, but by exploiting black people and ignoring America's history
| (I know neither of them are American, but so what? Bigots are bigots. They
| should have been black.)
| 
| Plus, God help me, I still think Jesse Jackson should go back to being a 
| waiter somewhere. Siberia, maybe.
| 
| By the way, Drukman managed to clone himself before I got there, the bum.
| He'll be back....
| 
| I hate my parents for not being black.

For the humor impaired, please note that this is a joke.  It loses a
bit if you haven't seen Mr. Murphy's remarks on rec.music.misc but
this is pretty good satire.

"Satire?  This is zany madcap humor!"
