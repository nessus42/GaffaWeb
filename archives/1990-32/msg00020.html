&gt;Subject: Whatever happened to. . .?
&gt;Does anybody know what happened to the following love-hounds?
&gt;Several of them used to be quite prolific.
(List of 4 omitted)

How about adding |&gt;oug to that list! What has happened to our humble pseudo
moderator?

&gt;From: nrc@cbema.att.com (Neal R Caldwell, Ii)
&gt;Subject: BucKeT o' Stuff
&gt;I hope that a great deal of consideration goes into choosing the
&gt;venues and means of ticket sales for any tour that might come to pass.
&gt;If some means of allowing the hard core fans to pre-purchase their
&gt;tickets isn't found  scalpers will make a fortune and there are bound
&gt;to be some very distraught Kate fans left outside.  It's too
&gt;frightening to even consider.

Let's hope that at the very least the KBC or Homeground send out
details of the tour dates before they get in the general press and
before tickets go on sale, so that the fans can get to the front of
the line.

&gt;&gt; There were lots of female fans at the Convention. The lack of female
&gt;&gt; UK Lovehounds probably says a lot about the deficiencies of the UK
&gt;&gt; education system and employment opportunities for women.
&gt;
&gt;I had never considered this until you mentioned it.  How odd.  What is
&gt;it about the UK educational system that so discourages women to
&gt;pursue the sort of careers that tend to provide net access.

That is not an easy question to answer. It is something that is often
discussed by those involved in all areas of education. I am no expert
but I expect it has much to do with outdated attitudes that are only slowly
being replaced. Even today you will find a lot of older men (and some women)
who think that a woman's place is in the home and that the man goes out to
work. The late unlamented Prime Minister said something very similar only
a few months ago. This was amazing that the leader of the country could
take this attitude (she was talking about women being with their children
rather than working).

Certainly in the past women have not been encouraged to enter the sciences.
Why this seems to have also been true of computing is even less hard to
understand. It may in part be the viscious circle of companies not
employing many women, so teachers advise their pupils to do other subjects,
so the number available for employment are small etc.


Just a small point about the box sets. Nobody has mentioned the fact that
as the LPs are on 3 discs and the CDs on two, you get an extra photo of
Kate on the sleeve of the third TWW LP.
