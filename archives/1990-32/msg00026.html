A couple of days ago a friend, also a graduate student, came up
to me and said, "I've heard about Kate Bush from you sometimes,
so I decided to check her out.  I got _The Sensual World_ through
the CBS record club, and I like it quite a bit.  I'd like to hear
more."

"You've come to the right person," I thought.

Tonight I brought all the other albums over to his house, as well as
the videos _The Whole Story_ and _The Sensual World_.  He seemed to
be very interested; he asked if he could borrow my albums.  If he 
follows a pattern very familiar to all of us, he'll soon be hooked.
Once Kate has grabbed you, there's no turning back.

Anyway, after I showed him the videos I wanted to demonstrate the
obscurity of some of Kate's lyrics.  What's the perfect song for
that?  "Suspended In Gaffa," of course, especially since it's also
one of my favorites.  So I played the song while he looked at the
lyrics sheet so he could understand the words, at least.  Then I
asked him, "What do you think it's about?"

"I think it's about writing your Ph.D. thesis," he said.  "All
those lines about having your feet stuck in the mud, and going
in slo-mo."

So I told him what Kate has said in interviews, about how it's 
analogous to the Roman Catholic idea of seeing God, but then never
being able to see him again.  "So, it's sort of about reaching for
something that you can never have."

He said, "Yep.  It's about writing your thesis."
