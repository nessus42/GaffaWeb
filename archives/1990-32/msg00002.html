Well, I must have seen you there, Jorn, since I saw C&amp;V at both shows as
well.  I would have to agree that DCD was certainly much more stark and
stunning that CT... although both shows were very good.  The one thing
that bothered me the most about CT was their unconditional reliance on
drum machines and recorded synth tracks.  Most of the recorded drums were
certainly simple enough that a half way talented drummer could play them
live... as for the synth tracks, I dunno.  The 4 guitarists on the stage
(only two of whom seemed to be playing *anything* and at that, it was hard
to tell just what sounds they were making except in rare instances, due
to the volume of the recorded stuff) were rather lifeless and were it not
for Liz' vocals (which were rather low in the "mix") the whole concert 
could have been replaced by a loud playing of their CDs!  Nonetheless,
I did enjoy the show, perhaps because I liked the music and the lights and
the volume and the crowd.  (The sound was ok, considering the poor
venue the riviera is... the vic is much nicer.)
