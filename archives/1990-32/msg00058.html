CD sound quality:

It has already been mentioned that some of the boxed set CD booklets are 
printed on thinner paper than the non-box import CD booklets (LH and TD are 
most noticeable).  Has anyone tried to make a concerted effort to determine if 
there are sound quality differences as well?  I sometimes wonder if I search 
too hard for such differences but I want to make sure I keep the best sounding 
KaTe CDs.  I do not believe that discs of the same album always sound the 
same.  It depends on which company pressed them.  That is why I specialize in 
import discs. If you have any comments please let me know what you have 
deduced or noticed.  I suspect that the box LH and NFE are slighlty inferior 
to my other import pressings.

Prices for the box set:

I have noticed that prices for the boxed set vary all over creation.  Some 
places are probably profiting very little, others a lot.  What bothers me most 
is that the price in Canada is half that in the UK and they are the same sets.  
Did EMI really mean that to happen?  I would like to collate a table of  how 
much people paid or how much you have seen the set for, and at what locations. 
I am not interested in who paid what just what stores are asking for it and 
where the stores are.  If you have posted such info before please could you 
email me with it again (especially those incredible Canadian prices).  I will 
tabulate and post the findings at a later date.  Please send it in the 
following form :
price in your currency,sales tax rate if not included in price, store, city, 
country

e.g. in my own case

$US174.99, 7.25%, CDSounds, San Diego CA, USA
$US199.99, 7.25%, Off the Record, San Diego CA, USA
$US169.99, 7.25%, Lou's Records, Encinitas CA, USA

It would be nice to get info from around the world.  I might write to EMI 
asking why UK and US fans have been stiffed so.


A separate 2 disc release of TWW:

I disagree with Jon Drukman regarding a separate CBS release of the boxed 
set's extra track discs.  I don't think they should do it even if they could 
(don't forget CBS own the rights to only 5 of the 29 tracks).  I am not sure 
they would pay the necessary amount to EMI America/Manhattan to get the rights 
to those rather obscure-to-the-average-American-music-buyer material.  Myself 
I would be very angry if they did appear having bought the full box and 
already owning the import CDs.  Even worse would be a separate EMI release of 
the two discs in the UK.  It would ber such an insult to her fans who have 
already purchased the set.  I would expect EMI to get a lot of VERY angry 
letters if they did.  I would certainly send one.

Please send info you have to offer to me at the address below. Thanks
