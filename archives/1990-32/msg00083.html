Hello everyone!  I am Ronald Hill and I got my computer fixed after 2 months
or so of being broke down.  I first wanted to say hello to everybody I met at
the convention.  For those of you who don't remember my name I was the Blond
Haired,very jet-lagged,backpack tooting,high pitched voic guy from San Diego..
  I was also the guy who gave Del the "I love San Diego" T-shirt to give to
Kate.  
  First off I would like to give a big "thank you" to everybody I met fogiving
me such a good time.  I expected to be there all alone but for the first
couple of days I was with lots of people (which made the days I spent outside
of london seem slightly lonely!!!).  I especially want to tha: 
Jorn Barger - for introducing me to everyone and for giving Peter my backback.
Chris 'n' Vickie of Chicago - since it was because of you that I got to meet
Peter Krystyna and spend a day (and a night as it turn out) at their house and
see all of there stuff..
Richard (???) - I am sorry but I cannot remember your name even though you
told it to me twice!! You were the person who had on the "Black Bart" shirt
and I wanted to thank you for those tapes that you are sending me.  
 
The computer that I am accessing only has 52 messages on it from Love-Hounds
so I missed all the messages from before the 30th of November so I guess I
missed everyones "Con Story".  Here's mine.  But before I tell it I wanted to
again extend the offer to anyone wh was there that wants photos from the
convention I have abo  75 pictures including- 
 
44 pictures of Kate - these were taken from the center about 3 people back
right behind all the rude people who were standing up.  I didn't have a
close-up lens so they aren't close ups but kattakes up the middle third or so
of the pictures.  Her face is "whited out" on about a third since I guess it
was the brighted thing there!  On the rest you can see her face resonably
well.   I also hav pictures of the presenters,the crowd, the performers,
paddy,del, and just about everything that happened!  
I also have my favorite picture there which was of Del after the conntion when
he was talking to a couple of fans.  I asked him if I could get a picture of
him smiling since I didn't have any pictures of him smiling.  That BUSTED him
up and the picture is of him making a happy face at the camera.   I also have
one of him signing autographs.  
  Aside from those I also have pictures around London, Beatle Pictures from
Liverpool, and picture from the place where the Prisoner Television show was
filmed. 
   Oh, and for Jorn I have the picture of you climbing off the stage with your
video in hand and a BIG ASS grin on your face.  I wish I had remembered and
taken a picture of you winning the video, but this is a really good picture.  
   If anybody wants any of these Just tell me what you want and leave your
name/address, etc.  I think I can get pictures at work for about 15 cents each
so as many as you want.  Try to tell me right away as I would like to do them
all together and I seem to have a long delay before my messages get
through....
  
If you want to write me -
