Good going, Ed!  I've got a coupla people hooked right now -- it's just
a matter of reeling them in, as it were.  In my opinion you just can't
have too many LoveHounds!  8-]  

It's funny, but my first reaction to _Suspended in Gaffa_ was "Ah, here's
a relatively straight-forward song."  (The Dreaming was the first KT album
I heard, I and was bit dazed by the time I got to _SiG_...).  Since then, 
however, I've learned that my first, profound, impression of the song's 
meaning differs wildly from anyone elses (Ms. Bush's included), and in
fact _SiG_ may be one of the most evocative of KT's works...  Happily,
the video adds to the effect without in anyway limiting the interpretation.

Any reactions to the Cole Porter/AIDS extravaganza on ABC Saturday?  All in
all, I thought the censorship flap was more interesting than the show
itself.  (It was rumored that the S. O'Connor and Nenah Cherry (sp?) 
videos were to be edited;  I don't know if this happened but ABC _definitely_
avoided mention of the AIDS focus in their promotional spots Saturday -- it
was billed simply as a Cole Porter tribute...)  The one video that really got
me was k.d. langs:  just a happy homemaker until you realize that she's 
disinfecting the house...

Footah!
