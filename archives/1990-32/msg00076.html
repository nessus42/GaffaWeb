My .gaffa path seems to be working again (at least, I saw my complaining
message).  Several people told me that they too are missing some
of the last couple of days.  So I thought I'd repost my two postings
that got lost someplace between gaffa and much of the rest of the world
My apologies to those who have seen them already.


I hope that there are not too many people out there who are
sick of my postings.  I can't help it -- when I'm excited
I like to post.  I've been in a continual state of excitement
since the KonvenTion.

Anyway, I just thought of making a list of famous people who, through
their words or deeds, have indicated that they are Kate fans.  (Of
course, "famous" is not strictly defined.)  I do not include people who
have worked with Kate unless *in addition* they have stated that they
are Kate fans.  I also do not include any of the many critics who have
praised Kate's albums, unless the critic is nationally known.  I currently
don't know of any in that category.  Here's the list:

Sinead O'Connor
Peter Gabriel
Midge Ure (formerly of Ultravox)
Nigel Kennedy
John Hughes
Nicolas Roeg
Suzanne Vega
Dave Gilmour
Pat Benatar
Donny Osmond
Natalie Cole
Ozzy Osbourne
Robert Smith (of the Cure)
Paul Kantner (of Jefferson Airplane)
Simon Le Bon and Nick Rhodes (of Duran Duran)
one of the members of XTC (Andrew Partridge, I think.  Jon Drukman can
	 correct me if I'm wrong.)

I would certainly appreciate comments, objections, questions, and,
especially, additions.  Thanks!
