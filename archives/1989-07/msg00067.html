In article &lt;7933@batcomputer.tn.cornell.edu&gt; you write:
&gt;Really-From: riley@tcgould.tn.cornell.edu (Daniel S. Riley)
&gt;
&gt;I agreed somewhat with IED's and |&gt;oug's comments on the subject, but this
&gt;is the first message in this thread that I absolutely, unreservedly agree
&gt;with.  "total indifference to the idea of limitation" is a wonderful way
&gt;of putting it, and agrees exactly with the impression I get from Kate's
&gt;music.  It also distinguishes between Kate and some of the other artists
&gt;mentioned with a clarity that I think both |&gt;oug's and IED's arguments
&gt;lacked.  But of course, that's just my opinion.  Some familiarity with
&gt;Zen helps.
&gt;

	Of course, this is probably predictable by now, but I feel
that this description even less distinguishes between the work of KB
and that of the other artists metioned (i.e. Mike Oldfield, Tangerine
Dream, Todd Rundgren, and Brian Eno).  By the way, I am 99.9% sure
that all the above artists are well aware of the Zen ideas cited (in
fact they are quoted on some TD albums).

	I think that the problem here is that either one of two
possibilities:

        A) Just like not all KB albums exhibit this feature in the
same way as "The Dreaming", also not all the albums of the above
artists do so.  I know of several acquaintances who have albums of the
above groups, but yet have never heard the ones that I consider to have
the quality we are discussing here.  For example, I would never have
made a point of listening to "The Dreaming", were it not for Doug (or
some other person in the future perhaps).  Almost none of the record
stores and libraries have it at the moment (they all have tHS).

        B) The degree of receptivity to a particular artists'
communication varies greatly among music lovers.  Possibly many of you
miss the "total indifference to the idea of limitation" inherent in
some of the works of the artists listed above because you do not
connect with that particular artist's music.  I'm not talking about
not being a good listener, but rather simply what might be
oversimplified as a "difference in taste".

        I guess I am saying that what should really have been said in
the previous articles is: 

"The Dreaming 
has quality A, which has only been done by a few artists, 
and quality B, which has only been done by a few artists,  
and quality C, which has only been done by a few artists, 
and quality D, which has only been done by a few artists, 
and I really like this unique combination of A, B, C and D.

While I recognize the fact that other artists have equally
unique combinations of A,C,E, and F; B,D,F and G; and so forth, 
these combinations don't quite appeal to me personally as much."
