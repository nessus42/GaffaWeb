 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subjct: Mailbag

    Roland/Reverend asks, "Is Kate a vegetarian?" The answer is yes
indeed she is. Your Hindi friend was no doubt speaking the truth
about Kate's onstage comment. Kate became a vegetarian at about
the age of fifteen, and has never swerved from her veg. practices
since. She has written about vegetarianism in articles for both
the _Kate_Bush_Club_Newsletter_ and in the UK magazine _Women's_World_
(an article called "How Can You Eat Dead Animals?"), and she has
offered vegetarian recipes in the _Newsletter_, as well. Also,
she appeared on the UK cooking programme _Delia_Smith's_Cookery_
once, in a segment that was taped in the garden of her family
home. In it she presented and described a variety of vegetarian
dishes (mostly cold salads), and concluded with the comment: "I
hope people will think about it, because there really is a lot
in vegetables!"
     Also, there was a report on Boston (?) radio (reported once
in L-Hs by someone out there) two years ago or so that Kate had
contributed the publication rights of one of her songs for a compilation
benefit album in support of animal rights. IED has never seen
any independent evidence to support that story, but it does sound
quite like Kate--as it is like her to give money away without
publicizing the fact. (For example, Kate has always subsidized all the
outstanding costs of running the KBC, and also paid for the cost of
the official conventions--on top of giving away all the admission
fees to charities.) In other words, not only is Kate Bush God, but
she's a very nice person as well.

-- Andrew Marvick, who strongly recommends Anne Rice's _The_Mummy_ to
   anyone searching for a truly engrossing and delightful story to read.
