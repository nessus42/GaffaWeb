In a very positive article, George (gfd@att.att.com@mtdca.att.com) writes:
[...]
&gt;the studio has certain limiting factors (to our minds), but Kate seems unaware 
&gt;of them (and thus they don't exist! (there is a nice explanation of this idea in
&gt;_Zen in the Art of Archery_ by Eugene Herrigel)).  These are ideas that both
&gt;Debussy and Cage explored.  They did not see limitations in there work.  That is
&gt;a feeling I get with a few of Kate's records: the artist's total indifference to
&gt;the ideas of limitation in their composition.

I agreed somewhat with IED's and |&gt;oug's comments on the subject, but this
is the first message in this thread that I absolutely, unreservedly agree
with.  "total indifference to the idea of limitation" is a wonderful way
of putting it, and agrees exactly with the impression I get from Kate's
music.  It also distinguishes between Kate and some of the other artists
mentioned with a clarity that I think both |&gt;oug's and IED's arguments
lacked.  But of course, that's just my opinion.  Some familiarity with
Zen helps.

&gt;P.S. If the tone of this article sounds a little negative, it is not meant to
&gt;     be.

Actually, I thought it was wonderfully positive, even downright
inspirational.

 And to your little boy and your little girl/ And the one hand clapping/
 Where on your palm is my little line/When you're written in mine/
 As an old memory"
