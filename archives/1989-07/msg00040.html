Duane Day assumes my ignorance (thanks, Duane):

&gt;&gt;TfF a serious rock act? -- hmmmm.

&gt; At the risk of earning TfF a set of IED quotation marks, I'd suggest that

&gt; First impressions notwithstanding, I think you'll find that TfF is definitely
&gt; not Wham!.

	I do happen to possess both TfF albums and used to own a copy of 
	the _Scenes'_ video (before some b*st*rd broke into my house and
	stole it, that is...).  My comment was meant to be read as my
	*opinion*, and it was contributed to the group only because I
	thought I knew enough of their stuff to have a valid one!  Do we
	really have to explicitely mark all our opinions as such in this 
	group now? (perhaps we should have the opinions' equivalent of 
	smileys -- suggestions anyone??).


&gt; a pity that the marketing machine has attempted with some success to

	I can't speak for how they've been sold in the US, as I'm British...

&gt; such as Arthur Janov (the psychologist who came up with Primal Scream
&gt; therapy - also a major influence on John Lennon and others) so as not to

	This all smacks of rather tacky pretension to my eyes.


&gt; Now, where did I leave that asbestos jumpsuit? :-)

	Why, what were you planning to do with it? 8-)



Greg (G.T.) Ward chips in:

&gt; However, their first album, "The Hurting", is brilliant 

	Ho hum.
