Duane Day (who obviously has nothing better to do than get upset at people's
opinions and, refusing to acknowledge their right to hold a different one to
his own) gets upset:

&gt; Excuse me!

	You're welcome.


&gt; A lot of people's impression of TfF, based on the _Big Chair_ hits
&gt; and the photos, is exactly that they are just another Brit-pop duo, and I've
&gt; seen them lumped together with Wham! under that heading more times than I care
&gt; to think about.

	So?


&gt; Based on limited information, I can see how someone might question that they
&gt; are serious.

	Evidently.


&gt; Based on a knowledge of their work, I find it hard to understand how one could
&gt; disagree with labeling them "serious", although whether or not they are major
&gt; league rock heavyweights is of course a matter of personal opinion.

	So??


&gt; I guess it boils down to what constitutes a "serious rock act".  No offense
&gt; was meant by my assumption that Richard was somewhat unfamiliar with the
&gt; entire body of TfF's work.

	Ah!  No it doesn't you see -- what it actually comes down to is the
	usual "My opinion is the Ultimate Truth, and you're full of
	b*llsh*t" attitude that pervades this list.


&gt; OK, given that you know a lot more about them than just a passing
&gt; acquaintance with the hits, please let me know how, in your opinion, they 
&gt; fail to qualify as "serious".   Perhaps it's their frivolous subject matter 
&gt; such as the pain of childhood?

	Good grief, Duane!  I don't know what to make of you, really I don't.
	Perhaps it's culture shock or something.


&gt; How many casual dismissals of Kate as a teen-sex-idol-pseudo-intellectual
&gt; have we suffered through, eh?

	But she is, isn't she?
	JOKE! JOKE!! JOKE!!! -- the above line is not meant to be serious!!!!


&gt; My postings reflected my opinion, just as all of the postings on this
&gt; newsgroup reflect the opinion of the authors (with the possible exception of
&gt; IED's and |&gt;oug's, which are apparently to be read as gospel.)  
&gt; :-) *just kidding, guys* (-:

	...and all responses that in any way diverge from those opinions
	give the original authors the automatic right to throw virtiol at
	the network?
	

&gt;&gt;This all smacks of rather tacky pretension to my eyes.

&gt; And again, you're entitled to that opinion.  But, please clarify - pretension
&gt; on the part of TfF, the hypothetical marketing types, or me?

	No, Duane, how could I possibly think you're pretensious? -- I've
	not met you, I've not even seen you on video, sitting in a camping
	chair talking about how you "laid yourself bare".  [&lt;-- this is IRONY]


&gt; I'm not guessing, however, about Janov being an influence; they've cited him
&gt; in many print interviews.

	Big deal.


&gt; Well, I expected to be roundly flamed for taking such a fluff group 
&gt; seriously.  It's happened before

	Now, I wonder why that could be?  (Ooops, there I go again, expressing
	my opinion -- slapped botty).


Jeffrey P. Adams asks:

&gt; "Commercially successful music has no artistic integrity."
&gt; 
&gt; That seems to be an underlying attitude of many recent postings.
&gt; Do people really believe that?  Even if you deny it, is there
&gt; something inside you that feels that it's true?

	Now, you sir have (in my opinion) a better grasp of the problem.
	There is no reason why success -&gt; ~integrity, in just the same way
	that the presence of grass implies that the ground is green; it's
	just that it's *usually* that way...


&gt; Do you think Phil Collins is a lightweight just because he has
&gt; become pheno- menally successful, or is it something about his
&gt; music?  Same for Tears for Fears, The Beatles, etc..

	Actually, The Beatles are probably a good exception to the non-rule.


&gt; Hypothetical situation: If KaTe's next album were somehow to become 
&gt; incredibly popular, outselling all other albums in history, and winning
&gt; fans among all age groups, cultural backgrounds, and educational levels,
&gt; would you somehow feel "It can't be as good," or, "Too bad she sold out."?

	Actually, |&gt;oug made this sort of observation when HoL came out, if
	memory serves (oh no, he's going to ask me to quote chapter &amp; verse
	now).


&gt; Hypothetical thought: Maybe there is merit to the above statement.
&gt; Maybe, just maybe, struggling artists have a different kind of energy,
&gt; and unpopular artists have lives more like yours and mine.  Who can
&gt; really relate to Tears for Fears's messages of suffering when we know
&gt; they're millionaires and are very successful in their careers?

	Interesting point, actually two points -- the first sounds good
	(why not write a thesis on it  :-).
	

&gt; On the other hand, maybe they're popular for a reason.  Maybe, just
&gt; maybe, their music is so good that even "normal" people find meaning
&gt; in it.  Think: Would you jump off a cliff just because everyone else
&gt; *wasn't* doing it?

	I always thought the whole raison d'etre of this list was so that
	we could all sit on our high-horse and poo-poo The Masses who went
	out and bought megatonnes of Bros/Phil Collins/Wham!/Madonna/
	(insert name of your local teeny plunkers here)?
