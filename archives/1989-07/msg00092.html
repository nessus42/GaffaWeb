Love-Hounds-request@GAFFA.MIT.EDU:
Steve Tynor says:-

 &gt;much stuff deleted&lt;
 &gt; 
 &gt; That's what I thought. I bought one of these gizmos in hopes of adding a
 &gt; more natural interface to my MIDI setup (a CZ101, Synergy, Sun
 &gt; workstation, and MIDIverb). The pitch tracking ability is really
 &gt; _pitiful_. It's virtually impossible to hold a steady note. I have a
 &gt; semi-professionally trained singing voice and can't hum well enough to
 &gt; use it as a synth controller. (its kind of like adding a 'random
 &gt; vibrato' (in semitones) to everything you do.  Ugh. Oh well. I returned
 &gt; mine after a week of frustration.
 &gt;
	 I have heard this from other sources and am not surprised
	 since even the 'steadiest' note is remarkably hard to track.
	 What needs to be done is to get a good estimate of the MIDI 
	 note number as quickly as possible and then use PITCH BEND messages
	 to track it. This avoids any nasty semitone chromatic jumps!

 &gt; Anyone out there have a used Pitchrider (by Fairlight?) that I could
 &gt; take off you're hands?  (I've heard that these are very useable for
 &gt; brass/wind instruments - how do they work on voice?)
 &gt; 

	 I have heard a demo of, but not used, the Fairlight Voicetracker
	 (I think thats what its called ?) --- VERY impressive on 
	 vocal material and horns.

	 In my own setup I use a Roland GM70 guitar-to-MIDI box (I got it 
	 very cheap!) with a modified front-end. This works very well on
	 horns, flute etc and quite passably with GOOD vocals.
	 The only limitation is the range of each of the 6 inputs is not 
	 much more than that of the corresponding guitar string (as you 
	 would probably expect!). This is less of a problem than it may sound.
