&gt;Listening to the famous "funny cigarettes" on Lily (around 2:50), I'm
&gt;pretty sure it's "Who is on the left?  Who is on the right?"  This kind of
&gt;makes sense because it's shortly before the the line "Michael to my right,
&gt;Muriel on my left side."  But there's a sound like a water drip which
&gt;partially obscures the first part of the line.

I agree--it's sounds like an electronic Kate, but it definitely says "Who's
on the left? Who's on the right?"  I also noticed that the "Who's on the
left?" line is heard only on my left speaker and "Who's on the right?" only
on my right speaker.

&gt;Has anyone else noticed the snort on You're the One?  Listen for it
&gt;at the end of the song (no Dreaming Plug required):
&gt;
&gt;	We tied ourselves in knots
&gt;	Doing cartwheels 'cross the floor&lt;snort&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This is very odd!  The only thing that makes sense to me is that she
&gt;intended a crying/sniffling type of sound, since it's hard to believe
&gt;she would leave in an unintentional snort like that.

I wouldn't call it a "snort" at all!  A snort is caused by inhaling air, this
is a definite exhale.   I think it sounds like she's just really into the
song, caught up in the emotion, and that's just how her voice reacted to the
emotion.  I don't think it was intentional.  I think it's just one of her
wonderfully unique completely unintentional expressions.  No, Kate does not
snort unless it's on purpose and in that case, I believe we'd all know it was
meant to be.
