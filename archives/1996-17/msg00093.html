Hello! I've got some awesome news that I think you need to take
two minutes to read if you have ever thought "How could I make 
some serious cash in a hurry???" , or been in serious debt,  ready 
to do almost anything to get the money needed to pay off those 
bill collectors. So grab a snack, a warm cup of coffee, or a glass 
of your favorite beverage, get comfortable and listen to this 
interesting, exciting find!  
     Let me start by saying that I FINALLY FOUND IT! That's right!
I found it! And I HATE GET RICH QUICK SCHEMES!! I hate those 
schemes like multi-level marketing, mail-order schemes, envelope
stuffing scams, 900 number scams... the list goes on forever. I 
have tried every darn get rich quick scheme out there over the 
past 12 years. I somehow got on mailing lists for people looking 
to make money (more like 'desperate stupid people who will try 
anything for money!').  Well, when I was a teenager,  these 
claims to 'get me rich quick' sounded irresistible! I would shell 
out $14.95 here, $29.95 there, $24.95 here, and another $49.95 
there.  I had maxed out my new Circuit City Card AND my Visa...I 
was desperate for money!!  So, I gave them all a chance but 
failed at every one of them! Maybe they worked for some people, 
but not for me.  Eventually, I just tossed that JUNK MAIL in the
trash when I got the mail.  I recognized it right away.  I can 
smell a money scam from a mile away these days,  SO I THOUGHT.... 
I thought I could sniff out a scam easily.  WAS I WRONG!!  
...I LOVE THE INTERNET!!!

     I was scanning thru a NEWSGROUP and saw an article stating to 
GET CASH FAST!!  I thought..."Here on the Internet??  Well, I'll 
just have to see what schemes could possibly be on the internet." 
The article described a way to MAIL A ONE DOLLAR BILL TO ONLY 
FIVE PEOPLE AND MAKE $50, 0000 IN CASH WITHIN 4 WEEKS!  Well,  
the more I thought about it, the more I became very curious. Why? 
Because of the way it worked AND BECAUSE IT WOULD ONLY COST ME 
FIVE DOLLARS (AND FIVE STAMPS), THAT'S ALL I EVER PAY....EVER!!
  
     Ok, so the $50,000 in cash was maybe an tough amount to reach, 
but it was possible.  I knew that I could at least get a return 
of $1,000 or so.  So I did it!! As per the instructions in the 
article, I mailed out ('snail mail'for you e-mail fanatics) a 
single dollar bill to each of the five people on the list that 
was contained in the article.  I included a small note, with the 
dollar, that stated "Please Add Me To Your List."  I then removed 
the first position name of the five names listed and moved 
everyone up one position, and I put my name in position five of 
the list.  When you send them the dollar that puts your name and 
address on thier postings for awhile.  This is how the money starts 
rolling in!  I then took 
this revised article now with my name on the list and REPOSTED IT 
ON AS MANY NEWSGROUPS AND LOCAL BULLETIN BOARD 
MESSAGE AREAS THAT I KNEW.  I then waited to watch the money 
come in...prepared to maybe receive about $1000 to $1500 in cash or
so....

 You 
must follow through and repost this article everywhere you can think 
of!  The more postings you achieve will determine how much cash 
will arrive in your very own mailbox!!  It's just too easy to 
pass up!!! 

   So how do you do it exactly, you ask?  I have carefully 
provided the most detailed, yet straight forward instructions on 
how to easily get this underway and get your cash on its way.  
SO, ARE YOU READY TO MAKE SOME CASH!!!?? HERE WE GO!!! 

*** THE LIST OF NAMES IS AT THE END OF THIS ARTICLE. ***
INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  Take a sheet of paper and write on it the following: 
"Please add my name to your list".  This creates a service out 
of this money making system and thus making it completely legal.  
You are not just randomly sending a dollar to someone, you are 
paying one dollar for a legitimate service.  Make sure  you 
include your name and address.  I assure you that,  again,  this 
is completely legal!  For a neat little twist, also write what 
slot their name was in: "You were in slot 3",  Just to add a 
little fun!  This is all about having fun and making money at 
the same time! 

2.  Now fold this sheet of paper around a dollar bill ,(no 
checks or money orders), and put them into an envelope and send 
it on its way to the five people listed.  The folding of the 
paper around the bill will insure its arrival to its recipient. 
THIS STEP IS IMPORTANT!! 

3.  Now listen carefully, here's where you get YOUR MONEY COMING 
TO YOUR MAILBOX.   Look at the list of five people;  remove the 
first name from position one and move everyone on the list up 
slot one on the list.  Position 2 name will now move to the 
position 1 slot ,  position 3 will now become position 2, 4 will 
be be 3, 5 wil be 4.  Now put your name, address, zipcode AND 
COUNTRY in position 5, the bottom position on the list. 

4.  Now upload this updated file to as many newsgroups and local 
bulletin boards' message areas &amp; file section as possible.  Give 
a catchy description of the file so it gets noticed!!  Such as: 
"NEED FAST CASH?, HERE IT IS!" or "NEED CASH TO PAY OFF 
YOUR DEBTS??",  etc.  And the more uploads, the more money you 
will make, and of course, the more money the others on the list will 
make too.  LET'S ALL TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER BY BEING 
HONEST AND BY PUTTING FORTH 120 PERCENT INTO THIS PROFITABLE &amp; AMAZING
SYSTEM!!! You'll reap the benefits, believe me!!! 
Set a goal for the number of total uploads you'll post, such as 
15-20 postings or more!  Always have a goal in mind!!! If you can UUE 
encode the file when uploading,  that will make it easier for the
people to receive it and have it downloaded to their hard drive.
That way they get a copy of the article right on their computer
without 
hassles of viewing and then saving the article from the File menu. 
Don't alter the file type, leave it as an MS-DOS Text file. The 
best test is to be able to view this file using Microsoft's 
Notepad for Windows 3.x or WordPad for Windows '95. If the margins 
look right without making the screen slide left or right when at 
the ends of the sentences, you're in business! 

5.  If you need help uploading, simply ask the sysop of the BBS, 
or "POST" a message on a newsgroup asking how to post a file,  
tell them who your Internet provider is and PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS BE 
GLAD TO HELP.  I would try to describe how to do it but there are 
simply too many internet software packages with slightly different 
yet relatively simple ways to post or upload a file.  Just ask for 
help or look in the help section for 'posting'. I do know that for 
GNN, you simply select 'POST' then enter a catchy description 
under the subject box, choose 'ATTACH', selecting 'UUE' and NOT 
'TXT', then choose 'Browse' to go look for the file. Find your 
text file CASH.TXT and click on it and choose 'OK'.  Place a one 
line statement in the main body section of the message post 
screen. Something like "Download this to read how to get cash 
arriving in your mailbox with no paybacks!" or whatever. Just make 
sure it represents its true feasibility, NOT something like...
"Get one million dollars flooding in your mailbox in two days!"  
You'll never get ANY responses!
 
6.  And this is the step I like.  JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY LIFE 
BECAUSE CASH IS ON ITS THE WAY!!  Expect to see a little money 
start to trickle in around 2 weeks, but AT ABOUT WEEKS 3 &amp; 4, THE 
MONEY STORM WILL HIT YOUR MAILBOX!! All you have to do is take it
out of the mailbox and try not to scream too loud (outside anyway) 
when you realize YOU HIT THE BIG TIME AT LAST!!  

7.  So go PAY OFF YOUR BILLS AND DEBTS and then get that something 
special you always wanted or buy that special person in your life 
(or the one you want in your life)  a gift they'll never forget.  
ENJOY LIFE!  

8.  Now when you get low on this money supply,  simply re-activate 
this file again; Reposting it in the old places where you 
originally posted and possibly some new places you now know of.  
Don't ever lose this file, always keep a copy at your reach for 
when you ever need cash.  THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE TOOL THAT YOU 
CAN ALWAYS RE-USE TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHEN CASH IS 
NEEDED!
