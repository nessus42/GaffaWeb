This is a straightforward way to make money fast. Please read all the 
directions and give it a chance.
If when the letter talks about newsgroups and bbs's and you don't 
understand, don't worry. Instead of doing that, just forward this letter 
to every person you have ever known.

---------------------------------------
&gt;Wow...I am REALLY asking for flames here, but I know some of you go 
&gt;to college, and could really use money, so...here it is...a way to 
&gt;get some. Please pass it on, and give me time to run before you flame 
&gt;me.
&gt;
&gt;######################################################
&gt;Hello! I've got some awesome news that I think you need to take two
&gt;minutes to read if you have ever thought "How could I make some
&gt;serious cash in a hurry???" , or been in serious debt,  ready to do
&gt;almost anything to get the money needed to pay off those bill
&gt;collectors. So grab a snack, a warm cup of coffee, or a glass of your
&gt;favorite beverage, get comfortable and listen to this interesting,
&gt;exciting find!
&gt;
&gt; Let me start by saying that I FINALLY FOUND IT! That's right! I found
&gt;it!  And I HATE GET RICH QUICK SCHEMES!! I hate those schemes like
&gt;multi-level marketing, mail-order schemes, envelope stuffing scams,
&gt;900 number scams...  the list goes on forever. I have tried every darn
&gt;get rich quick scheme out there over the past 12 years. I somehow got
&gt;on mailing lists for people looking to make money (more like
&gt;'desperate stupid people who will try anything for money!').   Well,
&gt;when I was a teenager,  these claims to 'get me rich quick' sounded
&gt;irresistible! I would shell out $14.95 here, $29.95 there, $24.95
&gt;here, and another $49.95 there.  I had maxed out my new Circuit City
&gt;Card AND my Visa...I was desperate for money!!  So, I gave them all a
&gt;chance but failed at every one of them! Maybe they worked for some
&gt;people, but not for me.  Eventually, I just tossed that JUNK MAIL in
&gt;the trash when I got the mail.  I recognized it right away.  I can
&gt;smell a money scam from a mile away these days,  SO I THOUGHT.... I
&gt;thought I could sniff out a scam easily.  WAS I WRONG!!  ....I LOVE
&gt;THE INTERNET!!!
&gt;
&gt;   I was scanning thru a NEWSGROUP and saw an article stating to GET
&gt;CASH FAST!!  I thought..."Here on the Internet??  Well, I'll just have
&gt;to see what schemes could possibly be on the internet." The article
&gt;described a way to MAIL A ONE DOLLAR BILL TO ONLY FIVE PEOPLE AND MAKE
&gt;$50, 0000 IN CASH WITHIN 4 WEEKS!  Well,  the more I thought about it,
&gt;the more I became very curious. Why?  Because of the way it worked AND
&gt;BECAUSE IT WOULD ONLY COST ME FIVE DOLLARS (AND FIVE STAMPS), THAT'S
&gt;ALL I EVER PAY....EVER!!
&gt;
&gt;   Ok, so the $50,000 in cash was maybe an tough amount to reach, but
&gt;it was possible.  I knew that I could at least get a return of $1,000
&gt;or so.  So I did it!! As per the instructions in the article, I mailed
&gt;out ('snail mail' for you e-mail fanatics)  a single dollar bill to
&gt;each of the five people on the list that was contained in the article.
&gt;I included a small note, with the dollar, that stated "Please Add Me
&gt;To Your List."  I then removed the first position name of the five
&gt;names listed and moved everyone up one position, and I put my name in
&gt;position five of the list.  This is how the money starts rolling in!
&gt;I then took this revised article now with my name on the list and
&gt;REPOSTED IT ON AS MANY NEWSGROUPS AND LOCAL BULLETIN BOARD
&gt;MESSAGE AREAS THAT I KNEW.  I then waited to watch the money come
&gt;in...prepared to maybe receive about $1000 to $1500 in cash or so....
&gt;But what a welcome surprise when those envelopes kept coming in!!!  I
&gt;knew what they were as soon as I saw the return addresses from people
&gt;all over the world  -Most from the U.S., but some from Canada, even
&gt;some from Australia!  I tell you, THAT WAS EXCITING!!  So how much did
&gt;I get in total return?  $1000? $5000? Not even!!! I received a total
&gt;of $23,343!!!  I couldn't believe it!!
&gt;
&gt;   I now have a brand new black Acura Integra to speak for, due to
&gt;this!! Now after almost 8 months, I am ready to do it again!!! So
&gt;maybe it was possible to get $50,000 in cash, I don't know, but  IT
&gt;COMPLETELY DEPENDS ON YOU, THE INDIVIDUAL!  You must follow through
&gt;and repost this article everywhere you can think of!  The more
&gt;postings you achieve will determine how much cash will arrive in your
&gt;very own mailbox!!  It's just too easy to pass up!!!
&gt;
&gt;   Let's review the reasons why you should do this:  The only cost
&gt;factors are for the five stamps, the 5 envelopes and the 5 one dollar
&gt;bills that you send out to the listed names by snail mail (US Postal
&gt;Service Mail).  Then just simply repost the article (WITH YOUR NAME
&gt;ADDED) to all the newsgroups and local BBS's you can.  Then sit back
&gt;and, (ironically), enjoy walking  (you can run if you like! :o  ) down
&gt;your driveway to your mailbox and scoop up your rewards!!  We all have
&gt;five dollars to put into such an easy effortless investment with
&gt;SPECTACULAR REALISTIC RETURNS OF $15,000 to $25,000 in about 3-5
&gt;weeks!  So HOLD OFF ON THOSE LOTTERY NUMBERS FOR TODAY,
&gt;EAT AT HOME TONIGHT INSTEAD OF TAKEOUT FROM McDONALDS AND INVEST FIVE
&gt;
&gt;DOLLARS IN THIS AMAZING MONEY MAKING SYSTEM NOW!!! YOU CAN'T LOSE!!
&gt;
&gt;   So how do you do it exactly, you ask?  I have carefully provided
&gt;the most detailed, yet straightforward instructions on how to easily
&gt;get this underway and get your cash on its way.  SO, ARE YOU READY TO
&gt;MAKE SOME CASH!!!?? HERE WE GO!!!
&gt;
&gt;*** THE LIST OF NAMES IS AT THE END OF THIS ARTICLE. ***
&gt;
&gt;OK,  Read this carefully.  Get a printout of this information, if you
&gt;like, so you can easily refer to it as often as needed.
&gt;
&gt;INSTRUCTIONS:
&gt;
&gt;1.  Take a sheet of paper and write on it the following: "Please add
&gt;my name to your list".  This creates a service out of this money
&gt;making system and thus making it completely legal.  You are not just
&gt;randomly sending a dollar to someone, you are paying one dollar for a
&gt;legitimate service.  Make sure you include your name and address.  I
&gt;assure you that,  again,  this is completely legal!  For a neat little
&gt;twist, also write what slot their name was in: "You were in slot 3",
&gt;Just to add a little fun!  This is all about having fun and making
&gt;money at the same time!
&gt;
&gt;2.  Now fold this sheet of paper around a dollar bill ,(no checks or
&gt;money orders), and put them into an envelope and send it on its way to
&gt;the five people listed.  The folding of the paper around the bill will
&gt;insure its arrival to its recipient. THIS STEP IS IMPORTANT!!
&gt;
&gt;3.  Now listen carefully, here's where you get YOUR MONEY COMING TO
&gt;YOUR MAILBOX.   Look at the list of five people;  remove the first
&gt;name from position one and move everyone on the list up slot one on
&gt;the list.  Position 2 name will now move to the position 1 slot ,
&gt;position 3 will now become position 2, 4 will be 3, 5 will be 4.  Now
&gt;put your name, address, zipcode AND COUNTRY in position 5, the bottom
&gt;position on the list.
&gt;
&gt;4.  Now upload this updated file to as many newsgroups and local
&gt;bulletin boards' message areas &amp; file section as possible.  Give a
&gt;catchy description of the file so it gets noticed!!  Such as: "NEED
&gt;FAST CASH?, HERE IT IS!" or "NEED CASH TO PAY OFF YOUR DEBTS??",  etc.
&gt;And the more uploads, the more money you will make, and of course, the
&gt;more money the others on the list will make too.  LET'S ALL TAKE CARE
&gt;OF EACH OTHER BY BEING HONEST AND BY PUTTING FORTH 120 PERCENT INTO
&gt;THIS PROFITABLE &amp; AMAZING SYSTEM!!! You'll reap the benefits, believe
&gt;me!!! Set a goal for the number of total uploads you'll post, such as
&gt;15-20 postings or more!  Always have a goal in mind!!!
&gt;If you can UUE encode the file when uploading,  that will make it
&gt;easier for the people to receive it and have it downloaded to their
&gt;hard drive.  That way they get a copy of the article right on their
&gt;computer without hassles of viewing and then saving the article from
&gt;the File menu. Don't alter the file type, leave it as an MS-DOS Text
&gt;file. The best test is to be able to view this file using Microsoft's
&gt;Notepad for Windows 3.x or WordPad for Windows '95. If the margins
&gt;look right without making the screen slide left or right when at the
&gt;ends of the sentences, you're in business!
&gt;
&gt;5.  If you need help uploading, simply ask the sysop of the BBS, or
&gt;"POST" a message on a newsgroup asking how to post a file,  tell them
&gt;who your Internet provider is and PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS BE GLAD TO HELP.
&gt;I would try to describe how to do it but there are simply too many
&gt;internet software packages with slightly different yet relatively
&gt;simple ways to post or upload a file.  Just ask for help or look in
&gt;the help section for 'posting'. I do know that for GNN, you simply
&gt;select 'POST' then enter a catchy description under the subject box,
&gt;choose 'ATTACH', selecting 'UUE' and NOT 'TXT', then
&gt;choose 'Browse' to go look for the file. Find your text file CASH.TXT
&gt;and click on it and choose 'OK'.  Place a one line statement in the
&gt;main body section of the message post screen. Something like "Download
&gt;this to read how to get cash arriving in your mailbox with no
&gt;paybacks!" or whatever. Just make sure it represents its true
&gt;feasibility, NOT something like..."Get one million dollars flooding in
&gt;your mailbox in two days!"  You'll never get ANY responses!
&gt;
&gt;6.  And this is the step I like.  JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY LIFE BECAUSE
&gt;
&gt;CASH IS ON ITS THE WAY!!  Expect to see a little money start to
&gt;trickle in around 2 weeks, but AT ABOUT WEEKS 3 &amp; 4, THE MONEY STORM
&gt;WILL HIT YOUR MAILBOX!! All you have to do is take it out of the
&gt;mailbox and try not to scream too loud (outside anyway) when you
&gt;realize YOU HIT THE BIG TIME AT LAST!!
&gt;
&gt;7.  So go PAY OFF YOUR BILLS AND DEBTS and then get that something
&gt;special you always wanted or buy that special person in your life (or
&gt;the one you want in your life)  a gift they'll never forget.   ENJOY
&gt;LIFE!
&gt;
&gt;8.  Now when you get low on this money supply,  simply re-activate
&gt;this file again; Reposting it in the old places where you originally
&gt;posted and possibly some new places you now know of.  Don't ever lose
&gt;this file, always keep a copy at your reach for when you ever need
&gt;cash.  THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE TOOL THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS RE-USE TIME AND
&gt;TIME AGAIN WHEN CASH IS NEEDED!
