&gt;&gt;My personal views are that Tori is *at least* as talented, original, and
&gt;&gt;brilliant as Kate Herself.  This is because there are times when I'm not in
&gt;&gt;the mood to listen to Kate, but I cannot recall any times when I haven't
&gt;&gt;been in the mood to listen to Tori.

&gt;    This is a somewhat bogus criteria. How many times a day do you want
&gt;to experience the emotional catharsis of _The Ninth Wave_. Any time
&gt;I sit down and listen to it tears well in my eyes, and I get goosebumps.

I'm not talking about listening to it more than once a day.  I can't listen
to LE twice in one day either; it's too draining.  I mean there just hasn't
been a "no Tori today" day, whereas there have been many "no Kate today"
days, not because it's too affecting, but because I just don't feel like it. 
I know someone's good if I can always listen to them

&gt;It can get embarrassing when listening to a walkman on the bus.

So can listening to "This Woman's Work" and being compelled to mouth the
words (if not actually sing them) and crying on the bus!  :)  (tortured
sentence alert)

&gt;&gt;  Tori also pleases me with her albums more;

&gt;    Frankly, "pleasing" me isn't very important either, in evaluating
&gt;the worth of an artist's work. Paula Abdul "pleases" a great many people
&gt;by not challenging them.

I'm not talking about pleasing just anybody, I'm talking about pleasing
*me*.  Not that I'm some highbrow music critic, but I consider myself to
have some modicum of taste, and if I'm pleased by it, there must be
*something* decent about it.  I think Paula Abdul is very challenging--it's
a challenge to sit through an entire album without being nauseous!  :)

&gt;&gt;granted, there's only one album so far (besides WKTR), but there's
&gt;&gt;only one song out of twelve that I find less than amazing ("Me and a Gun",
&gt;&gt;for anyone who cares), whereas there are usually more than 1/12 that I find
&gt;&gt;inferior on Kate's albums. 

&gt;    _Me and a Gun_ "less than amazing"?!? Maybe you need to see her in
&gt;concert...

At the moment, I would *kill* to see her in concert.

&gt;    It was probably the hardest song for her to write, and the one that
&gt;most clearly points out the *differences* between Kate and Tori. Kate
&gt;could *never* write write a song that revealed so much of herself,
&gt;that left her so vunerable, so emotionally naked...and to have the
&gt;guts to perform it *every single night*... 

I agree.  Maybe I'm not as affected by it because I know it's coming.  It
sounds so deadened and unemotional on the album...I'm sure it's better in
concert.

&gt;    Kate, by her Catholic school education, insulated family life, 
&gt;the cultural differences between England and America, has an entirely
&gt;different way of expressing her emotions than Tori. You have to dig
&gt;deep into Kates's music when trying to understand her feelings. Tori
&gt;_wants_ you to know her.

I also see Kate as more theatrical than Tori--you don't know if Kate is
talking about herself or someone else.


&gt;    In some ways this has made Kate the more original composer. Not
&gt;encumbered by the strictures of a classical musical education, blab,
&gt;blab, blab...

Blab is right.  Tori doesn't sound encumbered *at all*.  In fact, I think
it's more encumbering not to have a classical musical education, because you
must know something to escape its confines.

&gt;    I wish everyone could have heard _Sat In Your Lap_ in the context
&gt;of the charts at the time. It was, especially at the time, a stunning
&gt;departure from the rest of the music world. It (and the rest of _The

It still is, in my opinion!  :)  SIYL is one of my favorite Katesongs.


&gt;&gt;Granted, Kate has a certain literary merit, but Tori's music is equally
&gt;&gt;fascinating, just quite different.  And *nobody* does covers like she does.

&gt;   Take a listen to some of Hal Wilner's compilations. Check out Tom
&gt;Waits' "Hi Ho, Hi Ho" on _Stay Awake_ and repeat that with a straight
&gt;face. 

Do you mean that these two do covers the same way Tori does?  Because that's
what I meant.  I wasn't saying her covers were better than everyone
else's....
