&gt;	According to a comics trade publication ("What's New"), 
&gt;Revolutionary Comics will be putting out an issue of their "Rock `n' 
&gt;Roll" book featuring the peerless musical genius of Kate Bush!!  (Paying
&gt;attention, David R. Henry?)  It will ship to comic stores in February.  
&gt;The comic is an "Unauthorised and proud of it!" series of biographies of 
&gt;famous musicians / groups.
&gt;
&gt;	Here's the blurb in full:
&gt;
&gt;	ROCK `N' ROLL COMICS #58
&gt;	KATE BUSH .......................... $2.50 Amer. / $3.00 Cdn.
&gt;
&gt;	(by Jay Allen Sanford / Marshall Ross &amp; April Lee)
&gt;	The fairy princess of rock and an enduring cult favorite.
&gt;Little seemed to be known about the ethereal singer's life until
&gt;Revolutionary got on the case.  Six months in the making, meticulously
&gt;researched and beautifully illustrated, this one promises to be a
&gt;perennial seller.  RANDOM COPIES SIGNED BY WRITER AND ARTISTS.
&gt;
&gt;	I picked up the issues with Rush and R.E.M. in the past, and
&gt;they were pretty good.  The art, however, was probably below average.
&gt;Myself and fellow KaTe FanaTiK, comic artist wanna-be, and friend, JaKe
&gt;used to speculate about the possibility of them doing a Kate effort.  We
&gt;agreed that it would have to be, to say the least, done well.  Excellent
&gt;art, and well-documented history are a must.  If the above blurb is to
&gt;be believed, it sounds like they took the task seriously -- perhaps
&gt;aware of the fans' blood-lust that would come down on them if they did
&gt;anything less than a perfect job. :-)  Sometime (probably Monday), I'll 
&gt;post their snail-mailing address. 
&gt;	Needless to say, I will be getting _several_ copies of this!

                She was the kind of woman who lived for others.
                You could tell the others by their hunted look.
