Hello everyone,

Modern Day Warrior &lt;Trev@kolinahr.demon.co.uk&gt; wrote:

&gt;&gt; I think you don't know what Me and a Gun is about, rape (I think I do
&gt;&gt; not sound like a fool, but, though I like Kate better than her, I have
&gt;&gt; adopted some kind of respect for Tori Amos !). James and the Cold Gun
&gt;&gt; is COMPLETELY different.
&gt;Her own rape.
 
       According to various interviews as well as the FAQ, Tori wrote 'Me
And A Gun' after seeing 'Thelma And Louise' which, to her, brought back a
lot of bad memories, and in many ways gave her the strength she needed to
start dealing with the awful experience she once had with a stalker. She has
never confirmed, however, that 'MAAG' is about her own rape, or indeed that
she was ever raped. It's just the conclusion that a lot of people jumped to
on hearing the song. However, Tori has said that 'MAAG' helped her 'stop
being a victim in her own head'
 

Then Glenn Duley Smith &lt;smith@midsoft.com&gt; said:
  
&gt;I am a big Tori fan, but I am a HUGE Kate fan. 
&gt;Kate's music, for me, holds a lot of "light", whereas 
&gt;Tori's holds much "dark".
 
       I agree. Tori's music definitely has a much darker edge to it than
Kate's. I've found most of Kate's work, even some of the heartwrenching
songs, to hold a lot of optimism, whereas Tori's have a lot of hidden anger
and cynicism. I've never found that kind of cynicism or sarcasm in Kate's
material.
  


Across the room, John D. Walker &lt;jdwalker@post.cis.smu.edu&gt; arose and said: 

&gt;Boy this Tori/Kate thing has got out of hand (again) hasn't it?  I like 
&gt;'em both.  It took a LLLLLOOOOONNNNNGGGGGG time for Little Earthquakes to 
&gt;grow on me, but it did (finally).  I like Sarah McLachlan a lot, too.  
&gt;And Heather Nova.  They're all great.  Let's enjoy 'em while they're here.

           Yes!! The voice of reason in the wilderness! :) I agree
wholeheartedely, John.. Kate and Tori are not 'rivals' and there's room
enough for everyone.
 

&gt;Time to start a new flamage topic:  IMO, Kate's more recent efforts have 
&gt;not sounded all that hot.  The songs are there but the recording and 
&gt;production are lacking 
             
         I loved the production of 'The Red Shoes', although I have to say
productionwise 'The Dreaming' remains a firm favourite. Maybe Kate has
gotten stuck in some kind of rut, and a change would be good. 

&gt;I'd like to see Kate consider an outside producer for her new album, just 
&gt;to get some fresh technical input.  Now, who should it be?

        Hmmm.. hard one.. Rupert Hine or Daniel Lenois perhaps? 
 
    
                             Later folks :)


                                     Emmy.
