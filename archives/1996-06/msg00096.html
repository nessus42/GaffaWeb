[Rinfi The Gypsy (Playing Canasta in Cold Rooms)]
&gt;I fell in love with Rinfi the gypsy.   [Rinfrey? English name specialists?]
&gt;He said when I grew up he'd marry me, 
&gt;Carry me away on his steed. 
&gt;"Don't worry, my honey! 
&gt;Don't die, my funny little doll! 
&gt;I'm going away for a little while. 
&gt;Shouldn't be gone for very long." 
&gt;(Ooh, long, long, long...)   [?]   

  Ooh, Then I really fell for Geoffrey our gardener
  He said he'd marry me too

*&gt;Oh, and I believed him, just like a fool. 

&gt;"Don't worry, my honey! 
&gt;Don't die, my funny little doll! 
&gt;I'm going away for a little while. 
&gt;Shouldn't be gone for very long."

   Playing Canasta in cold rooms 
   Playing Canasta
   Upstairs, downstairs and in my lover's room..

  I  met a boy, who took me upstairs,
  then took me in his arms and told me I comforted him. aha..

  Don't worry my dear, don't cry you weird old stranger,
  I'm going away,
  you probably won't ever see me again

  Oh yes, I know, I'm always falling
  Gazing at hazy goldfish in your swimming eyes
&gt;How could I not lie there with you? 

&gt;"Don't worry, my darling! 
&gt;Don't die, my silly little baby! 
&gt;I'm going away for a little while, 
&gt;And shouldn't be gone for very long." 
&gt;(Ooh, long, long, long!)

[Dali (Ferry Me Over)]
&gt;High, 
&gt;And can't see you.
&gt;You've seen your ..[?]. Dali    [your -en- Dali?]
       
    I've seen your room, Dali? / lives in your room, Dali?

&gt;Alone and higher still 
&gt;She keeps her gallery. 
&gt;Distance means nothing 
&gt;To me. 

    Debry everywhere
    gazing, it's amazing
    Ferry me over 
    Ferry me over
    Ferry me over
    The music Dali

  Deeper here ... [.... ?]
  Answers and treasures for him
  [...?]
  My heart goes under alone/grows stronger alone?

[Where Are The Lionhearts (On the Rocks)]
...
&gt;Climbing up the adders  [meaning ?]
&gt;To slide down the adders 
&gt;On the rocks (X4)
&gt;Joan of Arc walks into my mirror, 
&gt;A burning sword. 
&gt;I'd like to cry. 
&gt;I look into her eyes. 
&gt;I see she's sitting long days and night. [?]
  
     I'm looking into her eyes and see she's seen ..  [?]

&gt;"Ooh," she says, 
&gt;"The games are still the same, I see, 
&gt;But they've changed the names now. 
&gt;Are all Lionhearts put in parks, apart?" 
....
   

[Rare Flower (Pick the Rare Flower)]
&gt;....
&gt;I'm not allowed to touch on lust, 

                            =&gt; touch and lust?

&gt;I've gotta get a hold of myself. 
&gt;I must-----doo-doo-doo-doo-doo...  
..

&gt;It's calling me. 
&gt;Would I've ever see him whisper of  [?]  

=&gt;with a magazine-whisper     
 
&gt;Magical world enchanting me  

=&gt;Magic of it enchanting me

&gt;why I've gotta get a hold of myself, 
&gt;You see, but it ain't easy. 
 

[While Davy Dozed (Davy)]
&gt;I stayed the night in your arms. 
&gt;Over half an hour I stayed awake, 
&gt;Looking at you. 

&gt;Your face seemed radiant.   [radianced?]
                     
                          =&gt; radiant

&gt;The walls ---------,   [to stear?]     &lt;---- VERY DIFFICULT!!

=&gt;The wall with the ceiling with the crack remembers

&gt;As I held you. 
&gt;
&gt;Oo-ooh... 
&gt;While na-na na-na-na na-na-na Davy dozed. 
&gt;I closed my eyes. 

&gt;- ------------------- 
&gt;       [you likes the time is close for us to go?]    &lt;---- VERY DIFFICULT!!

=&gt;Realise the time is close for us to go

&gt;Hold me, oh hold me. 
&gt;....
 
 
      Just my two cents..


                      Emmy.
