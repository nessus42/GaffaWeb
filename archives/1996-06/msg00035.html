&gt; such a good singer. And she had such a terrible time at this particular
&gt; concert, because we all had to meet the Prince of Wales, and when you get
&gt; introduced to your future king, you get nervous and your hands get sweaty
&gt; and ...ssss... all that shaking hands stuff... [&lt;- i didn't get that all]
&gt; You know that he doesn't know who you are, he knows nothing about pop music.
&gt; 
&gt; We were all standing in a line up, I was next to four black guys, the name
&gt; of which I don't remember, from some black soul group, and on the other
&gt; side was Kate Bush.
&gt; And he came and spoke to the black guys, he thought I was in the same
&gt; band with them, and ...[here Mr. Anderson is talking too fast for me]...
&gt; that just shows how little he knows about music.
&gt; Then he moved on to me, and I said a few words, and then it was Kate Bush.
&gt; And she went to pieces, she cracked up, she just couldn't...
&gt; [guesturing] she was blblblblblbl... couldn't speak to him, completely
&gt; downtied [??], and was so embarrased by him, she made a fool of herself,
&gt; she thought. She was just nervous.
&gt; And he smiled at her and thought she was quite funny. And afterwards
&gt; she was so embarrassed, she had _embarrassed_ herself in front of her
&gt; future king.

And Prince Charles was later heard to remark that he had no idea that 
B.P.I. stood for British Pornographic Industry...
Ouch!

Mo.
