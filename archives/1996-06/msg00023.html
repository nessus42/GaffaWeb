If someone would be willing to make some cassettes of some Kate b$$ts
(Under the Ivy, Cathy Demos, etc.) email me.  I would be more than willing
to pay postage and provide tapes (in usual Love Hounds fashion).  I can
provide the Love Hounds Collection and Total Tape Integration for anyone who
doesn't have them in exchange if desired, and maybe some other stuff.

Boy this Tori/Kate thing has got out of hand (again) hasn't it?  I like 
'em both.  It took a LLLLLOOOOONNNNNGGGGGG time for Little Earthquakes to 
grow on me, but it did (finally).  I like Sarah McLachlan a lot, too.  
And Heather Nova.  They're all great.  Let's enjoy 'em while they're here.

Time to start a new flamage topic:  IMO, Kate's more recent efforts have 
not sounded all that hot.  The songs are there but the recording and 
production are lacking (**slipping on IED/Wieland-proof asbestos suit**).  
Both Tori and Sarah make great sounding records, from a technical standpoint.  
Sarah's last two albums are recorded incredibly well - everything sounds 
very natural and the drum and bass sounds are gorgeous, along with the 
voice.  Tori's albums are also very well recorded and very rich 
sounding.  Peter Gabriel comes to mind also as an artist who makes 
awesome sounding albums (I use "So" to demo high-end stereos when I go 
shopping for stuff).  Why can't Kate make records that sound as good as 
these?  You'd think with 4 years between 'em that she'd get it right.  Or
maybe she re-records the tracks so much that the tape gets worn out?  ;-)  
Or maybe Tori's right - Kate's screamed with headphones on tracking 
vocals for so many years that she's damaged her hearing!

I'd like to see Kate consider an outside producer for her new album, just 
to get some fresh technical input.  Now, who should it be?

John (in full flame-retardant gear)
