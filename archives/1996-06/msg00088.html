[first transcribed by IED (Andrew B. Marvick), later on improved and corrected 
by various love-hounds (e.g. Bryan Dongray and Scott Telford).] 

We should all try to use the Phoenix broadcast titles, because they seem to be 
correct. At least no inconsistencies have been found. IED's titles are given in 
brackets. 

Everybody is invited and encouraged to listen carefully again to the difficult 
passages. Some are almost inaudible. 

I went through the complete set several times and corrected  or inserted a
word here and there and tried to sort out the wrong suggestions. 
It's surprising how much we have correct now!
In a month or so I will put the complete and up-to-date demo-lyrics into the
LH-archive. 

What follows are only the main problematic passages: Listen again! 
Give it another try!  Bryan! Scott! 

Enjoy!
Wieland

----------------------
Rinfi The Gypsy (Playing Canasta in Cold Rooms)
----------------------

I fell in love with Rinfi the gypsy.   [Rinfrey? English name specialists?]
He said when I grew up he'd marry me, 
Carry me away on his steed. 
....
Oh, and I believed him, just like a fool. 

"Don't worry, my honey! 
Don't die, my funny little doll! 
I'm going away for a little while. 
Shouldn't be gone for very long." 
(Ooh, long, long, long...)   [?]      &lt;---- VERY DIFFICULT!!
....
How could I not lie there with you? 

"Don't worry, my darling! 
Don't die, my silly little baby! 
I'm going away for a little while, 
And shouldn't be gone for very long." 
(Ooh, long, long, long!) 
....


-------------------
Dali (Ferry Me Over)
-------------------

High, 
And can't see you.
You've seen your ..[?]. Dali    [your -en- Dali?]
Alone and higher still 
She keeps her gallery. 
Distance means nothing 
To me. 
...


-------------------
Where Are The Lionhearts (On the Rocks)
-------------------

Destiny took me in her arms and told me: 
"You're a little lost on the fall. 
You fall for all the men 
You shouldn't fall for at all."      [it all?]
Ooh, I know she knows, but still I go on, 
Well, I'm a fool. 

Climbing up the adders  [meaning ?]
To slide down the adders 
On the rocks, 
On the rocks, 
On the rocks, 
On the rocks... 

Joan of Arc walks into my mirror, 
A burning sword. 
I'd like to cry. I look into her eyes. 
I see she's sitting long days and night. [?]
"Ooh," she says, 
"The games are still the same, I see, 
But they've changed the names now. 
Are all Lionhearts put in parks, apart?" 
....


-------------------
Violin (demo version)
-------------------

....
Hear the haunting melody. 
Leave me enough for my country. 
Here in a wood, in a green story  [meaning?]
	[Tour of Life: "Here in a wood, in the green valley."] 
...


---------------------
The Craft of Love (Craft of Life)
---------------------

I tried to study it for just a while: 
All of the potions, from oysters to seducing smiles. 
But I've found it's already inside me: 
A big warm bubble of sensuality, 
There to be burst, 
But worried about getting hurt.  [about?  , and out?]
...




-------------------
Something Like A Song 
-------------------
...
I see him when I turn the lights down low, 
In my garden, wading through the pond. 
Rest and sing: "Lover oooooooh                      [? 'Lover' uncertain] 
"Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, hoooo" 
...


--------------
Frightened Eyes 
--------------

Just traveling on a bus 
&gt;From a friend's house, 
And all these people are looking at me. 
They're gazing out windows, 
At any English country gardens. [At?]
...


--------------------
Nevertheless, You'll Do 
--------------------
....
I fill the room with people 
but still you sit empty, 
Stuck like putty. 
I tried to teach you good rock'n'roll, 
But you couldn't get over the old one-two, 
And nevertheless, you'll do. 
Nevertheless, you'll do. 
Nevertheless, I do.    [I hear "I" here, not "you'll"]

....
I fill the room with people 
but still you sit empty, 
Stuck like putty. 
I tried to teach you good rock'n'roll, 
But you couldn't get over the old one-two, 
And nevertheless, you'll do. 
Nevertheless, you'll do. 
Nevertheless, I do.   ["I" or "you'll"]



-----------------
Rare Flower (Pick the Rare Flower)
-----------------
....
I'm not allowed to touch on lust, 
I've gotta get a hold of myself. 
I must-----doo-doo-doo-doo-doo...   [I mustn't admit it?]
....
It's calling me. 
Would I've ever see him whisper of  [?]  &lt;---- VERY DIFFICULT!!
Magical world enchanting me    [?]    &lt;---- VERY DIFFICULT!!
why I've gotta get a hold of myself, 
You see, but it ain't easy. 


--------------------
While Davy Dozed (Davy)
-------------------

I stayed the night in your arms. 
Over half an hour I stayed awake, 
Looking at you. 

Your face seemed radiant.   [radianced?]
The walls ---------,   [to stear?]     &lt;---- VERY DIFFICULT!!
With a crack emerge. 
As I held you. 

Oo-ooh... 
While na-na na-na-na na-na-na Davy dozed. 
I closed my eyes. 
------------------- 
       [you likes the time is close for us to go?]    &lt;---- VERY DIFFICULT!!
Hold me, oh hold me. 
....




-------------------
Kite (demo version)
-------------------

....
"Come up and be a kite, 
On a diamond flight!   [And fly a diamond night?]
As diamond kite, a diamond kite. 
Ooh, what a diamond! 

....
"Come up and be a kite, 
On a diamond flight!   [And fly a diamond night?]
A diamond kite, a diamond kite. 
Ooh, what a diamond! 
....


********************************
At last we have the 'MASTER-OF-THE-LYRICS'-fight between Bryan Dongray 
and Scott Telford. The hardest Kate-nut to crack! As an independent referee I 
present here the version I hear best: It's a mixture. 
Really great song, but it drives you crazy! What a wishy-washy!

Scares Me Silly
---------------

Here in the studio, 
As they're turning down the lights, 
I lick my lips to start the first line--
How come they're scolding me? 
"Oh, little thing, are you looking lost?"
The vertigo, the need to lose. [?]

Ooh, ooh... 
They try to trip me up, the tapes begin to spin  [?]   &lt;---- VERY DIFFICULT!!
I feel a little sick and hope my notes are in [?] &lt;---- VERY DIFFICULT!!
I try to -------do it for you. 
	[I try to put it ------- do it for you]    &lt;---- VERY DIFFICULT!!
	[I try to put it all in, do it  for you]
	[I try to put it on it, do it for you.]
	[I try to put it all into it for you]
Don't even know you but I need you to love me, too. 

They try to trip me up and tapes begin to spin. [? same as above] 
I feel a little sick and hope my notes are in [? same as above] 
I try to -------do it for you.  [? same as above]
Don't even know you but I need you to love me, too. 

Scares me silly, but it gets me going, 
Like a Romeo. 
Scares me silly, but it gets me going, 
Like a Romeo. 
Scares me silly, but it gets me going. 

Swimming amid the cans,  [?] 
I wonder can I goad myself into another take, 
And keep the mood? 
It's like a ---------------. [?]                             &lt;---- VERY
VERY, VERY, VERY DIFFICULT!!
	[It's like a music balance.?] 
	[It's like a film - such balance/colours, ?]
	[I always hear: It's like a moon sex balance.  :-) Wie.]
I close my eyes to the cello solo,  [? more like "our" ?]
And make the [?] music.                             &lt;---- VERY VERY, VERY,
VERY DIFFICULT!!
	[????? music, I think this might be one word rather 
	  than "And ??? the music". --Scott Telford] 
will never let me blow away. [?]

You, 
You know the feeling when you're on the right track. 
You fall in love and you're never gonna turn it back. 
-----------------------.  
	[It's recording your [?] representative ?] &lt;---- VERY VERY, VERY, VERY
DIFFICULT!!
	[     - I definitely hear "...sentative". -Scott Telford] 
-------------------------------.          &lt;---- VERY VERY, VERY, VERY
DIFFICULT!!
	[Losing without me, brimming over with secrets.]
	[Oozing without me spilling over with feelings. 
	[   - I don't hear a consonant before 
	     "oozing" ("using"?)  Scott] 
You know the feeling when you're on the right track. 
You fall in love and you're never gonna turn it back. 
-------------------------------.  [same as above]
-------------------------------. [same as above]

Scares me silly, but it gets me going, 
Like a Romeo. 
Scares me silly, but it gets me going, 
Like a Romeo. 
Scares me silly, but it gets me going. 




-------------
Babooshka 1 (early, solo-piano demo version)
-------------

.....
Uncanny how she 
Reminds him of the [his?] beyond see [?] [hills beyond sea?]
She seems to know the way to please him, 
Just like his wife before she freezed on him, 
Just like his wife when she was beautiful. 
....



--------------
Babooshka 2 ("rhythm-box" demo version)
--------------

....
Uncanny how she 
Can take him back into the blue summers, ['summaaaars' ?] 
			[Bryan's 'piece of Mars' :-)]
Can say the things that make him want to laugh, 
Just like his wife before she freezed on him, 
Just like his wife when she was beautiful. 
...
