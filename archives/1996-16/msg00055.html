Archive-name: music/kate-bush-faq-diffs
Last-modified: 1996/03/31
Version: 1.4.h minus 1.4.e

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action.  The full version is posted to
rec.music.gaffa only.  You can get a full copy of the FAQ by requesting it from
me (uli@zoodle.robin.de), or by sending email to majordomo@gryphon.com with the
message contents being "get love-hounds-digest FAQ".  If you can't receive more
than 64KB in one piece I can split the FAQ for you.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.  Cosmetical changes aren't listed.



And again, sorry for the 6-day delay in getting out the FAQ. But as usual,
I haven't had too much time lately to read my email. This weekend I finally
had, and so here it is - the newest copy of the FAQ!

Bye,

Uli

-------------------8&lt;-------------------
2.1. Who is Happy Rhodes?

     Love-Hounds was founded with the idea of being a newsgroup about
     "Progressive Artists with emphasis on Kate Bush", so discussions
     about other "progressive artists" are generally encouraged.  However,
     occasionally the talk about a different artist grows to a point where
     it is appropriate to form a separate group.  This is what happened
     with Happy Rhodes (this is really her name), whose song "Feed The Fire"
     (from Warpaint) was the most requested song on WXPN, a Philadelphia
     radio station.  Happy Rhodes discussion now takes place on an ever-
     growing mailing list founded by Jessica Koeppel called Ecto.  If you want
     to subscribe to this list, whose broad range of discussion now includes
     many other female artists (including Kate Bush), send a request to
     the Ecto organisation via:

[As Bill Wisner pointed out, I didn't mention Jessica's surname. So here it is!
And besides that, the text stillr referred to Rutgers, instead of ecto.org]

2.2. Who is Tori Amos?

     Since Really-Deep-Thoughts has had a few problems in its past, there are
     now several other Tori Amos mailing lists:

     Torinews (originally for news only)

        subscribe: johns@chihuly.com
                   Subject: Subscribe Torinews
        post:      torinews@chihuly.com

     Precious-Things (meant for discussion about Tori)

        subscribe: precious-things-request@smoe.org or
                   precious-things-digest-request@smoe.org
                   Body: subscribe
        post:      precious-things@smoe.org

     Tori-Boot (flame-free discussion about bootlegs)

        subscribe: majordomo@world.std.com
                   Body: subscribe tori-boot
		post:      tori-boot@world.std.com

[New part of the Tori Amos part, since there are now four mailing lists and
a newsgroup dedicated to a single artist...]

2.4. MUSHrooms influenced by Kate

     (MUSH is Multi-User Shared Hallucination.)  There's a heavily
     Kate-influenced MUSHroom.  To access it, you need a direct internet
     connection and telnet.  Type:

        telnet tinycwru.chaco.com 4201

     And once you're logged on, type

        @tel #91468

     at the prompt.
[...]
     Along with a Virtual Kate Paradise (which Steve called "Gaffaland"), you
     can have real-time chat with your fellow Lovehounds! [SB]

[New home and name for the Kate MUSHroom]
4.4. Basic Discography/Videography

     At present the artists appearing on this will be:
     - Maire Brennan - O Bhean A'Ti (accent on the 'O')
     - Tim &amp; Neil Finn - Mary of the South Seas
     - Bono &amp; Adam Clayton - Tomorrow
     - Sharon Shannon - Cavan Potholes
     - Paul Brady - Help Me to Believe
     - Sinead O'Connor - On Raglan Road
     - Brian Kennedy - As I Roved Out
     - Elvis Costello - The Night Before Larry Was Stretched
     - Kate Bush - Mna Na h-Eireann (accent on the 'a' in Mna)

     - Andy Irvine - My Heart's Tonight in Ireland
     - Liam O Maonlai - Cathain
     - Christy Moore - Bogie's Bonnie Belle

     Unfortunately, the release date of the album has been set back to
     September.

[Thanks to Wieland for putting together a specialized FAQ about Mna Na h-Eireann]

4.5. Other Artists using Kate's Work

     Cover versions of Kate's songs:
        Dusty Springfield - (no recording known) [RMC]
            (concert in The Royal Albert Hall in 1978) [KO]

[More info on where and when this one happened]

4.9. Electronic books

        A Hypertext version of The Garden is also available:

           <A  HREF="http://www.ecto.org/garden/">http://www.ecto.org/garden/</A>

[Another new home]

4.12.Kate Bush World Wide Web (WWW) pages

     Really Great Must-See Pages:

     The Garden:
        <A  HREF="http://www.ecto.org/garden/">http://www.ecto.org/garden/</A>

        IED's stunning E-text, "The Garden", in an HTML format done by woj.
        Drawback:  Still heavily under construction.

[And again...]

     Under the Ivy:
        <A  HREF="http://area51.upsu.plym.ac.uk/~garrick/kate_bush.html">http://area51.upsu.plym.ac.uk/~garrick/kate_bush.html</A>

        Info about Homeground and gatherings of KateFans.  Unfortunately, the
        nice scans of Top Of The Pops had to be taken down.  But the pictures
        are not lost, here's their new home: [GT]

        <A  HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~calle/KaTe/">http://www.lysator.liu.se/~calle/KaTe/</A>

        They can also be found in a shockwave movie at No Dead Trees:

        <A  HREF="http://www.acy.digex.net/~dobenson/benson.html">http://www.acy.digex.net/~dobenson/benson.html</A>

[New home for the pictures]

     New And Therefore Not Yet Rated By Stev0 Pages:

     The Kate Bush VRML site:
        <A  HREF="http://fly.hiwaay.net/~cbullard/index.htm">http://fly.hiwaay.net/~cbullard/index.htm</A>.

        You need a Netscape browser with a Live3D plug in for these four
        virtual reality worlds there.  These pages need a while to load over
        the net, because they're quite big. [LB]

[Stev0! I need a review! ;-) ]
