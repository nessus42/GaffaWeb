&gt;In article &lt;Pine.3.89.9603241954.A19667-0100000@post.cis.smu.edu&gt;, jdwalker@post.cis.smu.edu ("John D. Walker") writes:
&gt;|&gt; Well, 
&gt;|&gt; she still makes great records, so it works for her, I guess, but knowing 
&gt;|&gt; what live performance has done for me over the years I can't even imagine 
&gt;|&gt; what she'd be doing had she not retired from the stage.
&gt;|&gt; 
&gt;|&gt; Let's face it, folks, Kate is a control freak.  Her whole creative 
&gt;|&gt; process is very insulated and meticulous.
&gt;
&gt;There might be other reasons for this as well. :-)
&gt;
&gt;Never having met Kate, but combining the facts that I've read and 
&gt;adding a some speculation, I have made a hypothesis that she
&gt;actually does not enjoy confronting a lot of people at the same
&gt;time.  Rather she finds it tiresome.

   May I suggest that you need to watch more video of Kate. 
Look at the end of the _Hammersmith Odean_ show...it was one of
the last shows of the tour, and she's hopping up and down, waving
to the audience with her entire body.

   A more recent example is the 1990 KBC/Homeground Convention.
She sat on a couch and talked to everyone in the audience for quite
some time. Of course it was a room completely packed with people
who loved her unreservedly, but it was still a large room full of people.

&gt;She can still be good at it - when judging from the audience side,
&gt;but herself still feel inadequate or just exhausted from the effort.

   She *can* be wary, but in the _Kate Bush On Tour_ video she 
was interviewed after coming off stage. She was practically glowing
with excitement. She really appeared to energised by the audience.

   I'm firmly of the opinion that she enjoyed the *experience* of
the tour and performing. But one thing that comes through clearly
in the _On Tour_ video is this: she was trying to maintain a level
of control on all aspects of the tour that she really did not appear
ready to handle. The tour happened, and it was an amazing thing.
But she was simply exhusted, not by the performance, but by
all the other details.
