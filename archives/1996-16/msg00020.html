&gt; Thanks to all for any information you've got - I appreciate it.

I can't help, sorry...I haven't seen that 2-CD set.

&gt; Just to make this post a bit longer:  I found at least four and maybe six different
&gt; titles for Happy Rhodes and four for Jane Siberry.  Now the problem is that
&gt; I've never, to my knowledge, heard either of their music but you all have
&gt; spoken rather highly of each.  Any recommendations on a title to start with?
&gt; And, just 'cause I'm curious, why?

Why recommend a certain title over another?  Or why are these
artists spoken highly of?

I can only speak for myself, but I consider these two women to be
in the same "sphere" of goddesshood as Kate.  Of course, I've
said it before and I'll say it forever: KATE *IS* GOD. Always
and forever (amen). But in my world, Jane is Jesus and Happy
is the Holy Ghost :-). (Tori's Mary Magdaline, Sarah and Sinead
and others are apostles-apologies if that offends anyone.)

Beyond all this diety doo dah, I love strong, talented, intelligent
women who make music that matters, music that lasts, music I'll
never get tired of, and who write interesting lyrics that *mean*
something.

What to get?

For Happy, if they have one called "RhodeSongs" - get it. It's a
compilation and will give you a good overview of what she sounds
like.  It also has non-album, remixed and acoustic things that
will make sure the CD doesn't become redundant if you decide
that you're madly in love with Happy's music and must rush out
and buy every single thing she's ever released. Which you may. :-)

If they don't have RhodeSongs, close your eyes, reach in, and
grab one. They're all wonderful in my NVHO.

Jane is much harder to choose an album for. They're all very
wonderful too, but each is in a very different style, and
it's hard to know what people will like. My favorites are
"The Walking" and "When I Was A Boy" but they're also her
most "inaccessable" albums, and may take many listenings
to even begin to get into. Then again, maybe not. I've been
a Jane fan since 1984, and I love them all.
