Given all of the interviews that have been postend over the past few
months, I thought it might be interesting to discuss what we would
do if *we* were given the opportunity to interview her.  Doug Alan
is the only love-hound I know that has had such a chance.  So, to
start the ball rolling, these are some of the questions I would ask:

1. I heard that Klaus Kinski is your favorite actor [this was mentioned
   in one of the love-hounds digests around 1985].  Have you ever thought 
   of writing a song which could incorporate him into a video?

2. In one of your interviews ([in Pulse, around Dec 1985]) you mentioned 
   that Hounds of Love is "your lightest album, and the easiest for you
   emotionally".  What did you mean by that?  [I can understand why she
   would consider The Dreaming to be emotionally draining (it's a masterpiece), 
   and I can also understand it for The Kick Inside since that was her first.  
   I'm not sure why she would consider Hounds of Love easier for her than
   Never For Ever or Lionheart].

3. You've sung several traditional songs on your albums (e.g., My Lagan Love,
   The Handsome Cabin Boy).  Do you have any favorite traditional songs that
   you haven't recorded yet?

4. Have you ever thought of recording a Jazz album?  Maybe something in
   collaboration with Donald Fagin?

5. You've mentioned in earlier interview that you don't really know what
   the song "Love and Anger" is about.  I think the juxtiposition is a very
   interesting one.  We sometimes feel that greatest anger at the people 
   we love.  They are the ones who know our feelings most closely, and 
   can hurt us the most if they want to.  But love also involves a sense
   of trust and allowing yourself to be vulnerable.  Do you have any 
   comments about the relationship of these emotions?

6. Near the end of "Love and Anger" you say something that I can't make out.
   Something like "? and Jet" or "? and Jest".  Can you tell me what you are
   saying?

7. Which Beatles songs are your favorites?

8. Have you ever thought of singing a song in Gaellic?

9. I very much enjoy the ethnic music you incorporate in your albums (Irish,
   Bulgarian, Australian).  What do you think of Middle-Eastern music or
   African or Indian?  Can we look forward to any of those styles appearing
   on an upcoming album?

10. I know that John Carder Bush has written lyrics to some of your songs.  Do 
    your brothers ever have any influence on your own lyrics?

11. Eric Idle was the host during your appearance on Saturday Night Live, and
    you've sung the title song for Terry Gilliam's film `Brazil'.  Can you
    tell us anything about your association with Monty Python?  How did you
    meet them?  Are there any hopes of `Brazil' being released?
    [Kate has mentioned Monty Python a few times in her interviews.  For example,
     she noted that Time Bandits is one of her favorite movies.  I also wonder 
     if `Waking the Witch' was influenced by the scene from `Monty Python and The 
     Holy Grail', where they try to dunk the person to see if she's a witch.]

12. How do you feel about bootleg recordings?  Some artists don't seem to
    mind them very much (e.g., Peter Gabriel, Paul McCartney).  There 
    has been a lot of discussion over some bootleg recordings of yours
    called "The Cathy Demos".  Many of your fans feels have mixed feelings 
    about these songs being bootlegged.  On the one hand we feel the
    songs are terrific, but we also don't want to make you upset. 

13. Finally, What is your favorite colour? 
    [asked with the proper intonation, i.e., the emphasis on "what"!]


Well, that's a start!
