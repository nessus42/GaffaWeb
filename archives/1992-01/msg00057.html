MISSING INTERVIEWS 
------------------ 
        Following are lists of interviews that I do not have access to. 
The list of missing print interviews is based on the bibliography and 
medialog published in "Homeground".  The list of missing radio interviews is 
based on the medialog section of "Homeground."  The list of missing 
television interviews is based on a list from "The Garden".  The list of 
radio interivews is incomplete as it does NOT include interviews prior to 
1983..  Any help in obtaining these interviews, or more information, would  
be appreciated! 
 
 
MISSING PRINT INTERVIEWS

        This list is based on the bibliography and medialog published in

MISSING RADIO INTERVIEWS 
------------------------ 
        This list is based on Homeground's "Media Log".  I don't have access 
to the first five issues so this list does NOT include pre-1983 interviews,

probably the same as the "unknown" interviews listed above.

              from his 'In Other Words' material, with additional interview
