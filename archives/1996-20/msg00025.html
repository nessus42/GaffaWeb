Yes, that superstition has been around for centuries.  I remember when a
friend of mine started dating a fellow in 1981 and then decided to marry
him, I told her to watch out because his eyebrows met, and that meant he
was a werewolf. ;)  Turns out he's not SO very bad, but she hasn't been
exactly happy with him.  I don't, however, think that he's been eating
small children or anything.  Another way to tell if someone's a werewolf is
if they have hair on the palms of their hands.

&gt;BTW, Paperhouse and Company of Wolves are my favourite films,

What excellent taste you have! :)  I strongly supsect that, cult film or
no, Paperhouse has probably still been seen in Britain far more than it has
here in America, if only because it's a British film to begin with.  If I
could, I would make sure every person in every land got to see this movie.
It's not always easy to find here, mostly because it isn't very well known.
This is a crime.

Just as a little aside to this, when my mother and I watched Paperhouse
together, even though she and I are both pretty heavy anglophiles (knowing
in our souls that we were born on this continent by mistake), we were
baffled by what "snogging" meant.  Fortunately, I have a wonderful British
English/American English dictionary, and the question was quickly solved.
What a funny word! Since, I've heard it in tons of other shows (AbFab most
recently).   But I suppose "necking" is sort of funny, too, isn't it?  Yes,
well.
