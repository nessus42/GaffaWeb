&gt;
&gt;Yes, that superstition has been around for centuries.  I remember when a
&gt;friend of mine started dating a fellow in 1981 and then decided to marry
&gt;him, I told her to watch out because his eyebrows met, and that meant he
&gt;was a werewolf. ;)  Turns out he's not SO very bad, but she hasn't been
&gt;exactly happy with him.  I don't, however, think that he's been eating
&gt;small children or anything.  Another way to tell if someone's a werewolf is
&gt;if they have hair on the palms of their hands.
&gt;
My eyebrows have always met in the middle and I'm sick of being
accused of being a werewolf. I'm a vegetarian. Although that would
explain all the bloody footprints leading to my house after a full
moon. :-)
No hair on the palms of my hands, yet. And I'm not looking before
anyone tries that old 'sign of madness' joke.
&gt;&gt;BTW, Paperhouse and Company of Wolves are my favourite films,
&gt;
&gt;What excellent taste you have! :)  I strongly supsect that, cult film or
&gt;no, Paperhouse has probably still been seen in Britain far more than it has
&gt;here in America, if only because it's a British film to begin with.  If I
&gt;could, I would make sure every person in every land got to see this movie.
&gt;It's not always easy to find here, mostly because it isn't very well known.
&gt;This is a crime.
&gt;
It's not very well known over here either. I've not actually managed
to get a copy on tape. I'll have to try harder. It's been ages since
I've seen it.
I've got Company of Wolves though and it still amazes me.
&gt;Just as a little aside to this, when my mother and I watched Paperhouse
&gt;together, even though she and I are both pretty heavy anglophiles (knowing
&gt;in our souls that we were born on this continent by mistake), we were
&gt;baffled by what "snogging" meant.  Fortunately, I have a wonderful British
&gt;English/American English dictionary, and the question was quickly solved.
&gt;What a funny word! Since, I've heard it in tons of other shows (AbFab most
&gt;recently).   But I suppose "necking" is sort of funny, too, isn't it?  Yes,
&gt;well.
&gt;
I must admit I used to be puzzled by the term 'necking' for a little
while. You hear it in so many films that I soon realised exactly what
it was. The main problem which caused the confusion was probably the
fact that there are a lot of cult vampire films, so when I heard it in
them I got a tad confused.
I thought that there was an American version of AbFab, or do you
actually get both (I heard the same about Red Dwarf). We get a dismal
English version of Married With Children which isn't a patch on the
original.
