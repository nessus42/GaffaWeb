&gt;&gt;Neither of those are KB songs. They are a couple of lesser examples of
&gt;&gt;Lennon/McCartney craft (am I the only one that finds many of KB's cover
&gt;&gt;choices to be dreadful and unimaginative?).
&gt;
&gt;Most likely these particular songs were not Kate's choice, but were
&gt;requested by the producers of the Japanese television show Sound In S, for
&gt;a Beatles tribute episode on which Kate appeared in June 1978, the source
&gt;of the bootlegged recordings in question.  I wonder: left entirely to her
&gt;own devices, would Kate cover Tomorrow Never Knows or Across The Universe?

Given the infrequency of her TV appearances, you'd think she'd want to make
the MOST, rather than the LEAST, of them. I would also like to cast a very
strong vote for TNK as a cover (brilliant choice)...and against ATU.
Instead, I'd like to her KB do "Cry Baby Cry".

&gt;In fact, it's difficult to pass judgements on Kate's choice of cover
&gt;versions, because she mostly seems to have done them on outside request for
&gt;special projects.  I certainly can't fault her for choosing "The Man I
&gt;Love" or "Rocket Man."   (On the other hand, I've always hated "Candle In
&gt;The Wind.")  But if you have a problem with her joining Peter Gabriel on
&gt;Roy Harper's "Another Day" I shall have to ask you to step outside.

It's funny. I never liked CITW until I heard KB do it. I think Elton John
has been pretty abysmal in his post-Madman phase. If I had my choice, I'd
rather hear KB do Paul McCartney's "Another Day".

&gt;&gt;"She's Leaving Home" is on The Beatles "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
&gt;&gt;Band," a ground-breaking, but uneven, album that you should probably own,
&gt;&gt;anyway.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;"The Long and Winding Road" is on the production-flawed "Let It Be" album
&gt;&gt;by The Beatles. Someday, they'll put out the original "Get Back" version
&gt;&gt;and the earth can properly spin on its axis again.
&gt;
&gt;I believe the "Get Back" recording of "The Long And Winding Road" is
&gt;included on the Beatles' ANTHOLOGY 3.  Perhaps the recent disruptions in
&gt;global climate are due to the Earth resettling itself in its new orbit?  :-)

I didn't put that as clearly as I should have. The disruption won't be
cured until the ENTIRE "Let It Be" album is dumped and replaced with the
"Get Back" album. Anthology 3 was a start, however, to right this grevious
wrong.
