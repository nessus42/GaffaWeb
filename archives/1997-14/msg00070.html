&gt;	Her stage shows are marked by dry commentary and poetry, 
&gt;her own offbeat tunes, medleys of Bowie songs and, as of last 
&gt;Wednesday night, Kate's "Wow." As a matter of fact -- she opened 
&gt;and closed the show with it!
&gt;
&gt;	I could kick myself for not taping it. Her version was 
&gt;stunning. She began with a breathy vocal -- like Kate's -- but 
&gt;lit into the chorus like a wailing cat, with blazing Bowie-esque 
&gt;guitars and slamming drums behind her. And when the song wound 
&gt;down (at the point where Kate sings toni-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yight), 
&gt;Ann did the same, ad nauseum, until she was perfectly mimicking 
&gt;the sound of an annoying bug. Then with a quick snatch into 
&gt;midair, she put an end to "the bug" and the song, all to our 
&gt;great amusement.
&gt;
&gt;	The reprise came at an appropriate time. She'd just done 
&gt;a medley of songs by a talented -- but failed -- artist named 
&gt;Jobriath. Supposedly he was a Bowie wannabe who professed to 
&gt;be "truly bisexual" and whose two albums couldn't live up to the 
&gt;hype produced by his rich lover. Tying in with the failed 
&gt;actors/artists theme (and movie "queens"), Ann told the audience 
&gt;we were all "fantastic" "unbelievable" and "amazing" (which, I 
&gt;think, goes to show she knows more about Kate than just a few of 
&gt;her songs) and then ripped into the reprise.

Double WOW!!! I'm a huge fan of Jobriath. I remember at the time he was
considered a Bowie wannabe. To me his style was quite different than
Bowie's. His 2 LPs were wonderful and I still listen to them, but I think he
was closer in style to the Stones and Gershwin. Well crafted rock/pop songs
with a Broadway flair. He wrote some wonderful love songs (Heartbeat,
Inside, Be Still). I did get a chance to see him (in Hollywood yet) at the
Troubador. I didn't think anybody had heard of him...thought I was the only
one. ;-) BTW, sadly he died about a year ago.

So Robb how is her CD? Is it available? Does she do any Jobriath or Bowie on
it? Is Wow on it?

Fan-tastic!
Wayne
