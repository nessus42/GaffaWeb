One-word capsule review: oooh-ooh-what-a-*great*-concert!

Well, I think Kate Bush has a contender for the nicest-person-in-the-world
award -- Natalie Merchant, the vocalist of 10,000 Maniacs.  No, cancel
that.  Let's have a new award -- the nicest *band* in the world.

They came on stage, said hello, and Natalie sang a few bars of an
Irish-sounding folk song, a capella.  I didn't write down the names of the
other songs, but they were mostly from the new album.  There were only two
songs I didn't recognize.  One of these was a reggae song that lasted for 15
minutes, and showed that this is a *versatile* band who are good musicians.
Natalie read from a book for this song, and the words fit amazingly well.  I
couldn't find out the title of the book; does anyone know?

Band setup:  singer, drummer, bassist, rhythm guitarist, lead guitarist.

The lead guitarist had a really unique style of playing.  It appears as if
he learned how to play mandolin before guitar, because he plays the guitar
in the same fast-strumming way as a mandolin is played.  The amazing thing
is that it actually sounds like a mandolin!  He had a large rack of effects
which made his guitar sound very strange, and unlike a guitar at all.  Only
once did I see him actually play a guitar chord.

At one point, Natalie picked up a notebook she had and showed the audience
little sketches that she had done.  There was one of a palm tree in
California that she had drawn when they played there, and one of a dog.

When they finished their set, most of the band came up to the mic and said
`thank you' and `goodbye.'  They got an encore, and played three more songs.

The opening band was 11th Hour, and reminded me of REM and various other
bands of that nature.  They were ok, except most of the songs sounded
too similar.  They did a great Christmas medley.

The only thing I didn't like about the whole concert was the normal
asshole-drunk-jock crowd that usually shows up for these.  I guess I can't
complain too much about them, cuz they obviously have good taste in music,
but still...  They guy behind me kept yelling and talking to people while
the bands were playing.

If 10,000 Maniacs plays *anywhere* near you, go see them.  You'll be glad
you did.  They are still on their tour, but will be playing again in the New
York/Boston area in February.
