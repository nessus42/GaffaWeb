&gt; I have to disagree with you on this. I like to hear about other female
&gt; singers who have a similar sound to Kate.I happen to like female 
&gt; singers who have a high voice and sing near pitch as you say.
&gt; 
&gt; So if anyone else hears a singer who reminds you of Kate, please post 
&gt; it so the rest of us can check her out.

I have no problem with your request for postings from like-minded people. 
It's just that so many people have mentioned singers and said they "have a
similar sound to Kate," and they all sound boring to me.

&gt; &gt;  As for that popular refrain, "You like KaTe, so
&gt; &gt;  you gotta like X," well, I think Sportin' Life got it right:   
&gt; &gt; "It ain't necessarily so."  
&gt; 
&gt; I did not say that. Try reading a post before you touch you keyboard. 
&gt; ( I wish I could of said before you open your mouth, but hey!)

Sorry to get you all r'iled up; it's true that you didn't emit the refrain;
you only reminded me of it by saying that Sarah is "a Kate Bush
sound-a-like." 

&gt; &gt;   (b) you haven't really heard KaTe's singing. 
&gt; 
&gt; Sonny, When I bought Kate's first album, it was the only one out. Now
&gt; go away and try to be nice to people for a change.

Now you're the one who's replying without reading the post.  My posting
said 
  "I have to think (a)... (b)... "
because the way you compared Sarah with KaTe made me think you were saying
they were the same.   (Ma always did say I was too literal minded.)  

I don't like being called "Sonny," but maybe I deserve it for taking your
statement farther than you (apparently) intended.  I don't think KaTe fans
should flame at each other.  Can we call a truce?
