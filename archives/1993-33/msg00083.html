Hi

48 seconds... that's all Paul King showed of the new Rubberband Girl video on
MTV First Look. Why didn't they show the complete thing? Why? WHY?!???

Well, then 48 seconds have to suffice for the moment!

First a statement I think I have to make: Rubberband Girl in fact sounds
much better in hifi than it did in 8kHz 8bit mono soundfile. So much better
that I think I'll start liking the song. Better: loving the song. Kate - your
voice is as beautiful as ever, that really was the low-fi.

Now to the video: Kate looks great, she's dancing with some male dancer
who moves more or less exactly the way she does. Some of the movements Kate
puts her feet onto the feet of the dancer and so they move synchronously.
Looks funny. Looks great. Did I say that Kate looks great too? Yes I did.
But it's true. No. It's not enough: She looks gorgeous! In the background
a lot of musicians play a various mixture of instruments, as far as I could
see Prince was not inbetween them, even if he was audible on BVs and guitar
in the 48 seconds they showed. Well, probably Prince was too busy with his
tour to appear in the video. Have I said before that I think the video
is great? Yes? Doesn't matter, it can be said repeatedly...

[rewind, play again...] Aaaahhhhh!!! finally!

Ah yes, Paul King still thinks that the album will be released on October 4th,
but he was wrong last time too... Let's just hope it will stay October 4th!
At least in the UK.

[rewind, play again...] Aaaaahhhhhh!!!! FINALLY!

Actually the male dancer behind her leads her arms and legs through the dance.
Almost like if Kate were a GIRL puppet fixed with some RUBBERBAND to him.

[rewind, play again...] AAAAHHHHH!!! FINALLY!!!

HEY! Wouldn't that be my first song interpretation! And one that's not
questionable!

[rewind, play again...] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! FINALLY!!!!!!!!!

Well, come to think of it, her body is also stripped to the male dancer's body.

[rewind, play again...] turning up volume
[rewind, play again...] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...

KATE! Why don't you tour? Looking good and feeling fit for dancing through a
tour?

[rewind, play again...]
