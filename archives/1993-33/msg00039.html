1) Eat The Music

Lots of fun, very bouncy and cute. Trivial, but I like it. I think it
might be the first song on the album that I get tired of, but for now
I don't mind hearing it over and over again.

2) ETM (extended)

Extended triviality, but I like it too. 

3) Big Stripey Lie

*Very* cool! Even though I don't much care for the drum machine sound, I'll
get over it, just because everything else about the song is interesting.
I especially like the violin. I assume it's Nigel Kennedy....sighyummy.

4) Candle In The Wind

I *LOVE* this version!!! I've loved it since I first heard it on the
"Rocket Man" CD single. I could listen to it over and over and over
again. The music, the keyboards, remind me of Tony Bank's first solo
album _A Curious Feeling_ and maybe that's why I love it so much. The
background vocals are lush and ethereal, and the forground vocal is
plaintive and poignant. When Kate sings "...all the press were hounding
you" it's sung with such empathy and force that it gives me chills. Kate
knows all about being hounded by the press (before Di came along Kate
was the most photographed woman in England) and yet she didn't have it
a fraction as bad as Marilyn. I definitely hear this as a tribute to
*Marilyn* rather than just a tribute to Elton John's song. I love listening
to this song on headphones because the music and background vocals swirl
around and fade in and out in an almost disorienting way. That slightly
edgy yet lush arrangement, plus Kate's alternating melodic/clipped way
of singing adds up to (for me) a very haunting and disorienting song,
which seems quite perfect since Marilyn's life was haunting and dis-
orienting. I love it, I simply, honestly, love it.
