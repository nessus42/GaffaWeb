&gt;I feel compelled to interpret the song in light of this cover.

Now that you've suggested it, I did the same thing, and came up with
something else.  Read on...

&gt; This song is about a man who's involved with an obsessed, abusive 
&gt; woman.  The relationship is unhealthy for him, and leaves him
&gt; drained.
&gt;        "Split me open with devotion,
&gt;         you put your hands in and rip my heart out.  
&gt;         Does he conceal what he really feels?"
&gt; Like too many women in abusive relationships, he lacks the empowerment
&gt; to change the situation.
&gt;        "He's a woman at heart
&gt;         and I love him for that.
&gt;         Let's split him open
&gt;         Like a pomegranate
&gt;         Insides out."  
&gt; I can't decide whether the next line is intended to suggest 
&gt; physical abuse, or is just metaphorical: 
&gt;        "All is revealed
&gt;         Not only women bleed."

&gt;She's singing "A song of seeds, the food of love", but I can't imagine
&gt;phrases like "split me open", "rip my heart out", and "rip them to 
&gt;pieces with sticky fingers" meaning anything positive about love.  
&gt;The ugliness of the butchered fruit and the woman's hand clawing
&gt;into the melon on the cover tends to reinforce my conviction that
&gt;this is *not* a pretty song.  The bouncy caribbean beat lends 
&gt;wry irony to these dark lyrics.

Yikes...you know, I reread this, and you may be right anyway.  My idea was
that the cover looks childlike...the glee of ripping up fruit and spraying
juice everywhere...the sort of joy-in-messiness that motivates watergun
fights, food fights, etc.  So I was wondering if it was a sort of delight in
opening up someone who's closed in on himself.

But maybe not.

&gt;Someone please convince me I'm dead wrong on this.  

I can't disprove you (yet).  Check the envelope (rope, Hall, Mr. Green).
