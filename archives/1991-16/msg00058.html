&gt;From: barger@aristotle.ils.nwu.edu (Jorn Barger)
&gt;Subject: Do you dream of Kate? (silly)
&gt;
&gt;My _ex_ once dreamt that Kate reassured her she wouldn't steal me away (!),
&gt;but I just had my first Katedream last night, and it was a doozy.  I had
&gt;tickets to her tour, which turned out to be in a TINY (50-seat)
&gt;theater-in-the-round in somebody's mansion.  Kate was sitting there
&gt;nervously as people entered, and I went over and squeezed her hand to
&gt;reassure her, but she seemed worried everyone would line up to paw her if
&gt;they saw.  I regretted not bringing a tape recorder.
&gt;
&gt;After the first set (which I can't remember anything about), I had to go do
&gt;something that required my leaving the hall, and to get back in time I
&gt;risked my life running across a four-lane highway.  In fact I'd missed the
&gt;first song of the second set, which sounded like Kashka (maybe), and Kate
&gt;was now wearing this incredible beautiful hideous latex monster outfit,
&gt;which by squeezing and stretching and shimmying she transformed into a
&gt;totally different multi-colored big ragmopdoll costume, to great applause. 
&gt;(I think this part came from the Muppet-Shop rumor.)
&gt;
&gt;After the concert I saw Kate again outside, and gave her a hug, and she
&gt;apologized for the bodyguards who were eyeing me threateningly, saying
&gt;something about how she was in danger of getting "carried away," like I was
&gt;turning her on(!).  During this part she actually looked more like Krys of
&gt;Homeground (who I've met) than KT herself.
&gt;
&gt;There was a big stone slab with the tour schedule carved into it-- four
&gt;dates only in England, but some 30 in the US, of which this one, labelled
&gt;"Buffalo Evening News" (I used to live in Bflo) was about #9.
&gt;
&gt;(Was this worth posting?)

     You know, about a month ago I had a Kate dream:

     The setting was Kate's wedding, which took place in a large cathedral.
This wedding was special in that she invited fans to attend and was going to
perform after the ceremony.  So she gets married (in a traditional white
dress) and then goes to change into a long, blood red, dress for the
performance.  
     But get this.  In the dream, I was in the ** third ** row of pews.  Guess
who was in the ** first ** row--yes, IED was in the first row!  Even in _my_
dream, he got a front row seat!  Well, I guess it goes to show that dreams
must conform to reality on some level.
     So later Kate comes out in the red dress and starts singing (a song that
I apparently made up as she sang, as I'd never heard it before) on a circular
stage to the left of the alter.  I then walk to the back of the church and 
then go up a side hallway, which is the access to the stage.  I then watch
her performance from behind the stage.
