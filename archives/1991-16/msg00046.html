Sauron responds to Drukman:


&gt;I had heard the song *without* owning the CD.  Difficult concept, I
&gt;know...

Now, now, Jon was just having fun.  I will point out that you have already
stated that KaTe is you favorite female singer; with a mere 6 studio
albums it's not *too* hard to have all of them.  

On the other hand, it *is* possible that Columbia has switched the packaging
of the TSW LP from a lyrics-on-paper sleeve to one of the generic white
paper or clear plastic sleeves.  A perfectly reasonable question.


&gt;&gt;Oh dear lord, grant me the strength...
&gt;
&gt;Sorry.  As I said, I was previously unaware of this group's existence.
&gt;I (apparently mistakenly) thought I could get some of my questions about
&gt;my favorite female singer answered.  I thought, since everyone here is a
&gt;fan, such a question, while probably repetetive, would not be totally
&gt;inappropriate.

Wrong.  You were *not* mistaken; your questions *were* answered.  In
fact, they were answered pretty well (if I do say so myself) considering
the FAQ nature.  Perhaps what's innappropriate is throwing a tantrum
when not everyone answers the way you want.

&gt;&lt;Wads of strange stuff (constituting roughly 10 times more verbal diarrhea
&gt;than my original posting) deleted.&gt;

Yeah, but it was *funny*.  No waste of bandwidth there.

&gt;&gt;Actually, I lied.  It's a kind of gaffer's tape which is like duct tape
&gt;&gt;only she couldn't just come out and say "duct tape" because then we
&gt;&gt;wouldn't have endless arguments on L-H that run like this:

This too was funny.

&gt;I already know that.  Somebody less uptight answered.

Yup.  And he was never even thanked.

Druk posted one of the funniest things I've seen in .gaffa in a long time.
Okay, maybe it was "in" humor.  It was still hysterical, and it's the
kind of thing I wish we had more of in the times like these when there
hasn't been an album for a while (1.5 years since TSW came out!) and
there's little going on wrt KaTe other than idle speculations about
her possible tour and work with Prince.  Of course, there's nothing
wrong with all the talk about Happy Rhodes that's been flying around!
