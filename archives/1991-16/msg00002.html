My _ex_ once dreamt that Kate reassured her she wouldn't steal me away (!),
but I just had my first Katedream last night, and it was a doozy.  I had
tickets to her tour, which turned out to be in a TINY (50-seat)
theater-in-the-round in somebody's mansion.  Kate was sitting there
nervously as people entered, and I went over and squeezed her hand to
reassure her, but she seemed worried everyone would line up to paw her if
they saw.  I regretted not bringing a tape recorder.

After the first set (which I can't remember anything about), I had to go do
something that required my leaving the hall, and to get back in time I
risked my life running across a four-lane highway.  In fact I'd missed the
first song of the second set, which sounded like Kashka (maybe), and Kate
was now wearing this incredible beautiful hideous latex monster outfit,
which by squeezing and stretching and shimmying she transformed into a
totally different multi-colored big ragmopdoll costume, to great applause. 
(I think this part came from the Muppet-Shop rumor.)

After the concert I saw Kate again outside, and gave her a hug, and she
apologized for the bodyguards who were eyeing me threateningly, saying
something about how she was in danger of getting "carried away," like I was
turning her on(!).  During this part she actually looked more like Krys of
Homeground (who I've met) than KT herself.

There was a big stone slab with the tour schedule carved into it-- four
dates only in England, but some 30 in the US, of which this one, labelled
"Buffalo Evening News" (I used to live in Bflo) was about #9.

(Was this worth posting?)

 It really hurts, Vitya.  We're really screwed up."
Aleksandr Akimov, shift foreman at Chernobyl ("He had received a dose of
1,500 roentgen, perhaps more, and was doomed.  His skin turned darker and
darker, and on the day of his death he was black as a Negro." His
radioactive body was buried in a soldered lead coffin.)
