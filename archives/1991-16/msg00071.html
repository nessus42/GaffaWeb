&gt;From: fnord@spdcc.com (Dan Schaeffer)
&gt;(1) Is there any news about any forthcoming tour, and if so, are there any
&gt;    details?
&gt;
&gt;(2) What's the word on a new album?  I just got back from Alaska, and I have
&gt;    yet to get into a record store....

There is no more news about a tour. As far as anyone knows it is still
planned but no dates have been announced. Work on the new album is also
going ahead and Kate has been in the studio but again no release date
has been confimred.

&gt;&gt;Actually, I lied.  It's a kind of gaffer's tape which is like duct tape
&gt;&gt;only she couldn't just come out and say "duct tape" because then we
&gt;&gt;wouldn't have endless arguments on L-H that run like this:
&gt;
&gt;I already know that.  Somebody less uptight answered.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;OK.  Who put the phenobarbitol in my herbal tea?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I dunno... same person who pissed in your cornflakes?

Patrick - people have been know to insert some humorous content into
their postings. This often helps to make reading the answer to a
perennial question somewhat less mind-numbing than usual.
There was no personal antagonism in Jon's posting.


&gt;From: Richard Frost &lt;rfrost@spam.ua.oz.au&gt;
&gt;Subject: Has KaTe read News &amp; Oz KaTemas
&gt;  Has KaTe ever heard of USENET and or this group? I know that the
&gt; love-hounds presented a bunch of flowers to her at the last convention
&gt; but has she ever read News?

It is a little known fact that Kate spends most of her time reading
News. In fact this is the real reason why it takes her so long to
produce each album. Hit the k key Kate!

&gt;  SHALL we DONATE a COMPUTER to KaTe on behalf of the love-hounds,
&gt; maybe we could get her an account on an English University's computer?

Kate is always welcome to drop by and use my account. Never seems to
bother though :-)
