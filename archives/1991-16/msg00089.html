&gt; The whole point of my converting my KaTe scans from the IFF format to the
&gt; GIF format is so that all of you PC folks can enjoy them, if there is
&gt; any such thing as a _standard_ PC screen format that everyone would like to
&gt; see them in please let me know...

I work in a unix/Xwindows environment and GIF is a format that works
well for us. Kate looking straight at me from the "Sensual World"
album cover is a knockout - and the texture in the rose petals is amazing.

Doug Alan writes

&gt;&gt; [Kate:] Yes, who else is there, really?  But I would really hate anyone to
&gt;&gt;    be offended by the song.  It's not meant to be a glorification of
&gt;&gt;    that whole event.  It's just meant to be an exploration of the idea
&gt;&gt;    that evil quite often appears in a charming guise, and we should
&gt;&gt;    all be careful.  He fooled so many people, and I don't think you 
&gt;&gt;    can blame them for being fooled.
&gt;
&gt; I get really annoyed everytime I see Kate saying this!  Of course you
&gt; can blame the people he "fooled".  You can and should blame every
&gt; single one of the bastards that let Hitler act out his awful scheme!
&gt; Hitler wasn't to blame; he was insane.  You can't blame someone for
&gt; being insane.  It was all of the sane people who turned their eyes
&gt; away and quietly let it all happen who are to blame.  Those and the
&gt; greedy people who saw a chance to better their lives at the expense of
&gt; others.

Sounds *slightly* hypocritical doesn't it - what are *you* (or I)
doing to prevent the wrongs of *your* (or my) government. Do you live
in the United States ? What are *you* doing to prevent your government
undermining democratically elected governments in Chile (and trying it
in Australia), supporting and then denouncing puppet governments
(Noreiga (sp?), Marcos ...) in any number of countries, selling arms
to Iran in violation of laws set by it's own congress, or perhaps the
gross exploitation of third world countries by Western governments and
corporations - how much do *we* profit by this exploitation ?

My government currently sells Uranium to the French, who keep letting
off A-Bombs in the South Pacific, and who never even apologized for
sinking "The Rainbow Warrior" in the harbour of a "friendly" nation!

*Every* nation has it's big pile of skeletons in the cupboard and most
people are completely removed from the political process, and perceive
that the problems are "too big" and that they can't do anything to
change them ( they have to pay for the rent/mortgage/shiny new
car/shiny new stereo/.... and are too busy "surviving" to have time to
"change the world").

Why do you expect the people of Germany in the 1930's or whoever else
you are blaming to be any more noble in this regard than the vast
majority of your contemporaries ? We, at least have their historical
example as a guide.


Please send reply's via email - my guess is that most Love-Hounds
would rather discuss music...

	Guy - and I haven't even had my morning coffee yet :-)

&lt;standard disclaimer, + I like apple pie too&gt;
