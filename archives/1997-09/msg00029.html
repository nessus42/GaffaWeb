&gt;Q:  How many love hounds mail list subscribers does it take
&gt;     to change a light bulb?
&gt;
&gt;A:  1,331:

&lt;snip&gt;

Your examples are a bit generic; they could apply equally well to almost
any newsgroup or mailing list.  In a more Love-Hounds specific vein, you
left out:

38 to complain about how long it's been since the last time the light bulb
was changed.
14 to declare they are no longer interested in light bulbs because so much
time passes between each changing.
92 to ask if anyone knows when the next light bulb is coming.
64 to list their top five favorite light bulbs.
1 (at least) to compile a master list of favorite light bulbs from all the
top five lists.
88 to say that they can't stand fluorescent lights, and isn't it obvious
that the fluorescent light is just a blatant rip-off of the light bulb.
12 to compile lists of all the similarities between the fluorescent light
and the light bulb.
73 to argue that they like both fluorescent lights and light bulbs, and
they really aren't all that similar after all.
17 to get all huffy and say they are *so* similar!
6 to say they've heard a rumor about nude photos of a light bulb, and ask
if anyone has more details.
11 to insist that wasn't really a nude light bulb, it was just a light bulb
look-alike.
3 to say they saw a picture of a light bulb recently, and it looks a lot
more round than it used to.
7 to take offense at the above and post angry replies which say that only a
fool would care how round a light bulb is.
9 to wonder if light bulbs have something to do with witchcraft.
4 to answer that there's no such thing as witchcraft.
3 to reply that there is so, and accuse the others of bigotry.
8 to try and figure out how many steps it takes to get from Kevin Bacon to
a light bulb.
1 to point out that every film Kevin Bacon ever appeared in includes light
bulbs, so it only takes one step -- thereby proving that he's missed the
whole point of the exercise.
20 to hold "Lightmas" parties every year in various cities to celebrate the
invention of the light bulb.

and finally...

several thousand to be told by the light bulb "You're completely mad, all
of you!"


RAB
(if there's anyone I *haven't* offended in the above list, let me know and
I'll get around to you!)
