&gt;Subject: Re: "This Woman's Work" video
&gt;I forgot to explain WHY this song is was easier to understand
&gt;for American fans than British fans.  The movie She's Having
&gt;A Baby wasn't released in Britain for a long time.  In fact,
&gt;I'm not sure that it was EVER released there, except possibly
&gt;straight onto video.  At least, the Homeground people kept
&gt;telling me that that the release date for that movie was being
&gt;put off for one reason or another.  This must have been HELL
&gt;to British Kate fans, since I doubt the soundtrack album would
&gt;be released for an unreleased movie.

You are right Ed. it was hell. It was even worse when I finally heard
the song many months after the US hounds and realised just how good it
was. As far as I know the film has never been publically released in GB.
I am not certain about a video version as I never rent videos.

&gt;From: nrc@cbema.att.com (Neal R Caldwell, Ii)
&gt;&gt;&gt;   Hi! I found a dealer in Tucson who has new CD copies of "Passing
&gt;Through&gt;&gt;Air" and "If You Could See Me Now" for $35 each. My questions are:
&gt;&gt;&gt;  (1) Are these "must-haves" for KaTe collectors?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;
&gt;But on the other hand, no, not really.  Just wanted to raise my hand
&gt;here and point out that there are still a few of us who are
&gt;uncomfortable with violating Kate's right to control her art and with
&gt;paying someone for something that they have no right to sell.  We have
&gt;managed to get by without these sort of "must-haves" for some time now
&gt;and I imagine that we will continue to do so for some time to come.

While I used to have doubts about buying bootlegs, I fear all my scruples
disappeared after the release of the This Woman's Work box set. As I
paid almost 100 pounds to buy the set which included 6 CDs I had already
bought just to be able to get the rarities, I feel EMI/Kate have not done
too badly. Particularly, as EMI felt like charging full price for
the CDs, some of which were on sale at budget prices in the same racks.
Add to this the fact that the set was very poorly put together e.g. small
CD booklet, no lyrics, no info. etc (c.f. Larry's description of the Japanese
set) then I feel that if a fan is expected to pay this kind of money for
something that has literally been thrown together (and if that is what
Kate *really* wanted then I find it very sad) then he/she cannot be criticised
for wanting to obtain even rarer material by whatever means possible.

Be seeing you,
	Neil
