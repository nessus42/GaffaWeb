First off I was just sent the text to the convention so don't anybody else
send it! 
 
Second off Thanks for all the letters (already!) about Cloudbusting.  I
figured people would be exited but this.... 

Third off, I just had a good idea.  since I already have converted the lyrics
, chronology, and disc/video graphy sections of the Garden and since these are
going to be included with most versions of cloudbusting I might as well start
think about posting em.  I will PROBABLY (unless IED has any objections, as he
has not been able to edit them) start sending them through in as a series of
messages, so if you don't have em' in some form of another, get ready for em. 
Also if anybody else has maassive files (10-20 pages) they want to send
through maybe me should cooridinate so that we don't overload the system. From
what the moderator has told me, I am only going to send through about 20-25k
at a time.  
        Remember these first files are actually IED's scomments about them
should go to him.  Any formating errors caught (extra blank lines, etc) should
be directed towards me.  
 
        Lastly, I just got a color     DRAWING of Kate.  Its from a demo of an
AMIGA program SPECTRACOLOR.  Its not very good, and its only 4 or a screen,
but it's the only DRAWING I can think of.  It came in a magazine/disk
collectioin from England.  The magazine uses the picture itself to illistrate
how to use the demo of the program.  IT shows the picture of Kate
super-impossed over a staircase then the same picture with Kate faded down
somewhat.  The caption in the magazine read "A once superstar who has faded to
 obscurity" or something simular.  I don't know how much of a dig at Kate this
was meant to be and how much it was simply illistrating how to use the fade
features in the program.  I should be able to get the name of the mag if
anybody wants to write em nasty letters.
