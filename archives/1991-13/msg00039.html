Hi Love-Hounds, 

Neal states: 

&gt;...The Japanese edition has 
&gt;clearly been tweaked to make it more attractive to the fans. ... 

I agree with you, Neal.  Especially since the Japanese box came out after 
the UK box.  If the two had come out the same day, I still would have paid
the extra cost for the Japanese box, I know that though.  The Japanese 
indeed do what it takes to be more attractive to the fans. 

But my God, couldn't the English have at *least* put the rarities lyrics 
in their booklets?  Simply inexcusable.  Finally, I've experience the 
sheer eKsTacy of knowing all of what Kate sings.  Stunning lines such as: 

"Who is the funny sex machine?  (KEN)"   Or: 
"It keeps me going and it keeps the ship away."  
"Doo-doo-n-doo-doo-no-doo dow"  (Hey, they couldn't even translate that line)

Lazlo said his Japanese _The Kick Inside_ sounds *glorious*.  YES YES YES, 
doesn't it?  After hearing some of these CDs from my Jap. box, I have to say
that they ALL sound glorious.  Maybe the best-sounding Kate I've heard. 

Lazlo and Jon wanted to know the price.  It would help, wouldn't it? :-) 
I didn't pay by yen, plus I don't know the conversion rate.  Tom at C-Side
charges $164.99, plus $7 p/h; air/insured is an extra $5.  Note that this 
information came from his last KTlist that I've had for at least a month
and a half, so it may even be cheaper or more expensive nowadays.  Steve
Williams said that he saw it yesterday at the Austin Record Show for around
$189.00, but also saw it in _Goldmine_ recently for $159.00 (not counting
p/h if ordered in the mail).  Thanks for calling and offering to pick up 
some KTstuff for me last weekend, Steve!  I can almost guarantee that Tom 
at C-Side will match or better any price you can name.  Those of you 
interested in the Japanese box can call Tom at 813-461-4327 and haggle. 
I advertise for Tom only because I know he is not making very much profit.
He really is a big Kate collector, and will deal if you have something
he's interested in or can resell.   Ahem, I should know.  My raiding of 
HMV stores in London last November during Kon week (sigh..I DO wish my 
license plate would finally arrive) to scarf up the free  mini Q magazines
featuring Kate allowed me to get _quite_ a nice price for my Japanese box.
Hey, you Brits.  Tom'll even take pound notes. :-)  
I should add here that those still looking to buy a box should also 
seriously consider the UK box, because there is currently (and I wouldn't
be surprised if Love-Hounds traffic had something to do with it) a 
price war going on, according to Tom.   He noted in his last KTlist that 
he can now sell it for what he used to pay wholesale for it.  I think 
Jon recently paid a good price for his.   So, shop around! 

"Ooh you rolling matador, 
 Kill in your eyes for the old Tauro
 That shut the door
 To Glory and gore
 The throw of the Rose
 That's all you live for 
 Well, you've lost it all."

Larry (Lion-Heart@cup.portal.com)
