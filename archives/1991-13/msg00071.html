Here is the latest info for John Relph's quick and dirty CD booklet
for _This Woman's Work_ parts I and II.  I have been unable to find or
verify some information.  Please check and correct all information in
brackets "[ ]".  Thank you for your help.  Oh, and I have a few
questions:

What does Kate call her studio?  (And where is it?)

Is it true that _Hounds Of Love_ was recorded at Abbey Road, or does
it just say thanks to Abbey Road for helping get her own studio going?

Are there any notes scratched in the run-off groove on the "Experiment
IV", "Love and Anger", "Running Up That Hill", "Hounds of Love", "This
Woman's Work", or "The Sensual World" 7" singles?
