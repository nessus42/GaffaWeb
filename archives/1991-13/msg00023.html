Oops, already a typo in the subject heading--not a good sign.
IED wants to say that Richard Caldwell is right that IED regrets the
first comments he made to Love-Hounds about Kerry Juby's
_The_Whole_Story_. He was extremely excited (high) when he first
got the book, and that first posting (a positive statement about
the book) was mainly a reflection of that initial euphoria over the
book's appearance. Within a couple of days, however, IED had posted
a much more circumspect and detailed review of the entire book, and
this was basically a negative review. Thereafter a slightly different,
shorter review by IED appeared in _Homeground_, and after that IED 
wrote a _very_ long (i.e., very boring) and line-by-line review of
the book, calling attention to each of the book's nearly 100 out-and-
out errors of fact. This excessive fussiness (even for IED) was
probably prompted as much by embarrassment over IED's initial public
response to the book as by a pure, scholarly interest in truth.
   IED would like to express his excitement over the quality and
quantity of interesting Kate-related text that has appeared in 
Love-Hounds during the last month. Keep it up, folks!
   Isn't Ron Hill's _Cloudbusting_ project an exciting one? IED
is not alone in anticipating the file's release over the coming
weeks. Applause can be heard in the chips in every Love-Hound's
computer as you read this--just listen carefully, it's there. If
you still don't hear it, play "All We Ever Look For" and you'll
be able to make it out--that's the Love-Hounds door she's opening!

   "Ooh, a drug!"
   She is.
