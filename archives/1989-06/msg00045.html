From: bradley!bucc2!pwh@uxc.cso.uiuc.edu (Pete Hartman)

&gt; I really can't say myself, not having the technical equipment to
&gt; play with the sound, but wouldn't it be likely to be in german?
&gt; Especially considering 1) the later passage in (I forget the song)
&gt; "Tiefer, [...]  Is there anyone who knows enough german and has some
&gt; sort of digitizing equipment that could check this out?

I don't know much German, but when I digitized the passage in question
and played it back, it sounded like a load of gibberish, and certainly
not German gibberish.  Besides, Kate's clues say that the first word is
"Don't," which, at last check, was not a German word.

I have arrived at a solution to the mystery message that satisfies me
somewhat, and it was certainly convincing enough so that our
humble pseudo-moderator, at last years Katemas party, slammed his fist
against the concrete and screamed "Goddamit.  You're right!  That *can't*
be right... but it is!"  (sorry for paraphrasing you :&gt;oug, but my memory's
a bit fuzzy)
                   !
	[ Dammit, \!on, that's "|&gt;oug"!!!  NOT ":&gt;oug" -- |&gt;oug ]

I should mention that this interpretation was arrived at with the help
of IED, MarK T. Ganzer (one for the "where are they now?" file,
sadly), and Joe Turner.  I believe IED no longer subscribes to my
theory (although it fits the clues as given by Kate pretty closely).

I am not going to reveal what this solution is, partly to maintain
some sort of mystery about the affair, but mostly because I don't want
to look really stupid when it turns out that I am way off base.

Anyway, figure it out yourself, and if you are REALLY stuck, drop me a
line and I'll tell you what I _think_ it is.  I'll give you a hint,
however: it is NOT backwards.  It is forwards, produced in the same
manner as the "Leave It Open" mystery message.
