Here are the lyrics to _Troy_, as best as I can make them out.
But first, two questions:
1. Can anyone else make out exactly what she sings toward the end
   (where I have the brackets)?
2. What is the connection between Troy and the Phoenix, mythological-wise?
   My roommate is somewhat of an expert in all things ancient, and
   he was puzzled by the juxtaposition of Troy and the Phoenix.

Also, as a feeble stab at why MTV might have claimed that _Troy_
was about Sinead's mother, I notice that the album, _The Lion and The Cobra_,
is dedicated to her mother.

So, without further ado, here are the words:


Troy  (Sinead O'Connor)

I remember it -  Dublin in a rainstorm,
Sitting in the long grass in the Summer, keeping warm.
I remember it -  every restless night,
We were so young then, we thought that everything
   we could possibly do was right.

And we move -  stolen from our very eyes,
And I wonder where you went to.
And tell me, when did the light die?

You will rise, you will return,
The Phoenix from the flame.
You will learn:  you will rise, you will return,
Being what you are, there is no other Troy for you to burn.

And I never meant to hurt you,
I swear I didn't mean those things I said,
I never meant to do that to you,
Next time, I'll keep my hands to myself instead.

Oh, does she love you?
What do you want to do?
Does she need you like I do?

Do you love her?
Is she good for you?
Does she hold you like I do?

Do you want me?
Should I leave?
I know you're always telling me that you want me,
   but just sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't leave.

Oh, I love you.
God, I love you.
I'd kill a dragon for you, and die.

But I will rise, I will return.
The Phoenix from the flame.
I have learned:  I will rise, and you'll see me return,
Being what I am, there is no other Troy for me to burn.

Well, you should have left the light on.
You should have left the light on.
Then I wouldn't have tried, you'd never have known.
Well, I wouldn't have pulled you tighter,
No, I wouldn't have pulled you close,
I wouldn't have screamed, "No! I can't let you go!"
If the door wasn't closed.
No, I wouldn't have pulled you to me,
No, I wouldn't have kissed your face,
You wouldn't have begged me to hold you if
   we hadn't been in there in the first place.

Oh, but I know you wanted me to be there.
Every look that you threw told me so.

But you should have left the light on ...
You should have left the light on ...

[Wouldn't have made a bird away]
But you're still spitting fire.
Makes no difference what you say,
You're still alive.
You're still alive.
You're still alive.
