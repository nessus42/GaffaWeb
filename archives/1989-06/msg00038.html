Folks,

It has been nice to see Love-Hounds back as a semi-regular newsgroup again.
Plesase pardon this short retrospective....

I've been reading LH again for the past few weeks.  I find several thing quite
amazing and I have several questions.  I started actively participating in
this group in late 1985 (early 1986?), reasonably soon after the release of
HoL.  The 3+ years have come and gone quickly.  Yesterday, as I was trying
to figure out how to post directly to LH I also started to contemplate what
this newsgroup did to affect my life.  First, in trying to communicate to
other LHs who were posting regularly here, I managed to wade through the
problems and pitfalls of INTERNER addressing and route debugging.  With the
help of several foreign (to USA) Love Hounds, I was able to determine correct
routings for thre sending of my CV/Resume to universities and research
foundations/hospitals in Australia, New Zeland, Norway, and England.  Through
these efforts, I gained many valuable contacts and potential job opportunities.
This probably was the most significant thing.  Second, on the advice of
people who post here, I added significant ammounts of diversity to the kinds
of music I purchase and listen to.  Through this group, I was exposed to
Depeche MOde, the Cocteau Twins, Diamanda Galas, Robyn Hitchcock, Dead
Kenedys, Sonic Youth, and Madonna (just joking).  There are others also.
Next, as a function of the 1986 KATEmas party at Doug's, I somehow managed to
receive a NET-Reputation as a lush.  Oddly enough, this has kinda followed
me in other NET-adventures in other newsgroups, and has resulted in some
pretty weird party experiences in places where I met people from the net.
I am looking forward to a KAATEmas celebration this year, Will there be one?
Finally, LH provided me with a considerable amount of pleasurable reading
during off times, and, of course, some not so pleasurable reading.

NOw on the question side.  In 3+ years it would seem that most of the
undergraduate LHs have finally finished their degrees and are now experiencing
the 'real world', or have gone on to furhter postpone reality in grad school.
I have noticed that cept for Jon, IED, and Doug (of course), there are few
contributors recently from the early days.  Now, I know there are a number
of LHs who are not students.  Are Hofmann and Wicinski still out there? If
so, get in touch, I might be commming to DC again for a Pentagon meeting.
Finally, a question for IED.. Aren't you about finished with your degree
yet?

At any rate, Its good to see LH back as a regular feature.  Thanks Doug.
