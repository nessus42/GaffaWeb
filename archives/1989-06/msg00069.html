 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick
 Subject: MisK. (mailbag)

      First, a very late addition to the _Cathy_Demos_ tape list:

 134. Tom Rumland &lt;tom@uunet.uu.net&gt;

           *                      *                        *

      From: jsd%UMASS.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu
 &gt;I have arrived at a solution to the mystery message that satisfies me
 &gt;somewhat, and it was certainly convincing enough so that...
 &gt;...IED, MarK T. Ganzer (one for the "where are they now?" file,
 &gt;sadly), and Joe Turner.
 &gt;     I believe IED no longer subscribes to my theory
 &gt;(although it fits the clues as given by Kate pretty closely).

     Actually, IED does still _hear_ the same thing you do, Jon. But he
still can't quite believe the solution could be that simple. And anyway,
as far as IED knows, we only came up with a solution for the first two
thirds of the passage. The last part is still a complete mystery to
IED. Remember: a sentence of twelve words, starting with "Don't".

       [ There!  You did it again!  -- |&gt;oug ]

     Ooh! Well, if IED can't get :&gt;oug to lose his cool by trashing
his interview, at least he knows that calling him :&gt;oug does the trick.

 &gt; FOR SALE:
 &gt;     KATE BUSH -  The Single File 1978-1983
 &gt;                  includes 12 singles plus booklet.
 &gt;will sell for $120.00 or best offer.  this is probably KATE's most
 &gt;collectable item that was OFFICIALLY released,  so if you want it,
 &gt;let me know.
 &gt;-- chuck radtke 312-833-8922 after 9:00 pm (HOME)
 &gt;             312-979-3373 anytime (work w/answering machine)

     DO NOT FALL FOR THIS CRAP! "chuck radtke" is a sleazy
con artist. IGNORE his ad. On second thought, call him up at the
above numbers and tell him what a slime he is. The "official"
_Single_File_ box set contains _13_ records and a booklet, not 12.
Ergo, you are being offered a used, pre-opened, no doubt ruthlessly
rifled-through product, pawed over by scummy black-market conmen
who are after as much unearned income as they can get. The going
rate for the _complete_, _mint_ box set at U.S. record-meets is still
well under $100.00. Thanks to Randall K. Smith for his early warning.

 &gt;Now, regarding IED's detailed critique of my interview with Kate...
 &gt;I'd like to thank IED for his constructive criticism, but I assure him
 &gt;it is entirely unnecessary.  Why bother, when I will be the first to
 &gt;admit it was a highly botched affair?  I had never interviewed someone
 &gt;before -- much less an idol.  I had all these questions written down
 &gt;on little index cards, and it was all I could do to read the cards and
 &gt;try to avoid wetting my pants or fainting.  All higher-level brain
 &gt;function was inoperative during the interview.  All I can say is that
 &gt;it was me that got to make myself a fool in front of Kate Bush for
 &gt;half an hour and not you...  NYAH, NYAH!

     OK. But IED _did_ get to make a fool of himself in front of
Kate for about three minutes once. And he _really_ made a fool of
himself in Kate's own house once, for _more_ than half an hour.
So :&gt;oug has no great cachet in that regard.

 &gt;I also find it amusing and ironic that IED continually lambasts my
 &gt;bizarre theories as the product of a derranged mind, while presenting
 &gt;his own ridiculous theories as objective fact.

     Notice, Love-Hounds, the absence of any supporting examples. :&gt;oug
wouldn't _dare_!

 &gt;Many of my deranged
 &gt;theories were not, in fact, developed by me alone.  Some of them
 &gt;(particularly the theories about "Get Out of my House") came about by
 &gt;consent through group discussion in this very mailing list by me and
 &gt;several other big KB fans that were around at the time this mailing
 &gt;list was formed.  (I think I will provide some more early Love-Hounds
 &gt;history sometime soon.)  I guess we are all bozos on this bus.
 &gt;
 &gt;-- |&gt;oug

     Maybe so, but not because you managed to find a bunch of L-Hs
to agree with you. "Consent by group discussion" has no value when
it is reached without a rational study of the facts, and in the face
of direct denials of their validity by Kate Bush herself.
     See again IED's points in his recent 500+-line review
of your interview, :&gt;oug, and you'll realize (perhaps) that the strength
of intellectual arguments is not founded on the number of people who
adhere to them, but by their intrinsic merit. Your theories about
_GOoMH_ have none of that, whether subscribed to by one or by a thousand
people, since (knowing what we know about Kate's knowledge of mules) they
have no rational or factual basis--a point which has already been proved
and documented so thoroughly as to dissolve all doubt.
     And even _without_ knowing Kate's understanding of the symbolism
of her imagery in _GOoMH_, the development of theories about the
song's meaning based upon a fetishistic preoccupation with the
genitals of barnyard animals is a highly dubious direction to take
in pursuit of a straightforward understanding of the song's probable
meaning. Not to have realized that was a serious lapse in judgement.

 &gt;I just noticed/read a little bit about IED saying that he hopes KB
 &gt;will release some of her earlier demos, thus ending the bootlegger's
 &gt;profit. On EMI of course. my response. COME ON!!!
 &gt;EMI would never release anything unless they knew they could
 &gt;get big bucks. They're paranoid about releasing a B-sides
 &gt;disc, so I doubt they would release any of the demo stuff...

                        -- and --

 &gt;This would be nice, but wouldn't Kate feel somewhat embarrassed about
 &gt;these old recordings and not want to release them because she feels
 &gt;they are not up to her current standards?  This is somewhat in line
 &gt;with her wanting to re-record her old album tracks for "The Whole
 &gt;Story", and her comments in one of the interviews IED posted that if
 &gt;she were to go on tour now she wouldn't play any of the music from her
 &gt;older albums.

     IED said he only _hoped_ Kate would put out all the demos herself.
He didn't say he _believed_ she would. On the other hand,
IED doesn't see any reason yet to doubt EMI's word (in their letter
to IED) that they still plan to put out some sort of compilation
of Kate Bush b-sides on CD. They have merely pointed out that the timing
is bad for them now. If IED were in charge of EMI he would not want
to put out such a CD now either. It would be unwise marketing to
put out a b-sides package less than six months (fingers crossed)
before the release of KBVI. If Kate doesn't tour in 1990/91, then
EMI will have no prospects of post-KBVI product from her until probably
1995 or 1996. They could scarcely put out another greatest hits package,
so 1991 or 1992 would seem to be the best time for the release of a
non-LP-tracks collection.
