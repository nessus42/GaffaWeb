Two new reviews recently came to my attention, the first in SPIN
magazine (which I refuse to re-post because I may bust a vein if
I read it again) which basically accuses Kate of being an outmoded
"sex kitten" type, which has no place in music.  Of course he doesn't
make any mention of all the other artists that use sex much more
blatantly (if you can accuse Kate of "using sex" at all) to sell
their "music".

The other review was quite good, from the latest issue of MUSICIAN
magazine:


		Kate Bush
		    *
	   The Sensual World

All it takes is a single listening to of _The Sensual World_ to understand
why it's been four years since Kate Bush released an album; a song cycle as
rich and deep as this takes a while to mature.  An overnight sensation who
became a star at the age of 19, Bush, now 31, has proven herself an artist
whose vision yields new and unexpected rewards with each record, and she 
executes several stunning turns on this, her sixth LP.  Her original use
of rhyme and meter, the wide frame of reference she draws from as a composer
and her inventive and fearless approach to singing fall into perfect sync on
nearly every song.

Often dismissed as self-consciously precious, Bush counters that criticism
here with 11 songs of such wisdom and poetry that only the most hardened
cynic would write them off as conceits.  Centering on the eternal struggle
between male and female, the album kicks off with a title track inspired by
James Joyce's _Ulysses_.  A celebration of the idea of giving oneself over
and embracing all that life offers--textures, tastes, experiences--"The
Sensual World" is an extraordinaryily erotic song, and Bush's breathless
vocal style perfectly complements the theme.  Next up is "Love and Anger,"
an anthem of faith in the notion that, despite the overwhelming fear that 
pervades the planet earth, human beings are capable of knowing and being
known by one another.  "The Fog" explores that theme further by celebrating
the leap of faith that love demands, while "Reaching Out" looks at how we're
instinctively drawn to both danger and comfort.  Every track on the album
offers something different to think about, and Bush's point of view on the
subject at hand is usually as smart as it is sweepingly emotional.

An atmospheric, ambitiously produced tapestry of sound, _The Sensual World_
has a massive, orchestral quality about it (one number [sic] features 
backup vocals by the Trio Bulgarka--in case you missed it, Bulgarian folk
is the hot ethnic music of the moment).  Despite the alaborate trimmings,
Bush's music remains profoundly human, earthy and moving.  Her songs seem too
reside in that waking dream state where deeply rooted fears and desires 
intermingle with the concrete reality known as the world; as painted by Bush,
that place is the essence of life itself. -- Kristine McKenna


obviously,  SPIN's reviewers must be "the most hardened cynics" 
:-)
