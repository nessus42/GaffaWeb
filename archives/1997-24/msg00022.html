&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone ever imagined Kate doing an all cover album ?  What are some of
&gt; the songs that you'd want to hear her immortalise ?  My list is below, feel
&gt; free to add to it !
&gt; I think she's more than just a singer-songwriter !  I think she's brilliant
&gt; at re-interpreting other's songs as well (i.e. "Rocket Man").
&gt; 
&gt; My List:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.      Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight  by The Beatles
&gt;         (Done ala "Candle in the Wind" would be lovely.  I'm a singer myself
&gt;         and recorded a version of these songs and tried to interpret it the way
&gt;         I envisioned Kate would.)
&gt; 
&gt; 2.      Love Will Lead You Back by Taylor Dane (written by Diane Warren)
&gt;         ( I know you're thinking, "WHAT...???".  But I would just love to hear
&gt;         Kate sing this sappy love ballad !)
&gt; 
&gt; 3.      Everything I Do ( I Do It For You) by Brian Adams
&gt;         (written by Adams, Michael Kamen, Mutt Lange)
&gt;         (Rumour has it that she was asked to do this but turned it down since she
&gt;         was busy working on TRS.)
&gt; 
&gt; 4.      Sexual Healing by Marvin Gaye
&gt;         ( I know this exists, so let's hear it !)
&gt; 
&gt; 5.      Moonraker by John Barry, Hal David
&gt;         (Another rumour is that she was asked to sing this.  She would've been
&gt;         brilliant.)
&gt; 
&gt; 6.      Tell Me Something Good by Rufus
&gt;         (She'd do a good Chaka...)
&gt; 
&gt; 7.      A Groovy Kind of Love
&gt;         ( Do it slow like Phil Collins.  I can almost see her pouting her lips and
&gt;         singing this one !)
&gt; 
&gt; 8.      Silent all these years by Tori Amos
&gt;         (Hey ! Tori did "Running Up That Hill", why can't Kate pay tribute to her
&gt; too !)
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I can't believe I started this thread and now I'm drawing a blank.  I
&gt; know the moment I send this, I'll remember the 50 others I wanted to hear
&gt; her sing.  Anyway...
&gt; 
&gt; Feel free to add to this !
&gt; 
&gt; hs 

Very different taste in music. Yeah I have thought about this. Here's
what I'd like to hear today.

-"The Sea Refuses No River" by Pete Townsend
-"Cascade"  by Souxsie and the Banshees
-"Atlas Marker" by Rickie Lee Jones
-"Shadows on a Dime" by Ferron
-"Desolation Row" by Bob Dylan
-"Caterpillar" by The Cure
-"Into the Fire" Sarah McLachlan
-"Swan Swan H" and "Wendel Gee" by REM
