&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;That's straight down the line? You have respect for him as a person?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;He was a great guitarist with some real imagination, but those days
&gt; are
&gt; &gt;long gone.
&gt;
&gt; The truth is that being a talented, highly recognized artist does not
&gt; mean
&gt; you are a likeable, all-around joe.  Many great painters, writers,
&gt; poets,
&gt; musicians, singers are notoriously crotchety, unpleasant, have bad
&gt; personal
&gt; habits, and some few of them are just not very nice people.
&gt;
&gt; "Respecting someone as a person" does not has one bloody iota of
&gt; anything
&gt; to do with how or why I might appreciate their work.
&gt;
&gt; I have immense appreciation for the brilliant works of Herodotus,
&gt; Sappho,
&gt; the scribes who wrote down the Song of Solomon and the Psalms, but
&gt; we'll
&gt; never know a thing about their personal lives, and it doesn't matter
&gt; at all.

I don't know that I'd go so far as to say that it doesn't matter at all.
Certainly, when it comes to a lot of the art I enjoy, I have to look the
other way regarding some of their personal behavior, lest it totally get
in the way of enjoying their art. *On the other hand*, I'll bet many
will agree with me that it's a real treat when you find an artist whose
creations you enjoy, *and* whom you find very likable as a person. In
fact, I think that's a lot of Kate's attractiveness, and part of what
makes her such a subject of fascination and even fanaticism for so many
people--I mean, what else would explain the shameless fawning I've seen
in so many posts on this newsgroup? :-) :-) Come on now, don't you
really wonder *how she does it*? How can she be "in the world, but not
of the world", as some religious people put it (usually without living
up to it very well, either).
