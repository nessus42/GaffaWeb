To whom it may concern,

Finally after a lot of time waiting, I have finished my list that I have
for trade or sale. 
If you find anything interested, please mail me your choice for further
information. 
The only real thing I still try to find are good photographs of Kate from
private collections and a mind copy of the Efteling Special. And afcourse
other fans who are just interested in exchanging thougths about everything
that has to do with Kate.


Regards,  Huibert
P.S. Those who have mailed me, have a little patience, I will mail you as
soon as I have worked out some other things.

Two Video's not full, but with a collection of many performances Kate did
throughout the world. Including the Efteling Special in Holland! The
quality of these recordings however is very poor!! Sometimes you hardly see
any picture at all. Or the picture has no colour or is in balck and white.
However it is very worthwhile watching this collection ones in your life.
The tapea are is not for sale, but one can borrow them at P&amp;P and some
other strict conditions.
