Greetings Love-hounds,

   About a month ago a bought the bootleg video called "The Collection" 
(Not to be confused with the Lovehound Collection which we all know was a
beautiful piece of collaborative work from some of our more distinguished
Lovehounds).   Anyway, Ther are a few items of interest in this video.  
BTW, it is listed in the collector's guide on page 108...but the video
track list is inaccurate.  Obviously, the author only read the track list
off the cover).     Most of what's on this video is already available in
the Lovehounds Collection or Kateopia.  

Ok, here goes:


1.  The Wedding List  (Prince's Trust Concert)
       - yes, this is the piece where Kate's dress straps snap towards
         the end of the performance.       (picture qaulity:  B)

5.  Suspended In Gaffa  (Champs Elysees, FRANCE, Oct. 1982)
       - Kate mimes to a backdrop of a Russian scenery.   She's wearing a
         grey dress with "puffy" shoulders".  There's a B&amp;W picture of this
         performance in the book "The Whole Story" by Kerry Juby.  BTW, the 
         photo describes her as performing "Egypt". 
       - Pic. quality: D-

6.  December Will Be Magic Again   (Abba special, Dec. 1979?)
       - Kate mimes to the Bongo version of the song while sitting in a

         mask.  The choreography is slightly different from what is in the
         official video. 
         Here, we can see a 10 shilling note animated on the screen along with
a
								
"tenner" and a "fiver"   ...for those of you wondering what she's 
         singing about...

       - Kate is interviewed in english.  Ther are dutch subtitles.
       - Pic. quality: C


Total running time:  1:23

For those of you wondering,  I found this video at a used record store called
Second Coming  in Cambridge, boston, Mass.  (near Harvard square).  They did
have another one available for $15.00....I think...)  (I do not work for them) 


I'm willing to make the "new" stuff available for a future video collection
project (like the Lovehounds Collection or Kate-opia).  Just email me and we
can set something up.  :-)

peace

ron
