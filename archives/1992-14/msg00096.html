Hi!

From:	william dickson &lt;wrd@halcyon.com&gt;

&gt;Well, I saw Sarah McLachlan last night at the Moore Theatre here in 
&gt;Seattle.  What a treat.

&gt;She performed every song from Solace, and a few others that I must assume 
&gt;were from Touch.  She was charming and funny and entertaining, and she 
&gt;sang like the world was going to end after the show and she wanted to 
&gt;give us something to hold onto when it did.

That's such a beautiful way to describe it!  I'm listening to the tape I just
got of her Boston show, and it's been sending chills up and down my back since
it started.  I'm kicking myself for not blowing off my mandatory commitments to
see her now. :P

&gt;My impression is it's a "Tori thing".  On her MTV live performances 
&gt;her right leg was always either stuck straight out toward the audience 
&gt;or back behind her.  Looked uncomfortable to me, but I guess it works 
&gt;for her. Maybe because she likes to be able to face the audience as she 
&gt;sings?

That's why, although if I were a crass sort of person I'd also think that it
has something to do with the edge of the piano bench...

It looks painful, but I don't think it is if you're limber.  Which I'm not, but
I'm assuming she is!

Also, she's left-footed, so she can hit the pedals with her left foot and face
the audience too.

&gt;   "Queer Positive?" Somehow, I find that to be an extreme contradiction in
&gt;terms. How can it be "positive" when you use such an outdated and degrading
&gt;term such as QUEER?  Maybe you can explain this to me.....

The term "queer", since it was a derogatory term for so long, has been
"reclaimed" by gay groups to be a positive terminology for their lifestyle of
late.  Just like the appropriation of the pink triangle for the symbol, which
was the Nazi symbol for prisoners in concentration camps whose "crime" was
homosexuality.  The point is to make it a non-degrading term.  I'm assuming
that's what was meant by "queer positive".  Though I don't see what that should
have to do with someone's music, unless they're outwardly gay-bashing.

Which network is Dennis Miller on, and at what time?
