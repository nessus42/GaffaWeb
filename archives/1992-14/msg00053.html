&gt;Did anyone see (or tape!!) the sugarcubes in chicago on tues night?
&gt;How was it? Can you do a mini-review? What did Bjork and Einar have
&gt;to say?  :)

I was there.  Not that I want to get into the popularity/coolness/mainstream
debate again, BUT there were a lot of kids at this show.  Some looked like
they could still be in grammar school.  But then again, what do you want
for an all ages WXRT show?


It was a lot of fun.  Einar was all over the stage acting quite goofy.  He
also made fun of the flood situation but his comment wasn't really that
funny.  There was a lot of stage diving too.  Kids.   Einar didn't like that
at all, especially after someone almost went head first into one of the 
wooden barriers in front of the stage.  He wanted to stop the show; he
might have thought the person was seriously hurt.  After the song was
over he seemed pretty pissed.  He said that if there was any more stage
diving he'd walk off stage!

Bjork had on tight black leather pants and a skin tight white something
or other which really showed off her , well, breasts.  THat woman has
a powerful voice for such a tiny body!  Her hair was done up kind of 
Princess Lea (Star Wars) style with there big triangle like cones one
each side of her head.  One of them kept coming undone and she would
walk off stage to fix it.

They did Birthday, almost every thing off the new albumn, as well as quite
a few of the older material.  I'd tell you but I'm not that familiar with them.
For some one them, Einar's voice was kindof disorted (on purpose) which 
added a real cool industrial effect to the songs.

They dedicated one song to Chicago (I can't remember which one) and one
to some discoteque in Iceland.

So... It was a fun show, a bit of weirdness (really?  :^)  , and they
did goof up, read mistakes, a few times,but that's okay.  I still don't
have total hearing back yet.

If anyone wants to hear about the opening band, Cracker, let me know.
