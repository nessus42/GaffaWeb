&gt;The Kick Inside was top-40 back then, fella.  Since then, her
&gt;popularity has been steadily on the wane, no matter how much we raving

Not true. Maybe it waned when The Dreaming came out, but it didn't half
wax again when she released HoL. However, I doubt she'll ever have
another #1, not that that's of any significance at all...

&gt;all.  To say that she's "very popular" is silly; if you consider being
&gt;the object of ridicule and derision in the press as well as popular

Everybody famous gets ridiculed and derided in our press sooner or
later. KaTe's come off better than most, probably due the gutter press
not being able to find many juicy secrets (and having more newsworthy
people to invent secrets about too 8^)

&gt;belief that she's totally 'round the bend as "very popular" ,then OK;

A bit of an exageration: there's a lot of stars who are widely perceived
as being a heck of a lot more "round-the-bend" than KaTe ever was. Take
Wacko Jacko f'rinstance. (He's still being portrayed on "Spitting Image"
with oxygen mask in hand!)

&gt;she's very popular.  However, there are many MANY artists who chart
&gt;more consistently and more frequently that Kate.

I would say practically everybody who takes any interest at all in
rock/pop and who's been around in the UK for the last 7-14 years has
heard of KaTe, knows what she looks like, and can hum at least one of
her songs. Ok, they may only remember Wuthering Heights or Wow, and the
leotards and waving arms, but they still remember her. Charting singles
are becoming increasing irrelevant now that the UK singles chart is
full of the kind of "dance" crud that takes 5 minutes to throw together
on a Wavestation or whatever. (oh for the early eighties again 8^)
