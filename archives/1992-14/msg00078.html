Since I've been on a self-imposed CD exile since March, I've been watching
with keen interest at this whole Tori Amos thing. I've been unable to find the
infamous "Winter" CD-5, and I don't get MTV so I haven't heard her. Until I
read here that she was going to be on Letterman, so I stayed up, even though I
had a major final the next day, and watched the damn thing.

I liked it. I don't think that her voice is particularly KaTe-like (whose is?),
and I probably wouldn't have thought of KaTe when I heard her except for all
of the discussion here, but I thought it was damn good. Still haven't heard the
album yet, but I thought The World's Most Dangerous Band did a superlative job
of backing her (I'm getting more and more respect for them all the time). When
I finally got off of my CD exile on Friday, I hightailed it over to Sound
Warehouse to buy "Little Earthquakes," but the bastards wanted $15.99 for it,
so I had to skip it and go for the comparatively cheap T. Rex "Electric
Warrior" ("only" $13.99. God, we're all getting screwed by the music industry),
so I still haven't heard the album. But when I go home for the summer and go
to Kemp Mill, I know I won't have to spend more than $12.99 on it.

As I've only begun to watch regularly in the past few weeks, does Letterman
usually do the kind of gushing about his musical guests that he did the other
night? Granted, he didn't TALK to her or anything, but he sounded like he had
actually heard and liked the album. And I'm glad to know that I'm not the only
one who thought her right leg just looked plain wierd bent like that. I thought
it may have been a "Tori thing."

   ---snappy new end-of-file sign-off quote from Adventures in Babysitting,
         which was the source of last week's quote, but this is this week's
         new quote, and I'm leaving for home on Wednesday so I thought it was
         appropriate and I love Albert Collins anyway

 V       that paper that's due 5:00 tomorrow

Say, have I told everybody that I saw U2 two Mondays ago?
