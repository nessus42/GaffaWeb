&gt;Subject: Review of Tori Amos' _Little Earthquakes_
&gt;Date:	Wed, 22 Apr 1992 20:44:07 -0700
&gt;
&gt;This appeared today in my school's newspaper, _The California Aggie_.  I
&gt;though people might be interested in seeing it, so...
&gt;
&gt;TORI AMOS CREATES BIG, EMOTIONAL EARTHQUAKES
&gt; 
&gt;You may have seen her in _Rolling Stone_.  Or heard her on MTV. 
&gt;Or on KWOD [a local "modern rock" station].
&gt; 
&gt;But you have truly *heard* Tori Amos until you have listened to
&gt;her album, _Little Earthquakes_, over and over again.  The debut
&gt;from this North Carolina discontent will find a cozy, intimate
&gt;nook somewhere in the middle of your heart, and neither
&gt;understanding nor explaining that is going to be easy.
&gt; 
&gt;Perhaps it's the way her piano sounds like raindrops in the
&gt;background--light, ethereal and unpretentious behind the thin
&gt;veil of her voice.  Or perhaps it's got something to do with the
&gt;airy, high-altitude quality of her lyrics, the way her poetry
&gt;brushes over critical ideas without so much as a misplaced mild
&gt;preaching.  Or even the melodies of her songs--they are slight,
&gt;inspired, articulate.
&gt; 
&gt;But most of all, Tori Amos' work will make you *feel*.  After
&gt;hearing the distanced intimacies of her rich soul, you will want
&gt;to call her by her first name.  It seems impossible that somebody
&gt;whose words breathe through your mind with such familiarity and
&gt;agility is not a member of your family.  A sister, maybe.  Or a
&gt;guardian angel.

The one thing about Tori's songs I haven't seen mentioned yet is the stream-of-
consciousness lyrics.  It's great to have stream-of-consciousness songs!

Now, if we could get Tori to cover "The Sensual World" . . ..
 
&gt;And of course, "Silent All These Years" cannot go without
&gt;mention.  This is possibly the most accomplished work on the
&gt;album, because it blends Amos' impressionistic vocals with the
&gt;floating lyricism of her piano playing.  Amos' sound has nuances
&gt;of the preternatural quietness of Kate Bush, as well as the
&gt;shapely distillation of her bright harmonies.
&gt; 
&gt;"Silent All These Years" opens with one of the most irresistible
&gt;questions in memory--"Excuse me, but can I be you for a while?" 
&gt;Amos continues to draw on this thought, pleading for the person
&gt;who causes her pain to see her situation from her point of view. 
&gt;"It's your turn now to stand where I stand," she reminds him in
&gt;the last stanza.
&gt; 
&gt;- Rosemary A. Peters

This is the song that has the line:

	"I love the way we communicate;
	 your eyes focus on my funny lip shape."

Someone posted a literary reference to the "funny lip shape" phrase last
week.  Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention at the time.  Could
whomever it was please repost the reference?  Thanks.

Regards,
Andy
