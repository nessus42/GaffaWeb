&gt;Keep in mind that Europe is tiny; France being the size of Texas and
&gt;all.  To say that she's "very popular" is silly; if you consider being
&gt;the object of ridicule and derision in the press as well as popular
&gt;belief that she's totally 'round the bend as "very popular" ,then OK;
&gt;she's very popular.  However, there are many MANY artists who chart
&gt;more consistently and more frequently that Kate.
Well according to my world atlas Europe is bigger than the US and has
about three times the population. I was refering to numbers of KaTe fans
per square mile...:)
&gt;
&gt;I get the feeling that she's viewed there somewhat like, say, Devo is
&gt;here - been around a while, had some hits, kinda arty, a new album
&gt;shows up every once in a while and people go "oh yeah them", but
&gt;mostly they're considered totally whacko.

I think (know)  KaTe is perceived as the female Peter Gabriel in Europe.

&gt;
&gt;I'm AMAZED if WFNX or WBCN or even WZBC or WMBR play her at ALL.
&gt;Occasionally WFNX will play _Running Up That Hill_. 
Bzzzt-wrong! I have heard all sorts of KaTe, from 'Babooshka' to 
'The Dreaming', and from 'RutH (live)' to 'The sensual world' on WFNX.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;You want obscure cult figures, try Happy Rhodes.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;No thanks, I had some last week and it gave me gas.  :)
See, she *is* an obscure cult figure, some people can't handle her. :)

&gt;************************************************************************
&gt;* Anyway, the point I was simply making was that people were reading a *
&gt;* LOT into the "secret message", and that I was hoping we WOULDN'T get *
&gt;* into the same flame war we've had so many times before.  Flame wars  *
&gt;* are only cool if it's new ground...                                  *
&gt;************************************************************************
I agree with that.  Flame wars are so cliche' in .gaffa. I wonder what the 
next one will be about. :)
