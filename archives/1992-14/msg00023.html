&gt; faux /joe [tw]rites:
&gt; 
&gt; flame wars are only cool if it's new ground...
&gt;

10 years of net history (and 6000 years of human history) should have taught
you that there hasn't been a new flame war in at least that long.

As a matter of fact, there is a little-known Greek text by the scholar
Mapius Vicus (translated recently) discussing Womens' Epic Poetry and
the three most highly-respected practitioners of the art at the time:

	Siberius, Rodius, and KaTius

There was a rival from Japan (Suzisu - accent on 2nd syllable), but she was
deemed to follow too closely with the Populists to rank truly with the
other three.

Most people believed that KaTius (spelling origin unknown) was quite mad,
since she wrote lines in many of her poems from right to left (the two
most well-known examples being the inverted text at the end of "Levit O Pen"
and her masterwork, written in Chinese ("Wa Chingyu Witzau Mi")).

It is also believed that Siberius was the mother of modern drama, being one
of the first poets to express multiple viewpoints in the same body of text.
She fell into obscurity in the latter half of the eighteenth century BC,
and re-surfaced years later as a cartographer.

Rodius was relatively obscure, so little is known about her, but Vicus writes
with great fervor about the beauty of her voice and her spiritual sisterhood
to KaTius (generally believed to be the greatest or the least of the three,
depending on the mood and point of view of the person in question).

Curiously, Sappho was not mentioned - apparently because she worshipped the
Goddess Olivia and refused to write poems for anyone else...
