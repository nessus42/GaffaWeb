Now, I'm not advocating you call this number and request a package
or anything, nor am I advocating you show this to your friends and
have them call up and get these people to send them their package
NOR am I advocating you tell your friends to tell their friends to
call these people up and get them to send their package.

Ecetera.

My gosh, if I did THAT and knowing that none of yours or my friends
would do anything WITH the package besides using the return envelopes
as a repository for used condoms, dead roaches and bathtub drain
scrapings, these poor God-fearing folks would, like, go out of 
business and we wouldn't want THAT since their "message" is so
very important, isn't it?

psalm 103:1-5

Dear Friend,

	For the pst six months, Freedom Village, USA has concentrated
much time and effort on a national campaign to STOP "MURDER MUSIC",
alias "music pornography".  The hour has finally arrived in which
we involve you, our supporters.  We have put together this campaign
packet, entitled "HOW TO STOP MURDER MUSIC IN YOUR TOWN."  It is
important that you understand our position against "MURDER MUSIC"
as well as follow all provided instructions.  We need you to fill 
out every letter and petition with the proper information.  Then 
mail all the completed informaion back to Freedom Village, USA.
The petitions will be sent to the Federal Communications Com-
mission (FCC) and we will mail each letter to your respective state
Attorney General, Governor, and Senators.  If you do not know your
state officials, call us at (607) 243-8126, and we will provide
you the information.  Please feel free to make copies of any letter
or petition to give to a friend or relative.  Just make sure, how-
ever, that there is only one name and address per petition and letter.
There is one exception. The groups petition to the Federal Communications
Commision must be filled with several names and addresses
before being sent to us.

	We cannot express how crucial you are to our compaign (sic).  You,
the people, are the ONLY chance we have to rid America and Canada
of "MURDER MUSIC."  It is up to you to demand a change!  "MURDER
MUSIC" has run rampant up to now and millions of lives have been
destroyed in the process.  As a home for troubled young people,
we get no thrills treating the end result of "MURDER MUSIC"...
usually a drugged-out, sexually active and rebellious teenager.
We believe treatment for the troubled young person is most effective
when cured at the infectious root.  That root "MURDER MUSIC."  The
cure... STOPPING "MURDER MUSIC"!

	We await your support.  Thank you.

						Because of Jesus,

						Fletcher A. Brothers
						Paster
