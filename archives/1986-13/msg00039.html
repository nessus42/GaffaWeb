Summary:  Gee.  There is no punchline.


Let me explain.  A while back I posted a letter I had received from "The
Freedom Village".  Since this mailing list had previously been the 
repository documentation of other rightwing and Xtian Fundamentalist attempts to
censor or shape rock music into their own Image, I thought it would interest
some of you that there is this kind of organization that is out soliciting
people and telling them these lies.  This group, Freedom Village, takes
in (and sometimes just takes) kids who have mental problems due to either
drug use or bad family life (ironically, a high portion of child abusers
are Xtian Fundamentalist...) or whatever and is blaming the problems of
these children on the loose morals (allegedely) promoted by Rock music.
I thought you might want to be aware of this group and I was laying subtle
hints that perhaps you should write or call them and obtain their literature
and see for yourself (and also perhaps deplete some of their funds - an
old anti-authoritarian trick - witness:  jerry falwell's 800 number).  

There was no punchline.  This stuff is serious.  Whenever a state is
considering anti-Rock music legislation (i.e. censorship by any other
name) as was done in Maryland recently, Freedom Village sends down
truckloads of chanting xombie like children to distrupt and "witness"
for the legislators.  Zappa has said alot of these children are scripted
beforehand as to what to say.  Also, these people send children into
local punk rock shows and distrupt shows and bring the Police in.  (Guess
who gets clubbed first folks...).  Finally, they are mounting a campaign
to get the FCC to regulate the airwaves and only grant liscenses to
stations who adhere to a strict "moral" guidline in the lyrics of the
songs it plays.  The "moral" guidelines, of course, may not coincide
with your own views (yes, IED, Kate's lyrics would be the first to
go, buddy).

Well, that's all... you can thrash it out from here.  I really thought
some of you had a little more sense than to think I was actually
seriously promoting this group.  If not anything else, I take an adament
stand against censorship.

					Thanks for your time,

						jim....

p.s. Dave Hsu, I can't get back in touch with you.  Can you write back
     and send your numbered domain address.  This might work.  I am
     trying to get your machine added to our host table.  Later.
