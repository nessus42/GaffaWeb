&gt; Who or what the hell is "Princess Tinymeat" ??  I have seen two of his/her
&gt; records in the last week, and they both have kind of, um, disturbing covers.
&gt; Anyone familiar with this, uh, recording artist?

Princess Tineymeat is a partial re-incarnation of the late, great, Virgin
Prunes. So i was told at Newbury Comix in Boston when i bought the 12"
single "Sloblands" there about a year ago. I cannot, however, identify
any of the artists as being identical to members of the Virgin Prunes, and
also, VP just came out with another album after 3 years of nothing.
The music (PT) is loud, obnoxious, innovative, and different. I like it,
but it's not something you'd want to play at a dinner party. It consists of
somewhat intelligible vocals, a heavy and simple drum beat, thoroughly
distorted guitar, and various mixed-in background noises. The only real
similarity i could find to VP was that it was recorded at the same studio.
As to the new VP record - i thought it was a big disappointment. Their
music used to be primitive, and yet sophisticated, cynical lyrics that
mixed incredibly well with very simplistic melodies which were executed
so well that you'd never be able to tell... Eccentric music, and true
to the title of one of their larger projects, "A New Form of Beauty".
Especially in their last album, before the long pause during which nothing
was heard from them, entitled "If I die I die", the Virgin Prunes achieved
a very polished, musical sound, of such eccentric originality that i doubt
anything comparable will ever come out of that genre again.

                                      - Ziggy Cyber

p.s.: if anybody knows more about the background of either of these
      two bands, i'd be _extremely_ interested.
