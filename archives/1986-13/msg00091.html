     I realize that the Eurythmics represent a more popular sound than the
average Love Hound is use to, but I thought I'd recommend their latest album,
Revenge, none the less.  I have not liked any of their previous material at
all, but Revenge has some very pretty stuff on it, both lyrically and
musically.  (You have to get past "Missionary Man", though.)
     Is anyone out their into "modern folk"?  Even if you're not, broaden your
musical horizons, and get a copy of Christine Lavin's Future Fossils.  It is
very pretty, also, and contains a lot of variety.  I particulary like a very
traditional cut on the album entitled "Rituals".  Seeing as our Katie just
recently turned 28, and is anything but traditional, I'd love to hear her sing
such a song, which is sort of from the same genre as "The Man With A Child In
His Eyes":


                                    Rituals

                               (Christine Lavin)


I'm not so very old, (she said,) I just turned 28
But, boy, it's been a long, long time since I've been on a date
I mean like a dinner, and a movie, a goodnight kiss at the door
We are not content with kisses anymore

My Grandma told me stories, how she and Grandpa met
How their courtship followed local rules of etiquette
The flowers that he brought her, the dresses that she wore
But we are not impressed with such rituals anymore

My father met my mother through a mutual friend
They knew each other for two months before they ever kissed
And when they did, they were embarrased and just a little scared
By this awkward declaration that they cared

But now we rush into everything so fast
Love that's here so quickly soon becomes a part of the past
It never works out right
'Cause nothing everlasting ever happens overnight

So if you think you love her, take your time
Walk her in the moonlight, maybe even try to write
A line or two of poetry, or perhaps a song
You might find you're building a love that's going to last a long, long time

Take your time, oh, take your time
There is something to be said for rituals we've left behind
There's something to be said for the dance
Back to old-fashioned romance


Though this may have nothing to do with Kate, or this forum, I think that
"Rituals" is a nice contrast to Kate's music, and that the more music one is
exposed to, the more he/she will appreciate Kate's.
     One more thing:  Believe me, my contact is trying his hardest to acquire
some copies of The Dreaming on CD.  A Love Hound recently asked if anyone has
actually ever held one in their hand.  My contact assures me that he has, and
that he can eventually get his hands on more of them.  The problem is that The
Dreaming just plain isn't very successful in England, as we all know, and as
a result, is a rare thing on CD.  Now that Capitol has opened a new plant in
America, that could change, given the album is *relatively* successful here.
English plants have apparently halted all production of this CD, though my
contact feels he can find some of the ones already produced lying around in
his importers' stock.  Import laws could be another obstacle.  Just letting
everyone know that I'm still trying, and am on the phone every other day about
this matter.
