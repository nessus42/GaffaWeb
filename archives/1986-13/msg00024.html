Here is the text of the form that is now included with the
"Frankenchrist" album in place of the H.R.  Giger poster:

  "WELCOME TO 1984..."

  As you may have noticed, a crucial part of this album is missing.  On
April 15, 1986, combined forces of the Los Angeles and San Francisco
Police Departments raided the headquarters of Alternative Tentacles, the
offices of Mordam Records (our distributor), and Jello Biafra's rented
flat.
  Their purpose was to seize copies of Dead Kennedys' "Frankenchrist"
LP, copies of H.R.  Giger's "Penis Landscape" poster, and "invoices
and/or other documents tending to show the processing distribution of
the poster and record album as described in the affidavit..."
  Their excuse for the raid was "distribution of harmful matter to minors".
  Coincidentally or not, a governor's task force in California recently
released a report claiming, "Heavy Metal, Punk Rockers and Satanic
groups have emerged as a new gang phenomena."
  "These groups' activities include drawing graffiti, using illegal
drugs, abusing children and assaulting parents.  Grave robbing and
desecration of animal and human remains are some of the more bizarre
activities...they listen to heavy metal rock music...enjoy shock
value...and believe in Anarchy..."
  Meanwhile, the Union City, California Police Department has issued a
20-page training manual called "Punk Rock and Heavy Metal:  The
Problem/One Solution".  According to "Rock and Roll Confidential"
magazine, "It specifically warns about the danger of rock and roll being
used to make political statements...A list of bands to avoid
includes...Husker Du, Rush and Van Halen...If PR&amp;HM doesn't do the job
for parents, officers are told to have them call the youth services
board for help."
  RRC also claims, "This manual (was) actually written by the Back in
Control Training Center (2555 E.  Chapman, Suite 213, Fullerton, CA
92631) (and) is currently being used by at least two other California
police departments."

  If you still want your "Frankenchrist" poster, please fill out the
form below and send it to us along with $.50 postage and handling.

 If you find this foom humiliating, well, you could be right.  Just wait
until you have to sign one of these every time you want to buy a record.
