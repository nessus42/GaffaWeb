     I'm afraid I still don't see the "MURDER MUSIC" punch line, but never
mind.  Many of you were asking about The Dreaming on CD.  Someone told me today
that it is available as an import from Capital, who, unfortunately, has a
reputation for manufacturing poor-quality CD's.  He told me he would check to
make sure of his access, but believes he can obtain them for fifteen dollars
each.  He also mentioned that Capital has a new U.S. plant, and manufacturing
is expected to improve.

     So that I don't leave anyone out, here's someone's KT-shirt idea which I
forgot to include in that list:

 &gt;Subject: piKTure    &lt;--look ma, I can make KTgram too!
 &gt;Date: 22 Aug 86 11:36:18 PDT (Fri)
 &gt;From: tsung@aerospace.ARPA
 &gt;
 &gt;So has anybody figured out the legal aspects (if any) of using the
 &gt;record cover pictures on the T-shirt?  I hope it shouldn't matter
 &gt;since we're not trying to make money (are we? :-).  Or, perhaps we can
 &gt;contact Kate Goddess Bush (wait, that's KGB!) herself and get her
 &gt;permission.
 &gt;
 &gt;W.r.t T-shirt designs, I like IED's first idea.  Comments:
 &gt;1) on the back, I think the quote ("with a kiss ...") should be the
 &gt;center of attention, and written in solid black ink.  The KT logo
 &gt;would be sort of semi-existent (e.g. dotted in) so that to the
 &gt;uninitiated, the logo appears only as a sort of an abstract design
 &gt;quitely permeating the back.  It would not compete with the quote
 &gt;for attention lest the design on the whole gets too crowded.
 &gt;(what's da term they use ... "negative space").
 &gt;
 &gt;2) On the front, "Love-Hounds" letters are as big as the letters in the
 &gt;quote on the back.  "An Inter .... Forum" are smaller, perhaps all fit
 &gt;on one line, or even moved below the picture.  The picture would, of course,
 &gt;take up most of the space.  Something like:
 &gt;
 &gt;        L  OO V V EE          NN DD SS
 &gt;        LL OO  V  EE   etc      NN DD SS  . . .

 &gt;
 &gt;comments and attacks welcome.

Sorry, Fu-Sheng, for leaving that out, especially after you sent it twice.
Again, I still think we need to address those questions concerning legalities,
production, and REduction, before we try to decide.  Shall we just assume that
using an album-cover picture could definitely get us in touble?  I don't think
Kate would actually sue US, but EMI probably would.
