Jon Drukman states:
 
&gt;I'm surprized at the posts here that say "I listened to some Happy stuff
&gt;and I just don't see what the big deal is."
 
 I listened to some Happy stuff and I just don't see what the big deal is.
 
&gt; I know people who find KaTe too "screechy" as in Violin Song.  They
&gt;catch on eventually though.  Give Happy a chance, she's golden, just
&gt;as KaTe is.
 
 Happy and KaTe in the same sentence?  No I don't think so.  I
received the "Warpaint" CD as a gift, played it, then played it 2 more
times 'cuz I just knew I had to be missing something, I found one song
(the last one) that I 'kinda liked then gave the CD away.  I'm sure
Happy is a very nice person but she sure 'aint no' KaTe Bush.  Happy
an American KaTe?  Thats ludicrous at best.
 
 
 
 Michael Graham asks:
 
&gt;Were ALL of the photos from Cathy scanned - must be a short book if so.
&gt;What are the captions like?
 
 Michael if your looking at the scans that have 3 or more images per
gif those are the ones I scanned and yes thats the eniter book, each
image was a page, each B&amp;W photo a little over 7x5, something like 27
of them.  The book is in an interesting format, each photo page is
proceeded by a page that has had the center cutout thus acting as a
frame for the following photo, the captions were written on these
proceeding pages below the "frame".  In the captions John Bush
(photographer/brother of course) talks about ecah photo a little,
nothing spectacular but nice just the same.  The book is lovely,
nothing short of a treasure.
