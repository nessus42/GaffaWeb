Jon Drukman had his Happy Rhodes fan club membership revoked when he wrote:
&gt; Vickie said:
&gt;&gt;As far as "synth-padding" goes, here it comes again:
&gt;&gt;You haven't heard the songs. There is no padding or filler on her albums.
&gt; 
&gt; I think Richard meant padding in the musical sense, where you play a chord
&gt; and it fills out the background of the music.  That's called a "pad."  On
&gt; the other hand, maybe he was just being mean.  (You wouldn't do that, would
&gt; you Richard?  You're the kinder and gentler love-hound!)

Kinder and gentler to some, hostile without the saving grace of your
wit and sarcasm to others.  All of these things, maybe, but mean?  I hope
not.  It's certainly not my intention to be mean but I can't deny that
I do suffer from fits of pique from time to time.

In any case, the padding remark was a referring to what I find all too
often in single person efforts with small budgets, not a criticism of
Happy Rhodes (since I haven't heard it).  At worst, you might say it's
what I was afraid Happy might be.  Oddly enough some people reacted 
as though I proposed to give them a root canal with an ice pick and 
a Daffy Duck PEZ dispenser.  I wonder if I touched a nerve?

&gt; Richard heard Caterwaul on a tape I made for him of about 20 different
&gt; female vocal tracks.  I just listed the artists and titles, he asked about
&gt; the stuff that interested him.  Quite different from logging in every day
&gt; and seeing five new messages telling him to mail order all their stuff.

Jon even put some '70s disco music on there as a joke.  Um, that was a
joke wasn't it Jon?
