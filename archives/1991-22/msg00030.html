&gt;there are 3 KT CDs in the HMV 3 discs for #20 sale.  

Also, the Virgin Megastore on the corner of Oxford Street and Tottenham
Court Road (and therefore probably any Virgin store) now has Never For
Ever, The Dreaming and Hounds Of Love at mid-price (about #7.99). The
Kick Inside and Lionheart have been widely available at mid-price for
some time now but this is the first time I have seen these three at this
price. The Sensual World is still about #12.00 and I don't remember what
The Whole Story was asking.

As you may have surmised I was in London this weekend although I bought
absolutely nothing KaTe-related - for myself anyway, Scott Telford has
been pestering everyone about getting his hands on a Love &amp; Anger
CD-single and I picked one up for hime at Sister Ray records on Berwick
Street. I've found that they usually have at least a couple of things of
interest to the colleKTor. For example, they have most of the British
singles (not Wuthering Heights) and this time they had a couple of
Japanese singles (Wuthering Heights and Them Heavy People (that may have
been the B-side)) and the Big-Sky picture disk. They are expensive
however. Not so long ago they had TSF box set and were asking #90.00
which broke my heart because I couldn't aford it at the time. Now they
tell me they charge #100.00 for it when they have it. They had doubled
the usual price of the Big Sky pic-disk to #20.00 and were asking over
#30.00 for the two Japanese singles. Of course they also carry the TWW
box set but surprisingly at a reasonable price (about #90.00 for the CD
version). If you have the chance and the cash you should pop along and
take a look.

I tried to pick up another picture t-shirt from the General Store on
Carnaby Street as advertised on Love-hounds over a year ago. The one I
have is slightly too small and I wanted to get an XL. They don't stock
it any more though.

KaTe is still featured on the Tube Stations in a poster featuring the Beetles
Display for the Rock Circus at the Trocadero.

Cheers, Evan...
