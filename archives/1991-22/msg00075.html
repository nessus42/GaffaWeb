 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: KT NEWS, etc.

   Well, IED may not be the first to report it here, but Ed did request
an immediate notifiKation, so here goes: IED went into Dave's Laser Video
in Sherman Oaks, CA yesterday afternoon and found a BIG PILE of Kate's
_The_Whole_Story_ laser-disks--the new U.S. edition--stacked up in a
corner.  It's officially out, folks! And at $24.95 (less 10% at this
particular store). You can't complain about that price.
   To a casual glance without the benefit of a-b comparisons of any
kind, the new edition seems essentially the same as the earlier Japanese
inKarnaTion, except that there's no Japanese (!).
    Anyone reading this digest who doesn't have Kate's _TWS_ videos and
who does have access to a laser-disk player--do not hesitate to buy this!

    Andrew Russ asked what the best source for determining the location
and decoding the content of the various "secret messages" in Kate's
music is. IED would recommend the lyrics file marked with an "ied" in
the filename. It should be found in the Love-Hounds archive somewhere.
In that file IED attempted to transcribe every word found in Kate's
songs, though this was of course only partially a success.  Nevertheless,
you should find many little surprises if you read along with the songs
using IED's transcriptions.  Also, IED would appreciate it if, in the
event that you _do_ make such a study of the words, you could record your
own improvements, additions or comments and post them here. IED for one
is always fascinated by speKulaTion about the lyrics.

   IED believes Peter of _Homeground_ is aware that a substantial number
of American fans would like to get advance tickets to Kate's concerts.
Perhaps Peter can be persuaded to let someone at the Bush camp know of our
dilemma. There is only a slight chance of a result that way, of course, but...
   Meanwhile--no joke-does anyone know whether it is possible to register
Love-Hounds as a legitimate "publication"? What would we have to do to
qualify for press passes at concerts as "Contributing Editors" of
Love-Hounds?
                              Naively curious, he remains

Andrew Marvick (IED), out in the garden with half of a heaven (and no,
he does NOT mean an eight-track tape deck!)
