&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;Time, as promised, for my Red Shoes review.
&gt;
&gt;#2, 'A gentleman's excuse me' by Fish. But MoP is slowly but surely
&gt;surpassing TWW. I  *L   O   V   E* this song. Anyone criticizing
&gt;this song will have to deal with me! (You're warned...) Rating: 20.

Saw this one when she played it on Mikey Aspel's chat show and wasn't at all
sure about it - now I *like* it - it's slowly growing on me...

&gt;The red shoes: Hey, this is a good song! She really *finished* this
&gt;one! Titletracks of Kate are always very good - this one is no
&gt;exception (mind you, 'The dreaming' was... but that's another
&gt;story) (Rating: 9)

Agreed - I do love it when she 'jigs' :-)

&gt;Why should I love you: Kate showing that she can use literally
&gt;everyone and blending 'em nicely into her own music. I do like
&gt;Prince occasionally ('When doves cry' is probably one of the best
&gt;songs from that year), and here he shows that he can still play
&gt;guitar and keyboards like the best of them, though he has decided
&gt;to make yukky music on his own albums. Like I wrote above, this is
&gt;the happy song the album needed. It works for me - I don't
&gt;understand why it doesn't work for others. Prince-loathers, maybe?
&gt;Look beyond the person, please. (Rating: 8)

I really only replied so that I could make some comments about this last
paragraph... let's get a few things straight :-) Prince is one of the most
gifted Musicians currently working today - he has evolved constantly, 
expoloring different aspects of music over the past 15 years - he has been a
major influence on a lot of people - his latest work is not at all 'yukky',
whatever that was intended to mean. The man is a genius.

So, when pairing two gifted people together I was hoping for something more.
I am *dissapointed* with the song - must be Lenny Henry's input :-) The
lyrics sound like something Prince casted off a couple of albums ago - take a
look at 'Diamonds &amp; Pearls' - which was dredged up for use here. I believe that
they never actually met?? I would have to say that this is one of Prince's 
worst outings with female partners... I just don't think that Kate has got 
what Prince needs - also, do you think they slept together? Prince is known
for his *interaction* with his female counterparts...

The songs doesn't work for me.

Thanks for listening,
Mark.
