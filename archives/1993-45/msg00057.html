&gt;Jane Siberry at the GEM Theater in Detroit 11-6-93

I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to meet you there.

&gt;If you get the chance go see her.  She is only playing
&gt;5 or 9 dates total (She said 5 the promoter said 9).

Both are correct in their own way. 5 cities in America (LA,
SFO, Det, Bos &amp; NYC) and 9 dates total (1 show in LA, 2 shows
in SFO, 1 show in Detroit, 1 show in Boston and 2 shows in
New York. Plus 2 shows in London.) Though I could be wrong and
it's possibly 2 shows in LA &amp; 2 shows in Boston, which would
still make 9 in the USA.

&gt;The theater: itself is a small renovated theater with
&gt;       	table seating on the main floor and a small
&gt;	balcony.  It looked like there were around 50
&gt;	tables total with 4 seats a table. So around 
&gt;	200 folks in all.  very intimate.  It looked
&gt;	like there were two or three tables in the 
&gt;	balcony that were empty but the place was
&gt;	wise full and sold out.

Interesting. We had heard before the show that it was not sold out,
so perhaps many people ended up buying tickets right before the show.

&gt;	She now acquires THE red guitar and moves to the 
&gt;	chair center stage.  She plays and sings a new 
&gt;	song, or at least one I've never heard.

She gave me the names of all the songs, but I haven't transcribed
the interview yet. It will be posted in Ecto.

&gt;	Placing the Gtr carefully on the floor she fiddles
&gt;	with a video tape and introduces _The Bird in the 
&gt;	Gravel_.  She turns it off before the credits have 
&gt;	finnished elicting some moans of disapproval.  She
&gt;	promises to let us see some credits at a point later
&gt;	in the evening.

:-) That was, um, me. I yelled out "aw, we *like* credits!"

&gt;IF you get the chance SEE this EVENT.  And if anyone tapes it please,
&gt;please, please get in touch with me.  I would love a copy.

Us too!!

Vickie
