Announcing the NETTWERK BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM!!!!
=================================================

Just call (604) 731-7007 using ANSI terminal emulation. The BBS is in
Vancouver, British Columbia.

It's about time. The Nettwerk BBS is up and running. Decades of intensive
work and studies have culminated with this message. And I can't think of
anything to say. A true first.

I guess the first question you might have is "Why? Why would an independent
record label in Canada of all places, bother to have a BBS? What are you
thinking and what are you hoping to accomplish?" Good question, I'm glad
you asked. Let me ramble on briefly.

First an introduction to Nettwerk. Nettwerk is an independent record label
and
management company that came into being in the early 80's so that the people
involved could put out music that they liked. In the ten years that Nettwerk
has been around not much has changed in that respect. Our artists have
covered
the musical spectrum from the industrial noise of Skinny Puppy to the
haunting
range of Sarah McLachlan's voice with some left wing ranting from
Consolidated
and the pop stylings of The Grapes of Wrath, (who are, if you have been
keeping
track, now called Ginger) with a bit of everything else in between.

Our first step into cyberspace was an Internet account:
nettwerk@mindlink.bc.ca
E-mail has been pouring into the office daily. From all over the world. At
all
hours. Don't you people ever sleep? Then we realized that we could set up our
own little cyberland, the Nettwerk network. And we have. This is it. Who
would
have thought?

There are two sides to this board. Our purpose behind the first half is to
exchange information with people who are interested in doing so.
Pretty simple really. On our BBS we will have as much information as we can
gather about Nettwerk and the artists that have been associated with Nettwerk
over the last decade. Bios, discographies, tour schedules, newspaper and
magazine articles, upcoming releases - whatever we can find. The best thing
about this is that you can shape what is on the BBS. If you know some
information that we have overlooked or don't know then you can send it to the
sysops (system operators) and we'll add it, crediting you of course. Our FAQ
files (frequently asked questions) are just skeletons of what they will
become
after some of you get hold of them. This board is as much yours as it is
ours.

There are also discussion groups on various artists and styles of music.
If you are a Sarah fan, drop into the Sarah group in the Discussion areas and
see what people are talking about. Leave a message for others to read. Review
a live show that you went to or an album that you bought. You can talk to
people from all over about what you like and don't like about Nettwerk. Any
time. We only close when 7-11 does. Which is never for the few of
you who are lucky enough not to have one in your neighbourhood.

You can check out the online chat feature and have a real time discussion
with
whomever happens to be online. Yell at the sysop and if we are around,
we'll yell back. We'll have monthly contests for various things that are
either
new or rare or just taking up space in the stockroom. You can ask questions
of
each other or direct them to someone at Nettwerk. Go crazy.

The second half of the board is set up for ordering Nettwerk releases and
merchandise. Mail order without the mail. Faster, cheaper, and easier. Very
soon there will be a 1 800 number for you to call to place
your orders via modem. It's pretty simple. Through this you'll be able to get
some things before they are available in your area, order Canada only
releases,
and track down those titles that you've been looking for that your local
store
doesn't carry. We are an independent label, we realize that everything we put
out doesn't get everywhere. Now it does. This includes the latest T-shirts,
posters, videos, and postcards.

So that's the basic idea behind the Nettwerk BBS. We're here to be of service
to you. Any ideas that you have are welcome. That's how this whole thing got
started. That's how Nettwerk got started. Like I said, this is as much your
place as ours. We are going to be constantly expanding and upgrading, with
internet access and ftp capabilities coming in 1994.

PS - There are some very interesting things I have found digging in the
Nettwerk archives. Expect to find some surprises on the BBS over the
     next few months! We just started this BBS so please give us a chance!
