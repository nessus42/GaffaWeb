&gt;Subject: TRS+7 days
&gt;
&gt;Hello, Earth,
&gt;
&gt;Well, I've had The Red Shoes for a week now, and after a dozen or so listens
&gt;and a week of reading reviews, rants &amp; raves on Lovehounds, here are some
&gt;desperately needed comments:
&gt;
&gt;o  This is the FIRST Kate album since Never For Ever that you can instantly
&gt;   say "Well, this one sure is better than the last one!"  OK, so The
&gt;   Dreaming is better than N4E, but (and I'm addressing fellow old-timers
&gt;   here), it took you awhile to figure that out, didn't it?
&gt;
&gt;o  Even though The Red Shoes is better than The Sensual World, TSW is still
&gt;   a better album to make love to.
&gt;
&gt;o  Some folks are whining that Kate's no good anymore 'cause it's not as
&gt;   good as The Dreaming or Hounds of Love.  I'ld like to see YOU make a
&gt;   couple of albums as good as good TD and HOL hen try to make something
&gt;   even better!  For that matter, I'ld like to see you try to make a couple
&gt;   of albums as good as TD or HoL!
&gt;
&gt;o  Saying "Kate sucks" 'cause TSW and TRS aren't as good as TD and HOL is
&gt;   like saying The Beatles suck 'cause Magical Mystery Tour and Let it Be
&gt;   aren't as good as Sgt. Pepper or The White Album.
&gt;
&gt;o  With Kate's legacy, she could put out a dozen albums of note-for-note
&gt;   covers of Menudo songs and STILL be the greatest musical genius of
&gt;   all time.
&gt;
&gt;o  As for you who say "Sure, I love 'Hounds of Love', that doesn't mean
&gt;   I have to love 'The Red Shoes'."  True, but if you want to hear HoL,
&gt;   then play it!  The will never be another HoL;  TRS (and for that matter,
&gt;   TSW) are great albums in their own right!  If you want HoL Part II,
&gt;   you will be sadly dissapointed.  If you want a disc full of great music,
&gt;   TRS is a must-have.
&gt;
&gt;Now, comments on heavily-discussed songs (and some changes of my previous
&gt;review):
&gt;
&gt;o  I previously graded the title cut a "B" 'cause I didn't know where
&gt;   it was going, and when I knew I thought it took too long to get there.
&gt;   Now that I know the path, I think it's a great song.  Another 'A' for
&gt;   Kate!
&gt;
&gt;o  "Why Should I Love You?" - I have to admit, this song really bites.
&gt;   For the first time on any Kate album, I routinely hit skip (if listening
&gt;   at home) or fast forward (if listening at work).  Old grade: C-
&gt;   New Grade:  D-  Easily Kate's worst non-remix song.  And it's not Prince's
&gt;   fault, either (if he was THAT much of an influence, it would have been
&gt;   called "Why Should I Love U?")  I thought the clever wordplay at the
&gt;   end could save it, but noooo....
&gt;
&gt;o  Lily-  This is just me, but I have to disagree with the majority here;
&gt;   this song just doesn't do it for me.  Yeah, musically it's great
&gt;   but lyrically, it's a turn-off.  The only spiritual songs I like are
&gt;   "Dear God" by XTC and "Christianity is Stupid" by Negativland.
&gt;
&gt;o  Constellation of The Heart has been getting a lot of bashing here;  I
&gt;   think it's a fun song, and I love the Dialog part.  It kinda reminds
&gt;   me of Waking the Witch, actually.  (Waking the Witch Lite?)
&gt;
&gt;o  Song of Solomon has been also getting bad press here, a large part for
&gt;   THAT line.  All you sensitive Katefolk out there can't take being blunt.
&gt;   Me?  I don't think it's vulgar ENOUGH!  I think Kate should just YELL
&gt;   OUT the point of the whole song, and scream "Fuck me NOW!"
&gt;
&gt;o  I'm starting to not dislike Eat the Music.

&gt;
&gt;larry:
&gt;&gt;&gt;Second point: "Song of Solomon" is totally *EXCELLENT*.  
&gt;
&gt;woj:
&gt;&gt;perhaps the most impressive thing about this song is the sampled harp
&gt;&gt;sound. i was convinced that they had hired andreas wollenweider (or 
&gt;&gt;some such harpist) to play on that track the first time i heard it.
&gt;&gt;perhaps this ties in with your comments about the engineering too: the
&gt;&gt;crystalline sample is gorgeous.
&gt;
&gt;guess i'm jaded, having a totally way bitchin' ultra rad keyboard
&gt;(wavestation) in my studio that can run rings around this harp sound.
&gt;i instantly pegged it as keyboard.  the voicings give it away, for one
&gt;thing - none of those little arpeggios that harpists are well known
&gt;for.
&gt;
&gt;does anyone think that "song of solomon" is nothing but a rehash of
&gt;"between a man and a woman" and "never be mine"?  (two of my least
&gt;fave TSW tracks)...  i definitely hear it - the beginning where she
&gt;sings the title a few times is the exact same melody as BaMaaW...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Big Stripey Lie (C)
&gt;&gt;&gt;	NK's violin lends a feel reminiscent of Anna Palm "Arriving and
&gt;&gt;&gt;	Caught Up".  Commendably strange, but that's not enough -- it
&gt;&gt;&gt;	doesn't gel.  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;there's lots of little bits here and there that show an attention to detail,
&gt;&gt;but as you say, it doesn't gel. i still think it sounds like a splattered
&gt;&gt;canvas rather than a completed work, despite all the tiny bits that are
&gt;&gt;buried in the mix (like the wave sounds near the end).
&gt;
&gt;you two heretics should be shot and burned.  splattered canvas my
&gt;butt!  i'll splatter a canvas with your entrails and then i'll smear
&gt;your blood on my face and do a nifty little interpretive war dance in
&gt;which i explain through the language of movement how totally way rad
&gt;bitchin' big stripy lie really is.
&gt;
&gt;(actually i am getting kinda sick of it now but it's no splattered canvas.)
&gt;
&gt;another engineering comment:  much as i love "lily", the drum sounds
&gt;are godawful!!  sound like they were broadcast into a cheap AM radio
&gt;which was then recorded via a radio shack condenser mic.  with a
&gt;fairlight and an akai s1000 you'd think she could've got some BOTTOM
&gt;END in there.
&gt;
&gt;one last global comment (for now): john giblin's bass playing is
&gt;excellent, as always.  give the guy some props!

&gt;No, you're not! I feel that dissecting and analyzing the songs is

&gt;not the technical quality of recordings or things like that.
&gt;
&gt;Remember: only dead creatures can be dissected. Music must be alive to

&gt;
&gt;    &gt; However, I do find the discussions about what Kate is referring

&gt;
&gt;I agree with that as well.

&gt;Subject: Constellation of the Heart
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps I've missed it, but I haven't seen anyone comment on the presence of
&gt;the phrase "the big sky" in this song, and the fact that it's rythmically
&gt;identical to the same words as sung in the song "The Big Sky" on the "Hounds
&gt;of Love" album.  
&gt;
&gt;For those who haven't heard it yet, the lines I'm refering to are:
&gt;
&gt; "We take all the telescopes 
&gt;  and turn(ed?) them inside out, 
&gt;  and we point them away from the big sky."  
&gt;
&gt;(from memory - apologies for tiny mistakes)
&gt;
&gt;I wonder if Kate is being self-reflexive and saying that she has turned
&gt;her own view away from the ideas expressed in the song "The Big Sky" and is
&gt;instead looking more inward, to her heart.
&gt;
&gt;Also, isn't there a telescope in the video for "The Big Sky"?
&gt;
&gt;Anyone agree with the conjecture?  Disagree?  Couldn't care less? :)

&gt;	I finally have it (a deplorable lack of capital prevented me from
&gt;acquiring it sooner) and have listened to it twice.  I think it's a fine
&gt;album (with a few minor flaws) that I am looking for to hearing many more
&gt;times.  It's not "Hounds Of Love" or "The Dreaming", but I don't need
&gt;another HoL or TD.  That was then, this is now.  I am only concerned with
&gt;where Kate is currently and what she deems worth releasing under her name.
&gt;That's all.  She grows, she changes, as do I, and I've always felt a kinship
&gt;with her (maybe because we are almost the same age) that continues with this
&gt;album.  The only time she will ever disappoint me is if she should ever do
&gt;something that wasn't true to her own artistic vision.  I trust her never
&gt;to do that (why should she start now?)  I've been a fan since the 1st album,
&gt;they all have strengths and weaknesses, but they are all Kate and I love
&gt;them dearly.

&gt;Date: Wed, 10 Nov 1993 21:36:41 GMT
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Alot has been said of TRS as a whole and of each of the songs.
&gt;I feel compelled to share some of my observations about the 
&gt;album, and hopefully clear up some of the flak about "Kate sucks"
&gt;or "this song sucks" and hopefully give the album and songs 
&gt;a balanced place in the Kate universe.
&gt;
&gt;Firstly, like every Kate album, a single listen is not enough!  A dozen
&gt;listens is not enough!  You have to FEEL the album, and that takes time!
&gt;I had mixed feelings for the album at first, especially certain songs
&gt;and where Kate was directing her music, but the underlying themes and
&gt;musical groundwork is pulling together for me.  Certainly she has grown,
&gt;and in doing so, made appreciating her album more work!
&gt;
&gt;General Observations about the production:
&gt;
&gt;More of an attempt to musically connect vocals and the instruments is done,
&gt;especially vocal solos with guitar solos and use of the Trio as a vocal
&gt;instrument rather than backup vocals.  A more "rock" flavor is introduced
&gt;into the music, which makes it seem to me like Kate is trying to "blend"
&gt;the earlier sound of the KB band with the newer works with modern and 
&gt;classical folk instruments.  The results are a leaner sound again for Kate,
&gt;with the studio wizardy shifted from affecting the later "denser" layered
&gt;music to a subtler blending of instrument and vocal effects.  Again, I feel
&gt;this reflects the growth of the artist focusing on refinement of style,
&gt;rather than the up front, more apparent sound of an artist pushing a style
&gt;breakthough (The Dreaming is the breakthough album, w/o question).
&gt;
&gt;Vocally, Kate has again matured.  Though her voice is rougher (smoking does that),
&gt;and she no longer sings in that unholy key ( E, an octave above middle C, I think)
&gt;her voice remains capable of an incredible range of style and emotion that 
&gt;few have matched.  She has also matured in the same sense vocally as musically,
&gt;that is the vocal dramatics are better blended into the song and not as
&gt;apparent and in your face.
&gt;
&gt;All in all, I am glad for the album.  Artists that recycle the same sound over
&gt;and over grow stale, and Kate is definitely NOT that.  Sometimes that may
&gt;define art (growth, I mean), and lyrically, the songs have gotten more personal
&gt;and intimate.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Rubberband Girl-
&gt;	Bouncy like the title.  Pretty much a pop song with some Kate touches.
&gt;	Her muzzein like ululating vocals tie directly into the guitar solo. 
&gt;	To me she is trying to link how they touch the same feelings in 
&gt;	different cultures.  I find some definite Prince "Minneapolis rock"
&gt;	touches in this song too (the keyboards when she does the "vocal stretch")
&gt;	so I laugh when people like this song but poo-poo WSILO.
&gt;
&gt;And So Is Love-
&gt;	Kate Sings the Blues?  Really, the song is Kate singing, and Eric Clapton
&gt;	answering her on guitar.  She included her keyboard "flute like" sound
&gt;	to add more of an mellower tone to the song, and the percussion moves
&gt;	interestingly from channel to channel.  She sings with some real emotion
&gt;	in this song but with more of a traditional blues style!
&gt;
&gt;Eat The Music-
&gt;	This controversial number is hard to define.  It has to be taken as a whole,
&gt;	and no focus placed on any piece.  First of all, it is not traditional Kate
&gt;	(whatever the hell that means).  I think attention should be paid to the
&gt;	recording mix of the instruments and the background vocals, and the attention
&gt;	paid to the dynamics of the two.  I like the lyrics, and the atmosphere
&gt;	projected by the song, but will say it can seem weak next to Kate songs
&gt;	that are so more emotionally charged.  But I dislike people saying it sucks
&gt;	because it doesn't carry the emotional punch of other songs.  Get a life,
&gt;	fellas, not every song by Kate has to be a cathartic experience.
&gt;
&gt;Moments of Pleasure -
&gt;	And listening to this is one!  I like when Kate hands the orchestration
&gt;	to someone else (like This Womens Work) and focuses of vocally showing
&gt;	what she's got under the bonnet (hood, for Americans)!  Her phrasing is
&gt;	so exquisite and the soaring vocals make the lyrics even more powerful.
&gt;	'Nuff said about this, Kate shows none can match her vocally, though that
&gt;	is only a slice of This Womans Talent.
&gt;
&gt;Song of Solomon-
&gt;	In a similar vein to Between a Man and a Woman.  Enough bullshit about
&gt;	the bullshit in the lyrics, she writes what she wants.  I like the 
&gt;	smooth, clean percussion, light keyboards, backup vocals that are like
&gt;	strings, that gradually progress to the Trio joining while Kates voice
&gt;	sounds more urgent, then the whole thing winds down smoothly again.  A
&gt;	well crafted song, that like many of Kates breaks the traditional rules
&gt;	of how a song should start stop and end.
&gt;
&gt;Lily-
&gt;	What is going on at the beginning while Lily chants?  It works for me,
&gt;	alien and going right to the core of me with those vague noises.  Some-
&gt;	times, Kate can do things to sounds that scare me.  Hard, hitting, 
&gt;	magical, primitively pagan, this song is a Kate strong point, something
&gt;	no artist ever does.  Her vocals during the chorus are unbelievable,
&gt;	with the her voice breaking into each note with a hard urgent squealing
&gt;	quality (how did they engineer that?), and miscellaneous Kate shrieks popping
&gt;	in at a low level on the far right channel.
&gt;
&gt;The Red Shoes-
&gt;	This combined with Lily, constitute what I believe is the core of the album.
&gt;	Almost a jig, this song has keyboards throwing whipping, vibrating sounds all
&gt;	over the percussion, with Kate's vocals and the whistle layered over this.
&gt;	Kate's recording wizardy is to produce a 3-D space that is remarkably vast
&gt;	(listen to the birds fly away in The Dreaming) and this song really uses
&gt;	that vast space to it's best ability.
&gt;
&gt;Top of the City-
&gt;	This song is good, though somewhat troubling for me.  I found the chorus
&gt;	repetitive, and the shift from the refrains to the chorus too abrupt.
&gt;	But the backup vocals with the bass line, and the percussion is exquiste,
&gt;	and the Kates vocals are HOT.  The siren noises in the background show
&gt;	her attention to detail, and I understand what she wanted to do.  She
&gt;	reversed a song taking the usually exciting and hook-laden chorus and
&gt;	dimishing it, while pumping it up while she sang the refrains.  Interesting
&gt;	thought to experiment with, and perhaps with some more refinement it could
&gt;	become more interestingly powerful.
&gt;
&gt;Constellation of the Heart-
&gt;	Clever lyrics!  "We take all the telescopes/And we turn them inside out/
&gt;	And we point the away from the big sky".  A personal statement about
&gt;	her work, perhaps?  This song, structually is the most straighforward
&gt;	pop, but Kate peps it up with some emphatic vocalizations at then end.
&gt;	The chorus is the more interesting part, with backup singers echoing
&gt;	Kate, but the singers doing the refrain sound muddled.  The funk guitar
&gt;	is an interesting touch.  Again, I find Kate playing with song structure,
&gt;	by not taking the front seat on lyrics she is doing some new work and like
&gt;	Top of the City, a more refined version of this style will be out and 
&gt;	more impressive the the listening audience.
&gt;
&gt;Big Stripey Lie-
&gt;	What a song!  First thing, the BALLS Kate has.  Here she has two of the 
&gt;	world's more well known legends of the guitar, playing on her album, 
&gt;	Eric Clapton, and Jeff Beck, and without any reservations debuts her 
&gt;	first guitar solo right along both of them on her album!  It's a searing,
&gt;	minimal Kate style, with a dirty guitar and bass, some heavy bass and 
&gt;	strings, and murky, tight lyrics.  It has alot of power to me, and I 
&gt;	almost don't like to listen to it.  But no question, it's a powerful song, 
&gt;	(I think the most powerful) on the album, and quite a breakthrough for her 
&gt;	in terms of style.  I can't describe what makes the song so brilliant
&gt;	(perhaps just the open rawness), but it certainly is.  It is disturbing in
&gt;	the way Get Out of My House is, without the dramatics.
&gt;
&gt;Why Should I Love You-
&gt;	This song, again a flak magnet, does work on different levels then the 
&gt;	obvious ones.  Prince is a musical genius in his own right (and
&gt;	misunderstood as well), and Kate just doesn't do the Minneapolis sound,
&gt;	she adds the Trio in a church choir style.  Like the difficult Rocketman,
&gt;	where she made reggae with Kate styles an unusual blend, she does likewise
&gt;	here.  Purists argue that this isn't Kate, but in reality only Kate has the
&gt;	right to say what is and isn't her!  Technically, all of the elements of
&gt;	the song, the Trio, the Prince keyboards and guitar, Kate and the backup
&gt;	musicians blend flawlessly, while Kates vocals are technically challenged
&gt;	by the tricky chorus (just try and sing it, I DARE you!).  I wonder about
&gt;	those viewing her choice to be a versatile artist by incorporating 
&gt;	contemporary conventional pop music as being negative.
&gt;
&gt;You're The One-
&gt;	Again, Kate applies her profound knowledge of music to a conventional
&gt;	song.  Of interest to me was again the emphasis of the vocals against
&gt;	the guitar, most apparent here with the Trio and Jeff Beck (who can 
&gt;	ever effectively blend two elements like this? Only KATE) as they
&gt;	swirl in and out together, while Kate sings of the particular pain
&gt;	of breaking up with someon you love.  Interestingly I notice the vocals
&gt;	and guitars most here and in Rubberband Girl, the first and last songs
&gt;	on the album.  Details like that are what Kate is.
&gt;
&gt;So, in closing, don't take the album at face value.  Kate has expanded beyond
&gt;crafting songs, but now as a _musician_ is growing steadily.  I consider The
&gt;Kick Inside and Lionheart as one chapter, and Never For Ever, The Dreaming, and
&gt;Hounds of Love as another chapter.  The Sensual World opens a new one, with a 
&gt;new focus and direction, and The Red Shoes a forward step from there.  I look
&gt;forward already impatiently to see what Kate has learned from the process of
&gt;these last two albums and where she will take them.  We are listening to one
&gt;of the most important musical artists ever, and one hundred years from now maybe
&gt;everyone will appreciate the real scope of what This Woman's Work means.

&gt;Subject: Random Thoughts
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Just a few random Red Shoe notes:
&gt;
&gt;I've loved "And So Is Love" since I picked up the 3 .au files off the Internet
&gt;ftp site (I forget which one). I'm glad the fidelity of the CD is better than
&gt;the sample in the .au file, but the first Clapton break still sounds fuzzy.
&gt;BUT he plays a GREAT hook just before the first occurance of "You let it slip"!
&gt;This hook ranks right up there with a Lindsey Buckingham lick that makes
&gt;"You Make Lovin' Fun" worth wading through. Funny how the pay-off to a whole
&gt;song can occupy a mere 5-6 seconds.
&gt;
&gt;As far as "The Song Of Solomon", I love the spacey, distant, echoey intro,
&gt;the background stuff that continues throughout the song. And that's enough
&gt;to make me like the song, even if I didn't love the rest of it anyway.
&gt;
&gt;I love hearing the re-appearance of Gary Brooker. Procol Harum is "of" my time
&gt;(i.e. I'm an old fart). Yes, I know they re-united, but I passed on that
&gt;episode (only so much concert/CD money to go around). His playing on "And So Is 
&gt;Love" is tasteful and a good complement to Clapton's bluesy guitar. On "You're 
&gt;The One" it's prototypical Brooker. And on "Constellation" it's something 
&gt;completely different, which is welcome.
&gt;
&gt;And perhaps my view is tainted by 24 years as a Deadhead, but "You're The One"
&gt;IS a Grateful Dead song, or easily could be. The structure, the changes,
&gt;the Hammond. Sounds like any number of their mournful ballads. Maybe that's
&gt;why some of you hate it so much ;-) Perhaps they'll cover it in concert 
&gt;(they've covered stranger things!)
&gt;
&gt;A few Sensual Notes:
&gt;
&gt;I think it's a great album! Sure, the initial bells aren't the clearest.
&gt;Could've gotten better bells from a sound effects album. But they're probably
&gt;the real bells from KaTe's childhood church and probably sound that way in 
&gt;person.
&gt;
&gt;"Reaching Out" is a throw-away, except for the a-capella section at the end.
&gt;Still, it's a lot to wade thru just for that. "Deeper Understanding" should
&gt;be the official theme song of all of us Net-heads, anyway. And personally,
&gt;"Never Be Mine" is my favorite from the album. Just touches something deep in
&gt;me. "This Woman's Work" and "Walk Straight..." close the album strongly.
&gt;
&gt;I don't understand the complaints, either about the content or the recording
&gt;quality. And all your whining about it won't change it from being one of my
&gt;all-time favorites, IMVHO, of course.
&gt;
&gt;Finally, an observation on Jon:
&gt;
&gt;Now I see the appropriateness of Druckman's "extreme violence" signiture! 
&gt;"Splattering YOUR entrails", really! I'm usually pretty stressed out, too, 
&gt;Jon. But since I've been studying Shaolin, my Kung Fu workout drains my 
&gt;hostility away pretty fast. Maybe you ought to find something like that and 
&gt;give it a try ;-)
&gt;
&gt;Love,
&gt;

&gt;From: briarpatch!billy@uunet.UU.NET (Billy Green)
&gt;Subject: Yet another "Red Shoes" posting....
&gt;
&gt;First, old business:  I still have a couple of "Rubberband Girl" posters
&gt;(40" X 60") left--never picked up by those who inquired and no responses 
&gt;from them regarding my e-mail--available for $7.50 each (what they cost 
&gt;me wholesale).  I should have the 40 X 60 Red Shoes poster in by the end 
&gt;of this week or early next week, plus I am promised that my 40 X 60 Vox 
&gt;magazine cover posters are being shipped out "tomorrow" (11/11), so I 
&gt;should have those by late next week (I hope!).  Prices and availability
&gt;when they arrive (I ordered 18 Red Shoes and 10 Vox, but what I receive
&gt;might be different, plus the price on Red Shoes was listed today as 
&gt;being higher than it was six weeks ago, so I'm not sure how much they'll
&gt;be until they get here).  As before, they will be available to anyone
&gt;who can come to my house to get them.
&gt;
&gt;Preliminary thoughts after spending a week with The Red Shoes:
&gt;
&gt;Kate's trend toward optimism continues and increases.  Never For Ever
&gt;almost seems to have been a thematic low point, where the recurring theme 
&gt;was death (even down to the album's title), and songs ended on happy notes
&gt;like "After she shot the guy/She committed suicide".  
&gt;
&gt;Hounds Of Love (rather, The Ninth Wave) was a noticeable turning point, 
&gt;where the heroine decides she wants to live even after the nightmares she's
&gt;been through, kisses the ground and gives thanks that she's alive.  
&gt;
&gt;Songs about distracting oneself from conflict or bad relationships ("The 
&gt;Big Sky" and "Not This Time") gave way on "The Sensual World" to songs of 
&gt;pushing through the bad spots and looking to others for help ("Love And 
&gt;Anger", "Reaching Out").
&gt;
&gt;So why, then, do I not cringe when The Red Shoes keeps giving out lines
&gt;like, "Just being alive/It can really hurt", "life is sad", "I feel that
&gt;life has blown a great big hole through me"?  Even when the line, "Just
&gt;being alive, it can really hurt" appears identically in two different
&gt;songs?  Because this line isn't the end of the story.  This time, someone 
&gt;is always there to pull the sufferer through the pain, so the pain is 
&gt;always fleeting and even leads to better things.  So the basic message seems 
&gt;to be "Life *can* really suck, but it sucks worse when you're all alone."  
&gt;The message isn't left in terms of such a simple maxim, however.  There 
&gt;is an undertone of "There are times to reach out to others for help and 
&gt;protection, but there are times when you need to protect yourself as well.
&gt;Recognize the difference and hope that you'll know how to act appropriately" 
&gt;(e.g., "Lily" and "Big Stripey Lie" and "Constellation Of the Heart").
&gt;
&gt;Most of these twelve songs deal directly with interpersonal relationships, 
&gt;both romantic and platonic (but decidedly more romantic than not).  
&gt;"Rubberband Girl" makes no reference to anyone other than to the self 
&gt;(though I suppose one could argue that, since it's about someone wishing 
&gt;to be more flexible, that it's about one's relationship with oneself):  And
&gt;the title song is about love of the dance.  This is a true dancers' song, 
&gt;the closest I've seen someone come to expaining the passion involved in 
&gt;devoting oneself to one's work.  The narrator uses the curse of the shoes to
&gt;find some happiness--though cursed to dance till her legs fall off, she 
&gt;lifts her eyes to God and uses the unstoppable dancing to make her dreams 
&gt;come true.
&gt;
&gt;Speaking of lifting your eyes to God, I notice a large number of spiritual/
&gt;religious references on this album as well (and I don't mean "Oh *GOD* it's 
&gt;a jungle in here."):  
&gt;"Song Of Solomon"; 
&gt;the narration at the beginning of "Lily" ("Oh, thou that givest sustenance 
&gt;       to the universe", etc.); 
&gt;the angels Gabriel, Raphael, Michael and Uriel;
&gt;"eyes are lifted to God"; 
&gt;"Where just a couple of pigeons are living/Up on the angel's shoulders/
&gt;       I don't know if I'm closer to Heaven but/It looks like Hell down
&gt;       there"; 
&gt;"'Tis here where Heaven and Hell dance"; 
&gt;"she's opening up the doors to Heaven"; 
&gt;"Your name is being called by sacred things/That are not addressed nor 
&gt;       listened to/Sometimes they blow trumpets" (angels perhaps?)
&gt;"The red of the Sacred Heart"; 
&gt;"Have you ever seen a picture/Of Jesus smiling?"  
&gt;(That's what I find on a cursory glance at the lyric sheet.)
&gt;
&gt;So the next question would be "Why?".  For the most part, these are not
&gt;exclusively Christian images.  Kate has never been one to shove religion in 
&gt;others' faces (to the contrary, she's very guarded regarding her personal 
&gt;life), and I think that these references are intended to be taken more as 
&gt;literary references (for want of a better phrase) than as Bible-thumping.
&gt;(Also,I don't think "this cross is your heart" is a religious reference; 
&gt;my first thought on hearing this line was of a graphic image "X" or "+" and
&gt;not of a crucifix).  
&gt;
&gt;Tentatively I will make this guess about why she's using all the religious 
&gt;imagery:  She's underscoring her references to relationships so that you 
&gt;know she's speaking of deep, spiritual love (and even spiritual sex), and 
&gt;not just about casual or superficial relationships.
&gt;
&gt;I kind of consider "Constellation Of the Heart" as the culmination of 
&gt;this album's images.
&gt;
&gt;Let me preface these remarks with a few words about the song, "The Big
&gt;Sky".  I've always viewed that song as being about an argument.  The
&gt;story underneath the song seems to be this:  Two people on a hill are looking
&gt;at the shapes in the clouds; one keeps interjecting the statement, "You
&gt;never understood me/You never really tried"; the song ends with the phrase,
&gt;"You want my reply?/What was the question, dear?/I was looking at the
&gt;big sky", as if to say, "You never tried to understand me, then, fine, I've
&gt;more interesting and amusing things to pay attention to than *you*, and
&gt;they don't require understanding."  This is similar to the theme of "Not
&gt;This Time," where the singer sings nonsense lyrics to keep herself going
&gt;in a decidedly abusive relationship--both give images of someone distracting
&gt;herself to keep from facing an unpleasant situation.
&gt;
&gt;Well, now she's saying "Stop looking at the damn sky and look at yourself
&gt;instead.  Follow your heart, steer straight into the storm.  The storm is 
&gt;unpleasant, but it ends--and that's your path to paradise."
&gt;
&gt;It is in "Constellation Of the Heart" that the religious images are linked
&gt;back to the human element ("'Tis here [in the heart] where Hell and Heaven 
&gt;dance") .  This is the song that repeats, verbatim, the line from "Moments 
&gt;Of Pleasure", "Just being alive, it can really hurt," and answers it with 
&gt;"Without the pain there'd be no learning/Without the hurting we'd never 
&gt;change."  This is also the song that echoes the "Top Of the City" image of 
&gt;a ladder to salvation/escape ("She's no good for you, baby/Look I'm here 
&gt;with the ladder" echoed by "Find me the man with the ladder/And he might 
&gt;lift me up to the stars").  The curve (smile), cross (heart) and line 
&gt;(path) mentioned in "The Red Shoes" and echoed in songs like "Song Of 
&gt;Solomon", "Eat the Music" and "Why Should I Love You", seem to have become 
&gt;linked in this song to deliver this message:  "Examine what's in your heart,
&gt;trust what you find there.  It will lead you to the path that will lead 
&gt;you toward happiness."
&gt;
&gt;If this is the overall intention of the album, then it is far and away the
&gt;happiest message Kate has yet delivered.  And the alternate track listing
&gt;makes sense that way, too--take the song about the confusion of breaking
&gt;up ("I want to stay with you.  But I can't stay here.  But I want to 
&gt;stay.  But...") and follow it with the song about the fear and anger of 
&gt;betrayal, and end with the song that pulls all the others together.
&gt;
&gt;Also, it helps point out to me something I hadn't quite caught on "The 
&gt;Sensual World"--if there is a recurring theme on that album, it is the 
&gt;theme of helping, reaching out, working together, teaching.  I always 
&gt;complained that the songs on "The Sensual World" didn't hold together like 
&gt;Kate's other albums, that it just seemed a pointless mishmash of songs.  
&gt;I'll have to go back and look at it again now......
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;(Amusing P.S.:  A few weeks ago, I was passing a shop that sells wind-up 
&gt;and battery-operated toys, a lot of which are animals.  They had a large 
&gt;sign in their door which read, "It's a jungle in here!"  I had to control 
&gt;the impulse to scrawl "We've got wild animals loose in here" at the 
&gt;bottom...)
