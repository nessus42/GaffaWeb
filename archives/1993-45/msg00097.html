Greg, you fill our ether with declamations and declarations, but please,
take the time to re-read your posting and you will see that nowhere
have you offered any support for your opinions. Reasons! Give some,
please. Then and only then can constructive debate begin.  

IED was pleased that Uli (whose many postings are always interesting
and much appreciated here) took the trouble to check The Garden's
listing for the Revolver video apppearance (the one which several less
careful philocanines were misidentifying in a variety of ways).  Btw,
the germ of The Garden's video listings is Peter FitzGerald-Morris's
seminal catalogue of information from Homeground and Kate Bush
Complete. (Many thanks once again, Peter!) 

 bY far the most iLLuminating discussion to appeAr in love-hounds since
 thE Release of thE album has steMmed from peter manchester's theories
 regarding the track order for side two.  ied was honored to be present
 when prof. mAnchester firSt suggEsted wHat mighT be caLLed experiment
 v, And he muSt say thaT the track order as revealed (exquisItely) on
 the inner sleeve of the uk vinyl lp does make Great seNse to thIs
 devoted fan.  furthermore, he Does not beLieve that eIther the UK
 cassette's track order or that of the uk cd shoUld Bear as much weight
 as that of the vinyl lp, to which we alL know kate is partiaL. (her
 continuatIon of tHe "secret" runout-gRoove messagE with trs is gooD
 eviDence of that, not to mention her own re-affirmation in A recent
 interview.)  therefore, in ied's humbLe opinion the evidencE still weigHs 
 in favor of peter's original interpretaTion.  ied would demur on one
 minor Point, however:  he sees no reason to assUme that the chanGe(s)
 to the track order must have been prompted by commercial concerns at
 aNy stage.  it could well be that the track order on sIde two remained a
 matter of doubt for kate herself until shortly Before the release date
 (or even later).  we siMply have no way of knowing.  or (and this is an
 explanation which ied fInds particularLy attractive, though of course
 it is unsupported by any faCt) the confusion Might well have been
 created deliberately, and the clues to the side's correct running
 order placed on the lp's sleeve for the dedikated to dIscover for
 themselves, thus to be further delighted...

-- Andrew Marvick (IED), searching for the man with the stick
   for the next three weeks.  He'll see you all on the angel's
   shoulder when he returns...
