larry:
&gt;&gt;Second point: "Song of Solomon" is totally *EXCELLENT*.  

woj:
&gt;perhaps the most impressive thing about this song is the sampled harp
&gt;sound. i was convinced that they had hired andreas wollenweider (or 
&gt;some such harpist) to play on that track the first time i heard it.
&gt;perhaps this ties in with your comments about the engineering too: the
&gt;crystalline sample is gorgeous.

guess i'm jaded, having a totally way bitchin' ultra rad keyboard
(wavestation) in my studio that can run rings around this harp sound.
i instantly pegged it as keyboard.  the voicings give it away, for one
thing - none of those little arpeggios that harpists are well known
for.

does anyone think that "song of solomon" is nothing but a rehash of
"between a man and a woman" and "never be mine"?  (two of my least
fave TSW tracks)...  i definitely hear it - the beginning where she
sings the title a few times is the exact same melody as BaMaaW...

&gt;&gt;Big Stripey Lie (C)
&gt;&gt;	NK's violin lends a feel reminiscent of Anna Palm "Arriving and
&gt;&gt;	Caught Up".  Commendably strange, but that's not enough -- it
&gt;&gt;	doesn't gel.  

&gt;there's lots of little bits here and there that show an attention to detail,
&gt;but as you say, it doesn't gel. i still think it sounds like a splattered
&gt;canvas rather than a completed work, despite all the tiny bits that are
&gt;buried in the mix (like the wave sounds near the end).

you two heretics should be shot and burned.  splattered canvas my
butt!  i'll splatter a canvas with your entrails and then i'll smear
your blood on my face and do a nifty little interpretive war dance in
which i explain through the language of movement how totally way rad
bitchin' big stripy lie really is.

(actually i am getting kinda sick of it now but it's no splattered canvas.)

another engineering comment:  much as i love "lily", the drum sounds
are godawful!!  sound like they were broadcast into a cheap AM radio
which was then recorded via a radio shack condenser mic.  with a
fairlight and an akai s1000 you'd think she could've got some BOTTOM
END in there.

one last global comment (for now): john giblin's bass playing is
excellent, as always.  give the guy some props!

This calls for a very special blend of psychology and extreme violence.
