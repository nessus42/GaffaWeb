Hello, Earth,

Well, I've had The Red Shoes for a week now, and after a dozen or so listens
and a week of reading reviews, rants &amp; raves on Lovehounds, here are some
desperately needed comments:

o  This is the FIRST Kate album since Never For Ever that you can instantly
   say "Well, this one sure is better than the last one!"  OK, so The
   Dreaming is better than N4E, but (and I'm addressing fellow old-timers
   here), it took you awhile to figure that out, didn't it?

o  Even though The Red Shoes is better than The Sensual World, TSW is still
   a better album to make love to.

o  Some folks are whining that Kate's no good anymore 'cause it's not as
   good as The Dreaming or Hounds of Love.  I'ld like to see YOU make a
   couple of albums as good as good TD and HOL hen try to make something
   even better!  For that matter, I'ld like to see you try to make a couple
   of albums as good as TD or HoL!

o  Saying "Kate sucks" 'cause TSW and TRS aren't as good as TD and HOL is
   like saying The Beatles suck 'cause Magical Mystery Tour and Let it Be
   aren't as good as Sgt. Pepper or The White Album.

o  With Kate's legacy, she could put out a dozen albums of note-for-note
   covers of Menudo songs and STILL be the greatest musical genius of
   all time.

o  As for you who say "Sure, I love 'Hounds of Love', that doesn't mean
   I have to love 'The Red Shoes'."  True, but if you want to hear HoL,
   then play it!  The will never be another HoL;  TRS (and for that matter,
   TSW) are great albums in their own right!  If you want HoL Part II,
   you will be sadly dissapointed.  If you want a disc full of great music,
   TRS is a must-have.

Now, comments on heavily-discussed songs (and some changes of my previous
review):

o  I previously graded the title cut a "B" 'cause I didn't know where
   it was going, and when I knew I thought it took too long to get there.
   Now that I know the path, I think it's a great song.  Another 'A' for
   Kate!

o  "Why Should I Love You?" - I have to admit, this song really bites.
   For the first time on any Kate album, I routinely hit skip (if listening
   at home) or fast forward (if listening at work).  Old grade: C-
   New Grade:  D-  Easily Kate's worst non-remix song.  And it's not Prince's
   fault, either (if he was THAT much of an influence, it would have been
   called "Why Should I Love U?")  I thought the clever wordplay at the
   end could save it, but noooo....

o  Lily-  This is just me, but I have to disagree with the majority here;
   this song just doesn't do it for me.  Yeah, musically it's great
   but lyrically, it's a turn-off.  The only spiritual songs I like are
   "Dear God" by XTC and "Christianity is Stupid" by Negativland.

o  Constellation of The Heart has been getting a lot of bashing here;  I
   think it's a fun song, and I love the Dialog part.  It kinda reminds
   me of Waking the Witch, actually.  (Waking the Witch Lite?)

o  Song of Solomon has been also getting bad press here, a large part for
   THAT line.  All you sensitive Katefolk out there can't take being blunt.
   Me?  I don't think it's vulgar ENOUGH!  I think Kate should just YELL
   OUT the point of the whole song, and scream "Fuck me NOW!"

o  I'm starting to not dislike Eat the Music.

 the T of the toes
 the E of my eye
 the V of velvet
 the 0 of Oh my God, who kidnapped Kate and WROTE this trash?"
