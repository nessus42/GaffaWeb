Kath asks about the tall young man in the X4 video.  Yes, Kath, the
actor in question is indeed Hugh Laurie, the fellow who plays
(wonderfully) Bertram Wilberforce Wooster alongside Stephen Fry's
Jeeves. The two have been a comedy duo for years in England, and each
has done quite a lot on his own, as well.  (Also notice comedienne Dawn
French in the X4 video, as well as several distinguished UK philocanines!)

About disasters in California on KT album release dates: not just
California, as Peter can report.  Also, not necessarily all are
disasters -- September 13 (the day IED first got hold of the Eat the Music
single import from England) was also the day Rabin and Arafat shook
hands.  Still, the fall of the walls of Jericho is a pretty momentous event...

Bravo, Graham!  IED was wondering when someone would finally calm down from
the initial adolescent impulse to trash (mindlessly) Kate's new music
long enough to start LISTENING to it -- and thus to notice, for example, the
three "buried" spoken messages in "Lily", which IED has been trying to make
out for days now.  He almost agrees with you about the first two, but
he believes the full lines are something like "Here's Michael on your right!"
and "Uriel on your left!" or something like that.  As for the third,
later line, it stands out very clearly as a spoken sentence, but IED
has yet to make out a single word.  There are also messages on other
tracks, he believes.

As well as a touching inscription on the run-out groove of the vinyl
LP, which Kate almost certainly etched herself.

-- Andrew Marvick (IED)
   Btw, the album is inarguably the greatest piece of recorded music
to be released in at least the last four years.  All posted attempts to
convince otherwise have thus far failed miserably, and have succeeded
only in bringing shame and ridicule upon their authors.  It's interesting to
see with what desperate, passionate, feverish energy these persons rush 
to announce their boredom, indifference and disinterest.  Meanwhile, of
course, they fail utterly to see the Face of the Sun which shines so
brilliantly above them all the while...
