&lt;LOL&gt; Man... thats so funny :)  I like what you wrote but I guess cos I
was only a teenager in the 70s Im quite nostalgic for it... Not ALL of
it mind you.. but a lot of the music.  Some of the disco sure.. but also
the first times I heard some amazing music... I'll never forget the
first times I saw and heard Wuthering Heights, or hearing some of Elton
Johns best music, or Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody :)  So much great music..
a lot of it forgotten or "not included" in the 70s as we generalise
about how crap the decade was.  But every decade has its
crap..musically, politically, and certainly fashion-wise. So while
no-one in their right mind would stage a revival based on Charlie
Daniels Band (when the devil went down to Georgia he should have taken
Charlie with him and kept right on going!!&lt;G&gt;) and polyester.. but there
were some great things that are easy to forget because they are now
simply so familiar as to be wallpaper.  Try remembering the first time
you heard some great music of the 70s or a movie that really got to you,
or some clothes you really liked :)  Maybe now you dont feel the same
about any of it... but what the hell.. back then it was cool and fun.  I
guess nostalgia is something like a Disney-ised version of the world at
any given time period.  The 60s were done to death.. as were the 50s
(Happy Days anyone?? Not for me... god I was never fond of that decade
&lt;G&gt;)  and no doubt the 80s and 90s will get their turn. Perhaps the 80s
already are!! Oh well... enough ranting for now, I guess I just enjoyed
the 70s and growing up...specially from this safe distance!! Now I only
really have to remember the good bits

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I thought that was what the whole 70s revival thing was about.  :P
&gt;
&gt; GACK! No!  Anyone who actually was an adult in the 70's has firsthand
&gt; experience with how utterly, repulsively, disgustingly, horrible the
&gt; whole
&gt; thing was!
&gt;
&gt; Only another generation could be sentimental about the current,
&gt; Disney-ized
&gt; concept of the 70's -- ugh!  How can one possibly stage a revival
&gt; based on
&gt; polyester and the Charlie Daniels Band?
