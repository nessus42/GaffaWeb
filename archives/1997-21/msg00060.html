: From what I have heard of working closely with O{+&gt;, I credited
: their (KT &amp; O{+&gt;) 'long' (in O{+&gt; terms) working relationship to the
: possiblity that they had done all their collaborating via long
: distance...  (KT sends a tape, O{+&gt; sends it back with his changes.. 
: and so on)
: 
: O{+&gt;  is very controlling, obsessive, and (last I heard) a swirling 
: vortex of poor mental health.  I doubt KaTe with her sensitive nature 
: (from what I have observed) could have withstood prolong 'close' 
: contact with such a troubled soul/mind.
: 
: BTW, I heard "My Computer" over the weekend.... where's KaTe?  Oh,
: silly me... O{+&gt; CONSISTANTLY 'phases out' anyone who could possibly
: 'out shine' his royal musicalness... (or should I say Its royal
: musicalness, since O{+&gt; isn't even sure if the currently dominant
: personality that is 'in charge' is male or female... hence the
: symbol)
: 
: Don't get me wrong.. I am a fan of O{+&gt;'s stuff, especially the older 
: stuff (pre 1999), but his habit for cutting off anyone he percieves 
: as getting ANY kind of recognition due to their association with him 
: (Wendy / Lisa, Matt Bland, Rosie Gains, ..... and on and on), and his 
: increasing mental unbalance (which appears to be indulged, instead of 
: confronted by those around him), makes me irritated.
: 
: Wow, what a rant
: 


True, a rant it was?  Who is Matt Bland?  What do  you mean he lieks to
outshine his guests?  It's not like the two were ordered to work together,
I'm sure Prince asked Kate if she'd like to ssing on "my computer" and she
obviously wanted to.

I think that Prince mixed her vocals to the rear cuz he didn't want to try
and sell the album with a list of star studded guests.  Chante Moore sang
background for "la la la means i love u" also on the the third disc but
again yo'll have to strain to hear her. 
One more thing, Princ'e vocals on "why shouldI love you " aren't exactly
crystal clear.  You can definetly etell that he is singing though, just
like kate.  they both have very distinct voices,.
