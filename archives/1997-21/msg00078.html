&gt;So what if the messages are bleak and devoid of love? If that's what you
&gt;can relate to, go for it.
&gt;
&gt;"Emptiness is loneliness, and loneliness is cleanliness
&gt;And cleanliness is godliness, and god is empty just like me
&gt;Intoxicated with the madness, I'm in love with my sadness"
&gt;- "Zero" by The Smashing Pumpkins
&gt;
&gt;When I saw these guys play this song it was an incredible moment. The
crowd
&gt;erupted into a huge roar when Billy Corrigan proclaimed, "God is empty
just
&gt;like me." Amazing...and something you WON'T see at a Moody Blues concert.
&gt;
&gt;

i think the smashing pumpkins are incredibly talented...billy corgan has a
beautiful way with words. i went to one of their concerts and it was
fabulous...the opening of "tonight tonight" makes me shiver every time i
hear it. it was grand. even though i practically got trampled because we
were in the mosh pit...bad idea if you are a
 5' 2"  girl. 

being a high schooler (where your peers are oh so supportive of
differences...har.)  i was constantly ridiculed for my "weird" music,
simply because i was always listening to people that my classmates had
never heard of. most of them only knew what was on mtv or the radio! i do
like some things on the radio: smashing pumpkins, paula cole, nine inch
nails are some examples. but most of the music i listen to i have
discovered through my older friends or by just going to the little used
record store near me and picking up what i think looks interesting. i like
music that makes me think and makes me feel, something that washes over me
and touches my heart. that is why most of the stuff on the radio just does
not appeal to me...it does not leave an impression, it all sounds the
same. i think listening to kate has spoiled me...she is so incredible.
