&gt; It arrived yesterday!!! Just in time for KaTemas.. I gripped it in
&gt; both hands, eyes wide, and asked my SO, "should I save it for
&gt; KaTemas?"
&gt;
&gt; He shrugged, so I dived for the sterio..  WOW!! YES!!! I LOVE THOSE
&gt; PERCUSSIONS!!!  I pulled the old ratty lazy-boy into the middle of
&gt; the living room, right in the middle of the triangle of my two bose
&gt; speakers, and the base box...  poured a glass of wine, leaned back
&gt; with closed eyes and waited for the wonder of KaTe.  My favorite cat
&gt; leapt up into my lap to enjoy the music with me.. he purred and
&gt; purred...  I would have purred too.. I guess I might have..
&gt;
&gt; I listened as if it was the first time..  Got goosebumps during
&gt; RUTH, felt a pull at my gut during Cloudbusting, and got caught up
&gt; in the wonder of the Ninth Wave..  It sounded like KaTe was standing
&gt; right next to me.. the vocals so clear, the percusions so deep..
&gt;
&gt; However, I kept expecting to hear 'all sorts of things I never heard
&gt; before'.. as several Lovehounds had mentioned... alas.. I didn't hear
&gt; anything new..
&gt;
&gt; Then I remembered.. when HoL first came out, I was living with 4
&gt; other people who weren't as keen on KaTe as myself.. (hard to
&gt; belive, but true).. I listened to HoL everyday, once or twice, lying
&gt; on the floor, eyes closed, with HEADPHONES...  I Heard EVERYTHING..
&gt; I tested my theory by paying special attention to the bonus tracks..
&gt; YES!  by goddess, I hear all sorts of things I hadn't heard before!!
&gt;  I am running out to buy a set of headphones this weekend.. I can't
&gt; wait to rediscover all of the other KaTe KreaTions with
&gt; headphones....
&gt;
&gt; AND..
&gt;
&gt; Just in case KaTe tunes in....
&gt;
&gt; {my goddess, I am speechless... I have no idea how to even begin to
&gt; express my overwhelming admiration of the art you create}
&gt;
&gt; And what actually would be spoken with jaw on floor and eyes VERY
&gt; wide= 'ahhhhh, ahhhhhh, ahhhhhh,........'
&gt;
&gt; love, peace, and all things KaTe
&gt; d~

...If you're serious about that headphone thing, you may be in for a
pleasant surprise. Certainly I haven't looked at a wide selection
myself, but in 1994 I ran across something in a magazine mentioning some
in-the-ear phones from Etymotic Research. The reviewer said, in essence,
that they had the best sound of any phones *or speakers* he'd ever
heard. There's a link to ER on the "music" page of my site (URL is
below--check out the other artists too while you're at it.) There's also
a link to Headroom, which makes portable headphone amps so you can take
that Er sound on the road (or in the air). I can vouch for the fact
that, although the in-the-ear bit takes some getting used to, these
little jobbies do *kick butt*. The bass is unsurpassed. And yes, I do
plan to get the remastered *Hounds of Love* quite soon.
