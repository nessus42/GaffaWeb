WARNING!!!  BAD SPELLING AHEAD!!!

{snip "pop music sux" stuff}

&gt; I, for example, found Alanis (as reinvented by Glen Ballard) very fresh
&gt; the first few times I heard it -- then found myself "hating" her.  Was it
&gt; the overall shallowness of the angry white chick thing, or was it that
&gt; I'd just grown tired of it?

DITTO!!  Although I know why I grew tired of it (and fast)... I
discovered (late in her career) Ani DiFranco!!!!  HELLO!!....
Someone earlier mentioned that Alanis was the ORIGNIAL that Meridith
Brooks was the COPY of..... NO WAY!!!!!  Alanis wishes she was
1/10th as cool and orginal as Ani... In fact... I bet dollars to
donuts that Alanis was encouraged to imitate (and badly) Ani's style
by the label.  Ani has been recording records in her basement for
AGES under her own label (rightous babe (sp?)) to avoid the 
compromises demanded by a standard contract with major (and
sometimes minor) label.  Talk about integrity!  Then this little
nickelodian twerp straightens her hair, puts on some black clothes,
and heavy mascara and whines about her life.... a shadow of the
genius that is Ani DiFranco...  

To quote one of my favorite DJ's from the former Rev105.. (either 
Brian Oake or Thorn.. I can't remember which..)

"I've got one hand in my pocket / 
And the other one's chuckin' this lame CD out the window."

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;A lot of people are all too eager to get on a new artist's bandwagon.
&gt; &gt;Case in point:  Jewel.
&gt; 
&gt; True, but I don't know if it's a genuine "herd mentality" at play here,
&gt; or merely a matter of accessibility.  Either way, it doesn't mean she
&gt; "sucks".  Maybe you've just heard "Who Will Save Your Soul" a couple
&gt; hundred times too many.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; How the HELL can Jewel be a VH1 artist of the month....when she only
&gt; HAS 1 album????  
&gt; &gt;aarrgh!! 

How the HECk can she get NEW ARTIST last year??  That album is 2 or 3
years old!!!  AND all the singles appear to be re-recorded...  I bet
dollars to donuts that her label caught a whiff of the new O+ music
trend, dusted off her cd that had been put on the "didn't catch on in
the test market last year" pile, remixed with new vocals (deeper,
more confident than CD versions...) a couple tunes and PUSHED with
all their might.. glitzy video's for selling her on MTV.. VOLA!! add
water and mix.. instant 'star'.


&gt; Simple, she's hot right now and her 15 minutes aren't up yet.  What
&gt; better time to feature her as artist of the *MONTH*?  (We're not talking
&gt; about artist of the year or decade here.  VH1's artist of the month
&gt; profiles *today's* new sound -- with no regard to the artist's
&gt; longevity.)

HA! NEW?!  like I said... at least 2-3 years old.. been there, done 
est!

{Snip closing comments on hippie stoner music... :~)  }

d~  (WAY to irritated for a tuesday morning.. )
