&gt;To Don(gerous),
&gt;
&gt;Firstly, I could have written to you personally, but it's my feeling
&gt;that you like to discuss things
&gt;in the open and this also gives other people an opportunity to add their
&gt;views if they wish to.

Right. That's why we're on a mailing list.

&gt;It has just turned July 30 over here, so this seems to be a good moment
&gt;to say some words on Kate's behalf.

Oh, there's not enough said on her behalf on the list?

&gt;I think your continuous remarks on her being "lazy and not interested in
&gt;her career" do not have any foundation.

Really? You find her to be hard working and VERY interested in her career?
Interesting.

&gt; First some general points : music is a form of ART.

You mean like Celine Dion or the Spice Girls?

&gt; A genuine artist does not have a job.

I guess Kate Bush isn't a "genuine artist." She has a job...she makes
records for a living.

&gt;In the ideal situation the artist should produce by inspiration, not by
&gt;demand.

Okay.

&gt;Unfortunately in real
&gt;life there are great demands on the artists, also in the music industry.

Okay.

&gt;A true artist will always
&gt;try to let inspiration prevail over demand.

And a wise artist will set demand provide inspiration. Many great songs
were written "on demand." One of my favorites is "I Need You" by The Who.
In fact, most songs in the '60s were written "on demand." Release and
recording schedules were TIGHT!

&gt;Now for Kate : I think we agree that she belongs to this relatively
&gt;small group of genuine artists.

Not by your definition. She's got a job.

&gt;She is in the fortunate position, because of her early successes, to
&gt;withstand the demands as much as possible. I am happy for her.

And I think it's a mixed blessing.

&gt;You seem to resent it. Why?

I don't resent it. I think that if she got out in the real world more that
she would get inspiration from sources she had been previously unaware of.
Do you consider that a bad thing?

&gt; Why is she not entitled to live her life
&gt;the way she wants?

Of course she's entitled to live her life the way she wants. No one has
said otherwise.

&gt; We know very little about her personal feelings, so
&gt;how can you make all those bold
&gt;statements about what she should be doing and who she should work with?

Easy. I'm living my life the way I want, and that means I can post whatever
I want. Am I not entitled to live my life the way I want?

As a fan, I'm entitled to make any observations and suggestions about one
of my favorite hit record makers if I am so inclined. If I think that the
Dust Brothers should produce her next album (and they should), then I'll
post that. You, OTOH, are free to defend to death the status quo.

&gt;Why do you want to turn this
&gt;unique woman into just another rock chick who duly plays the game like
&gt;all the others?

I don't. However, after 20 years of hibernation, it's time for Kate to come
out of her cave. According to most people on this group (though not me),
"The 9th Wave" is her peak. According to many others, "The Red Shoes" is
her nadir. That means KB's on a twelve year slide, with "The Sesual World"
the only stop in the middle.

One thing I really like about the "Love And Anger" video is the sequence at
the end where she seems to be performing (quite happily, mind you) in a
club, without all the suplerflous stuff around her such as costumes,
choreography and dancers (she's been there and done that, I'd like to see
something different, now). How about if we get her to tour with The
Magnolias as her backing band? May I suggest she play The Doll Hut in Santa
Ana, CA, and Jack's Sugar Shack in Hollywood? Yes, I may. And, Albert, you
may defend her no-tour policy.

&gt;If you had been her manager from the start

She never would have made it.

&gt; and Kate had not been the strong personality
&gt;that she is,

She never would have made it.

&gt; I'm sure she would have been burnt out very quickly,
&gt; like so many before and after her.

Doubtful. I don't think a strong work ethic burns people out.

&gt;I really hope she will produce a few more musical masterpieces, I feel
&gt;she has some left in her.

As long as she keeps putting out great singles, I'll be happy.

&gt;But please, let her decide if and when she wants to give them to us.

Let her? Do you think I have any say?

- Don
