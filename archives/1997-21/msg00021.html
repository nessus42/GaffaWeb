     Perhaps I should attempt to make it clearer, when I refer to 
     Pre-Collins, I refer to the point at which he started singing for the 
     band.
     
     For reference, can anyone see below where I'm critisising the Sputniks 
     competance as musicians - I just missed them of my all time favourite 
     top ten!

&gt;     Hi List
&gt;
&gt;     Just been reading all your notes about how great music used to be, and 
&gt;     apparently how crap and depressing it has all become.
&gt;
&gt;     About 5 years ago I got involved with a London based band called
&gt;     Moondigger (I know you've never heard of them).  I guess some of the 
&gt;     chops and licks leant some of their attitude towards artists like
&gt;     Franc Dunnery, Alan Holdsworth, Pre Collins Genesis
     
Pre-Collins Genesis? Shoot, he was with the band since "Nursery Cryme." 
What made "Trespass" and "Revelation" all that superior?
     
&lt;snip&gt;
     
&gt;     At the same time Kate was producing the miracle that is HOL, Sigue
&gt;     Sigue Sputnik were releasing their efforts to the world.  There will 
&gt;     always be good and bad.  It's up to you and you're tastes to decide 
&gt;     which you think is which.
     
Hey! Hey! Hey! What's wrong with Sigue Sigue Sputnik. They were supposed to 
be a fun band and they succeeded tremendously. Not every band has to be 
"serious" or have "good chops."
     
Plus, they were absolutely amazing live. It was a hilarious multi-media 
extravaganza.
     
Find another band to pick on.
