"...the tools needed 
to make a good recording are much, much cheaper and better than they 
used to be, but they're still quite expensive and take a while to 
acquire on your average young person's salary--something I know, 
since I'm in that position. At least now, however, they are a 
possibility, though it may take a few years to afford them."

A four track multitrack is less than $250.  A decent microphone 
costs more.  My first four track (3440 Teac) cost me four months
salary (about $3500).    It takes having a job and a bit of credit.  
Will that make a star of you?  Probably not, but 67% of the 
albums released sell less than a thousand copies.  80% if the 
money goes to 3% of the people who try.  Don't do it for the 
money.  Don't do it for free.  Get something you want.  Look 
at it like this;  a lot of people move here from India to work 
because America is wealthy and India is not.  Yet,  
here I am listening to bhajans, ragas, and ghazals.    Why?  
I have 12 notes and they have 22.  Rich is what one doesn't have.
Were the Sadhus the poorest or the wealthiest of men, Renee?

In terms of the Business, paganism is a Local event.  Yes, I do 
know something about it.  Let me say, at a certain 
changing, I heard life sing the song of liberation and surrendered.
May your magic be as sweet as my daughter's laughter, 
and your power as tender as her kiss.

Hear the old robber's song, Sita of the furrow.
When it is time to sit sadly in the forest, as you watch the 
golden deer at bow's length, while the rain falls about you 
like the dark locks fall about your shoulders, 
when Durga's voice chills even your lord's arms, 
do well to know that you are the light and be warm.

"...it seems that the newer bands just can't
play their instruments....They bang them...but they can't "play".  The
messages that come across are often bleak ..." 

Stanley Jordan (as I recall) once said he liked to cover the Beatles 
because one couldn't help but do a better job instrumentally.   On the
other hand, Duane Allman played every lick credited to his name and a
few credited to Eric Clapton (which Clapton admits).  I have to agree 
that guitar chops have been down, but rock tears itself back 
to basics every 15 to 20 years while kids learn the blues.  Then 
they work their way back up the variants.  Wait for it.

Music of anger and angst are overwhelming out there.  I wonder why.  
I am way past that part of my life where I struck out against the 
shadow man under my bed.  I remember him, but I learned to boogie 
with the BadDude.  Still, I have to agree with you Ron, that when 
I've been to the Mosh Pit scene, I have to wonder just what is 
eating these folks.   Whatever t'is, it is a weird contrast.  The 
"sixties" (1962 to 1972), were a period of incredible creativity 
in music, and yet, a period of awful death and inhumanity at 
least, from the perspective of growing up on this side of the pond. 
Now, we have period of peace, mindbending prosperity, and some of 
the most depressed music I've ever heard.  Maybe it's the heroin, 
maybe it's the tube, maybe it's the boredom.  Frankly, since a 
lot of X'ers *(whatever ... didn't care for freak or hippie much
myself), 
are here, it would be good to hear what you think.

time to polish my cane..... and beat old Nag.
