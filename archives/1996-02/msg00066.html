&gt;If someone were to ask me the single best Kate site
&gt;on the web as of this writing, I would have to say it's
&gt;Richard Caley's HTMLized version of "Cloudbusting":

&gt;<A  HREF="http://scott.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~rjc/hyper_cloud/cloudbusting.html">http://scott.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~rjc/hyper_cloud/cloudbusting.html</A>

&gt;One problem I've always had with Ron Hill's original version
&gt;of Cloudbusting was it was almost entirely just a bunch of
&gt;interviews.  Nothing can make a KateFan wince like reading
&gt;an interview with her.  For example, here's someone interviewing
&gt;a normal musician:

&gt;Interviewer:  Before we start, I have to say I really enjoyed your
&gt;new album.
&gt;Artist:  Thank you!
&gt;Interviewer:  So, how did you (etc. etc.)

&gt;Here's the same interviewer with Kate:

&gt;Interviewer:  Before we start, I have to say I really enjoyed your
&gt;new album.
&gt;Kate:  You did?!?  Thank you!  Really!  Wow!  That's the nicest
&gt;thing anyone's ever said to me!  (get teary-eyed).  I mean it.  You're 
&gt;just too kind.  Really.  (starts tearing off clothes, jumps on interviewer) 
&gt;Oh, Let me have your children!

&gt;(Note:  This actually happened when Kate was interviewed by
&gt;Lovehounds creator |&gt;oug)

&gt;Anyway, what Richard did was cleverly made links to key words,
&gt;so if you wanted to know everything Kate said about, say,
&gt;"Pickles", it would do a search on that.  Sure, you could do that
&gt;with a flat ascii file and any half decent text editor, but that's not
&gt;as neat now, is it?  Plus, common things (such as individual
&gt;songs and albums) are specially highlighted, making it an easy
&gt;task for the Kateologist to find what they want.

&gt;Now, all this alone would make "Cloudbusting: The Web Site" an
&gt;invaluable resource.  But Richard went those extra steps, and
&gt;added other great resources (such as one of the better link pages) not
&gt;available in the original Cloudbusting.

&gt;This Cloudbusting is DEFINATELY something good!

&gt;Rating: *****

&gt;- To be continued


Agreed.  It's my favorite page too.  But last I browsed there, the
"Hounds Of Love" album page still has not been fixed.  Instead of the
tracks of the album (which you can then click on to hear Kate's
comments on those tracks) all that's listed is a B side of hers,
"Handsome Cabin Boy."  With the exception of the singles, "Running Up
That Hill," "Cloudbusting," "The Big Sky," and "Hounds Of Love," I
cannot access anything she has said for the rest of the songs.  Argh!

The Storm

We all have a dream . . . maybe?
