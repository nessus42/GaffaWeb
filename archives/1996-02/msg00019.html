Hello Chris (and I'm sure others will be interested),

&gt; Could someone please give me the songs featured on these two videos?  I would 
&gt; like to know the track listing before I purchase them.

Here's what I generated from a kind soul who posted each song and which
videos contained them, I converted it into a tabular form, hopefully easier
to look up, it should help you out, it helped me to decide to evenutally
buy "The Single File", even though I had "The Whole Story", which as you
will see includes a lot from it. I just "needed" the others, that I'd only
a vague memory of. I'd still like TSW video, maybe for my birthday! If I
can get it!
