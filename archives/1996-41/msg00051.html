&gt; ---This "Manhattan" line was (is? I never went for it) one of the

&gt;    most of the credits missing, to my ears, hearing a friend's 
&gt;    Manhattan CD, the music quality itself is poorer than original 
&gt;    EMI (import) or original American releases. 

Yes, you are correct.  The sound quality is not even up to par with my 
old LPs.  I have been meaning to "upgrade" to CDs for some time, and when 
I read the posting recently that mentioned the rumour of these CDs being 
deleted in US soon, I went and grabbed them up, not realizing that they 
were on the dreaded EMI-Manhattan label.  Oh well, at least I have them.

&gt; ---Ugh. Sorry to hear that you could actually get "used" to this. 
&gt;     Especially considering that it's Kate! :) 

Well, what I meant was that almost all of the CDs that I buy are reissues 
of my old LPs (older recordings), and although sometimes the record 
labels do a tremendous job in these by adding tracks, adding printed 
material, etc., MANY times there is just the two-sided card as an insert, 
with all the recording info and such gone.  When I say I am "used to it", 
I mean I am more numb to the fury that I used to feel!  Haha.  I buy alot 
of classical music also, and EMI are notorious for their crappy job of 
reissues - shameless!  And they are VERY quick to delete items from their 
catalog, so you better get 'em while they're hot!  That is why I did not 
doubt the rumour of deletion of Kate's albums from EMI.  But actually, 
maybe some other label will pick them up and do them service, eh?

&gt; ---Man, Jeff, you've got some patience.  It is a VERY big deal 
&gt;    to me. Consumers must demand their money's worth. I think many 
&gt;    people complaining is the best way to change things. I believe 
&gt;    that MCA was forced to upgrade their cheap rereleases because of 
&gt;    public outcry.  

Well, I am glad that outcry does work occasionally, but I don't think it 
works very often, especially for out-of-the-way specialty niche artists 
and for things like classical and jazz, which sell relatively low volumes.

&gt;    May I suggest that your next CD be the Japanese release of 
&gt;    _Lionheart_?  You simply will not (cannot) be dissatisfied.  :-) 

Thanks for the recommendation, for that is one Kate LP I haven't upgraded 
to CD yet.

Jeff
