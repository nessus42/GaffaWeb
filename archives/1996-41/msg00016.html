In article &lt;009A98CF.515AD300.448@uhavax.hartford.edu&gt;, 
billings@uhavax.hartford.edu says...
&gt;
&gt;I think that reading what all of you people write is so cool!  Someone asked
&gt;about Bjork, and I must say that she is one of my favorite artists.  In the
&gt;ROLLING STONE ENCYCLOPEDIA of ROCK, they write that Kate has influenced such
&gt;artists as Tori Amos, Bjork, Dolores O'Riordan of Cranberries, Sinead 
O'Connor,
&gt;and Jane Siberry.  With the exception of Jane, who I haven't heard yet, I 
have
&gt;albums by all of these artists.  Sinead is one of my favs., so I'd like to 
know
&gt;what you all think of her.  Another artist I like is Madonna, and I'd prefer
&gt;not to hear a lot of insults; I'm just mentioning her because she is the only
&gt;artist I really love that was not mentioned in the other group.  Kate, 
however,
&gt;came before all of these women, and I fall more in love with her every day.  
I
&gt;am doing my best to introduce my friend Sarah to her.  I taped THE KICK 
INSIDE
&gt;for her and sent it to her via mail.  Last night she called and told me how
&gt;much she loved it, so I'll be trying some other stuff out on her.  Another
&gt;interesting thing is that I played several tracks from THE DREAMING for my
&gt;friend Becka, and she really liked them.  And TD is supposed to be the one
&gt;that is "inaccessable" to a lot of people, right?  At least that is the case
&gt;according to what I've read.  Finally, I'd like to say that I listened to 
LION-
&gt;HEART today and definitely think it has its moments.  Comments?  have fun
&gt;folks,
&gt;
&gt;shane

Hey Shane!

Don't worry about the Madonna bit.  It's completely understandable--Bjork 
writes for her (Bedtime Story), and you like Bjork, right?

How's life at the old U. of H.?  I'm a former W. Hartford resident m'self.

Keep writing--we love new voices!
