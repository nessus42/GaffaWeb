&gt; &gt; if this is old hat.  One thing, though - from the interviews I have read or
&gt; &gt; seen with her, she seems to be a bit of a flake personally - a little to
&gt; &gt; into psychobabble and 'deep thoughts' for my taste.  Perhaps it all just
&gt; &gt; stems from some of her unfortunate experiences, but still it gets hard to
&gt; &gt; take after a while.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I'm a huge fan of both Tori and Kate, and I was amazed when the first
&gt; Tori album, "Little Earthquakes" came out.  They both have four letters
&gt; in their first and last names.  The thing that jumped out and grabbed me
&gt; was that they are both inside a wooden box in the photography on their
&gt; first albums!  But, the only thing that I thought even sounded remotely
&gt; like Kate was the song "Happy Phantom".
&gt;   On to if Tori has acknowledged any influence.  I have read many, many
&gt; interviews with Tori, and she has never mentioned Kate Bush.  I read a
&gt; short (very short) Details interview with Kate where she said that she
&gt; has never heard Tori's music, but heard that it was quite good.  I think
&gt; that Kate was obviously an influence on Tori, but Tori is reluctant to
&gt; admit it for some reason.


I agree with much of this assessment -- but have to add that 
Tori has mentioned Kate in a few interviews with varying degrees 
of praise. She thought that RuTH was a perfectly crafted record 
(and has recently taken to singing a line from it in concert). 
She's admitted that she and Kate "could probably sing each 
other's stuff" but asserted (hopefully jokingly) that Kate 
"smokes a lot more weed" than she does. And finally, she said 
that she wishes Kate would "stop screaming...there's no mouse."

Kate has heard a Tori song and said that it "was...umm...nice."
I don't know what that song was.
