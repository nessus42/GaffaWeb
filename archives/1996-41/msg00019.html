&gt;  Those who disparage Lionheart are usually fans
&gt;who never felt the magic of the album *in November 1978*.

Spot on! I think you have a very valid point here.

I was fortunate enough to be in my late teens when 'Wuthering Heights'
was released, thus I have heard each single and album release in
chronological order. 'Lionheart' may not have been so well received by
the critics as 'The Kick Inside', but I certainly had no complaints. 
'Symphony In Blue' was a delightful opener, with some beautiful
melodies, and I love the childlike 'In Search Of Peter Pan', especially
the way Kate sings 'second star on the right, straight on 'til
morning...' Of course, everybody knows 'Wow' - and I'd be amazed if
anyone said they didn't like it. (Actually listening to it as I write -
what a great atmospheric song it is!)
Without going through every track I would also highlight 'Oh England My
Lionheart' (beautiful track, whether you come from England or not -
loved the way Kate sang it on the Hammersmith video), and 'In The Warm
Room' - gorgeous vocals.

&gt;IED's long search for the new import album during that fall in Los
&gt;Angeles, the instant when he finally laid hands on the thing and was
&gt;taken wondrously aback by its mysterious cover photograph, and the
&gt;moment when the sacred objeKT finally sounded forth on his old
&gt;phonograph, are experiences for which he is forever grateful.

I know what you mean exactly. Excuse me while I cough and pretend that I
don't have a lump in my throat...

&gt;Remember that in 1978 the sound of that voice and the quality of the
&gt;album's production were still rare and novel, and that very little was
&gt;yet known about Kate Bush at all in this country.  By knowing Kate's
&gt;subsequent achievements we are all inclined to affix the stamp of
&gt;relative rank to each, and in such a competition what music could hope
&gt;to compete -- even Kate's own Lionheart?  But even the "lesser books of
&gt;the Bible" are endowed, so IED hears, with the grace of God.
&gt;

I agree completely.
 
If you discovered Kate well after 'Lionheart' - particularly if 'The
Dreaming' was your initiation - then it can be difficult to appreciate
just how advanced her early work was in comparison to many other artists
at the time, especially considering her age. If you don't have it in
your collection then go and get it right away - you won't regret it. If
you do have it, but haven't played it for a while, here's what you do:
Wait until evening, turn the lights down low, chill out with your
favourite drink, relax, close your eyes, and just let it flow right
through you...

['Wow' has just finished. Flip back to 'Symphony..' - just got to hear
it once more before I turn in for the night. Nearly 1 a.m.. Mmmm. Excuse
me while I drift away...]
