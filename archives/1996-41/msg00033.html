&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm baffled at the use of And So Is Love, as the visuals are dull -- well,
&gt; &gt;&gt; as dull as looking at Kate's face for 4 minutes and 18 seconds could
&gt; &gt;&gt; ever be -- and the sequence doesn't advance the story one jot.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Although IED appreciates the qualification in the criticism above, and
&gt; &gt;while he hastens to add that IED has greatly enjoyed all of Richard's
&gt; &gt;intelligent and thought-provoking postings in this group,
&gt; 
&gt; I just can't keep from reading this line over and over again.  It is
&gt; incredibly flattering, especially considering the source.  And undeserved.
&gt; I'm not worthy!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;he is forced
&gt; &gt;to object to the notion that the "And So Is Love" section of TLTCTC
&gt; &gt;is just empty visuals that serve no purpose in the film.  On the contrary,
&gt; &gt;this is one of the most intriguing sections of the movie, in IED's view,
&gt; &gt;and though not exactly an action scene, it does indeed extend, complicate and
&gt; &gt;advance the thematic program of the whole.  Far
&gt; &gt;from simply a four-minute fix on Kate Bush herself, the clip reveals
&gt; &gt;several fascinating interlinking symbols and images that offer the
&gt; &gt;first key to the larger meaning of the story; and it also puts an entirely
&gt; &gt;new perspective on the meaning not only of the song as heard originally on
&gt; &gt;the album, but on the entire album itself.
&gt; 
&gt; Please elaborate on this.  If there is more to this sequence than meets the
&gt; eye, I certainly want to know about more about it, and would be entirely
&gt; happy to be proved wrong!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Those who disparage Lionheart are usually fans
&gt; &gt;who never felt the magic of the album *in November 1978*.  IED's long
&gt; &gt;search for the new import album during that fall in Los Angeles, the instant
&gt; &gt;when he finally laid hands on the thing and was taken wondrously aback by
&gt; &gt;its mysterious cover photograph, and the moment when the sacred objeKT
&gt; &gt;finally sounded forth on his old phonograph, are experiences for which he
&gt; &gt;is forever grateful.   Remember that in 1978 the sound of that voice and
&gt; &gt;the quality of the album's production were still rare and novel, and that
&gt; &gt;very little was yet known about Kate Bush at all in this country.  By knowing
&gt; &gt;Kate's subsequent achievements we are all inclined to affix the stamp of
&gt; &gt;relative rank to each, and in such a competition what music could hope
&gt; &gt;to compete -- even Kate's own Lionheart?  But even the "lesser books
&gt; &gt;of the Bible" are endowed, so IED hears, with the grace of God.
&gt; 
&gt; Reading these perceptive words reminded me of the strange story of how I
&gt; first came to acquire a copy of Lionheart.  Have I bored everyone here with
&gt; that story?  Can I just?  Cheers.
&gt; 
&gt; At the start of 1979, I happened to be corresponding with a radio DJ in
&gt; Australia.  (How I came to know a DJ in Australia is a long and not
&gt; particularly relevant story.)  In a letter to this DJ friend of mine, I
&gt; mentioned my extreme fondness for this British singer called Kate Bush, and
&gt; asked if he had ever heard of her.  A few weeks later I received a totally
&gt; unexpected package from him: it was, you will have guessed, a copy of
&gt; Lionheart.  It turned out that he had sent me the official playing copy of
&gt; Lionheart from his own radio station...because, he explained, he absolutely
&gt; despised Kate Bush, could not stand the sound of her voice, and sending the
&gt; album to another country seemed like a good way to make sure his station
&gt; would never play the damned thing again!
&gt; 
&gt; The loss of possibly thousands of radio listeners in Western Australia was
&gt; my gain.  If anyone reading this lived in the area of Perth during 1979, my
&gt; deepest apologies.  I can't possibly repay you.  I was never able to repay
&gt; my benefactor for his generosity on my behalf -- hey, he could simply have
&gt; dumped it in the rubbish bin, rather than posting it to America at his own
&gt; expense! -- however misguided his motives may have been.  (This DJ
&gt; subsequently went on to become a moderately successful television
&gt; correspondent for the ABC, so for all I know he may be a major celebrity
&gt; over there by now...)

&gt; &gt; Actually, Mike Nesmith continues to produce videos.  His company is Pacific

&gt; 
&gt; Uh,  no. Not any more. Seems I heard that Pacific Arts went bottoms up

&gt; &gt; &gt;I also remember that that Saturday morning show also showed Skippy
&gt; &gt; &gt;the Bush Kangaroo so of course I thought Kate "Bush"  was from Australia and
&gt; &gt; &gt;only found out in 1985 that she was in fact English !!!!
&gt; 
&gt; "Skippy the Bush Kangaroo" is mentioned in the KLF track "Kylie said to Jason",
&gt; along with some other TV shows like "The Archie Bunkers Show" and "Some Mothers

&gt; 
&gt; Things are stirring, at last.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Alan Parsons is currently on tour in the USA. At a post-concert meet
&gt; &gt;and greet for members of the official fan club, Stuart Elliott (AP band
&gt; &gt;member and long time Kate collaborator) mentioned that he'd received a
&gt; &gt;phone call from Kate just before leaving for the tour enquiring about
&gt; &gt;his availability for studio work...
&gt; 
&gt; I know that this is the second posting mentioning this but is it only
&gt; me who gets an adrenaline kick out of this kind of news?
&gt; 
&gt; Where there's smoke there's fire, i hope.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone heard any other news, indicating that an album is not too
&gt; distant (say in about four years time;)) in the future?
&gt; 
&gt; Haven't heard anything from Homeground about it but maybe You guys know?

&gt; 
&gt; Hi there.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Am I the only one who REALLY likes this cd??
&gt; 
&gt; No you're not. I didn't discover KT with TSW but still find it to
&gt; be one of her best efforts to date.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that the reason for many KT-fans not liking it is that the
&gt; expectations on the album after her masterpiece HoL, was HUGE.
&gt; 
&gt; Many (me included) were hoping for something along the lines of
&gt; a double-concept-album and were, initially, disappointed.
&gt; 
&gt; But, as her male counterpart, she moves in mysterious ways.
&gt; 
&gt; Many of my un-initiated friends find this to be her best album, and
&gt; if you don't count HoL i have to agree.
&gt; 
&gt; Marcus.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;7. Sensual World. Time Magazine gave this album a two-word review: Press
&gt; &gt;&gt;Delete.
&gt; &gt;Am I the only one who REALLY likes this cd??
&gt; 
&gt; No Patrick, you are not.  I also think this is one of my favorite CDs,
&gt; because it is just "like butta", as Mike Myers would say.  Anyway, it is
&gt; one of those CDs that once it starts playing, I don't move until the whole
&gt; thing is over.  The same is true for The Dreaming and Hounds of Love.
&gt; 
&gt; On another topic, I know that Kate did a version of Donovan's "Lord of the
&gt; Reedy River".  I am a big fan of Donovan also.  Does Kate acknowledge
&gt; anywhere any influence or any special enthusiasm for Donovan's work, or was
&gt; this just a one-shot off-the-wall thing?  Just curious.

I am a new subscriber, but of course I have been a huge Kate Bush fan
for years and years...This post is really for RAB who doesn't see the
significance of "And So Is Love" in TLTCTC.  Don't you see the bird that
dies during that song later in the movie in her hair?  That is highly
symbolic.
Try and watch for other symbolic gestures--they are there!

On another note, I love hearing about other Kate Bush fanatics--in my
area I have never met one!
