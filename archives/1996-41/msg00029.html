Hi everyone, 

I've been catching up on L-H digests, and must have glossed 
over these completely unfair and harmful comments dared by 
ttuerff@primenet.com (Tom Tuerff):

&gt; 6. Lionheart. Can you say, "Sophomore Curse?" Kate doesn't like this
&gt;    album,

Talk about stretching things! I have never read of Kate saying 
such a thing.  Besides, who CARES what Kate says about her albums!?  
I don't happen to like some of my early technical manuals anymore, 
but that doesn't mean that they weren't useful for some customers 
and still may be! 

&gt; and neither do most people.

How in the H* did you come to this conclusion?  For one thing, this 
statement is completely misleading: NONE of Kate's albums are, as 
you intimate, "completely disliked" by her fans! I invite anyone except 
Stev0 who really does not like the entire _Lionheart_ album to come 
forward and embarrass themselves. The album contains some of Kate's
greatest 
songs (SiB, CH, DPYFOTH, etc.). How you can completely diss this 
album is simply ridiculous and unfair to Kate or her fans, especially
new fans.

&gt; Even in early fan magazines, this album 
&gt; was always people's least favorite.

"Least favorite" I can take.  Dumb, but I can take it... 

&gt; But, that was before she recorded...

7. Sensual World. Time Magazine gave this album a two-word review: 
   Press Delete. (It's a reference to one of the songs on the album.) 
   I couldn't agree more, 

ROTFL!  So, that bastion of popular music review, "Time Magazine,"
didn't like _TSW_.  Ha ha!   I hear "People" magazine didn't even 
review the disc; this must truly mean that the album is worthless.
You couldn't agree more, huh?  How sad. "Love and Anger" is Kate's 
greatest work, imho this week... 

:^)  May I suggest that you rely on real music magazines as to 
     whether you should try a new album release. :) Time?? ROTFL! 

&gt;   but you'll find that those people who discovered Kate with this album
&gt;   tend to place it higher. 

That happens.  And it's fine!  My first Kate was _Lionheart_.  If I
had to actually "rank" her albums, _Lionheart_ would end up near the
bottom, but for Kate's sake, this does NOT mean that I don't like it!
