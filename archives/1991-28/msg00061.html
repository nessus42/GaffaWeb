<PRE>
	Like the first rain after a drought, a Love-Hounds Digest for Sunday, 
August 11 just posted.  I was beginning to get paranoid:  last Tuesday, August 
August 6, I had posted a reply to Jon Drukman, but Wednesday 8/7 there was no 
digest.  And indeed for the next six days, total drought.  Including no reply 
from love-hounds-request@eddie.mit.edu, or wisner@ims.alaska.edu.  Either the 
lh digest was broken, or I had been purged.  Damn!  Bandy words with Drukman, 
and the whole machine spits you out!  Paranoia threatened to set in.

	Tonight's new digest indicates I was not alone.  I am going to re-post 
my apparently lost post from Tuesday night separately, but I would like to 
comment on Richard Caldwell's suggestion that perhaps the technical 
arrangement in place between rec.music.gaffa on USENET and love-
hounds@eddie.mit.edu on INTERNET needs to be reconsidered.

	I have no access to USENET and have never been able to touch base with 
gaffa direct.  I don't even begin to comprehend what sort of a thing USENET is 
so I can't really make any informed technical comments about whatever happened 
this past week.  But I do remember |&gt;oug Alan taking the side of those of us 
who only see the exchanges of the newsgroup via the Digest a couple of years 
ago, and I would like to speak again on behalf of those of us who are in that 
boat.  I would guess that we are in the majority, though no numbers have 
recently been circulated.  Under the Bill Wisner regime, the Digest has been 
totally regular and dependable, with this the first and only technical fiasco 
(whatever it was).  I hope that no technical maneuver that would disadvantage 
the Digest subscribers will be necessary in the aftermath.

	The lapse in our conversation has been traumatic enough that whatever 
response is appropriate, I hope that an explanation in enough detail is 
forthcoming for us to share in any recommendations for changes of policy and 
practice.
