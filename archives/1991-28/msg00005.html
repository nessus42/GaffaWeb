&gt;Vickie here. The line that was suspended in gaffa in my last post
&gt;was that someone called "Feel It" "somphmoric drivel", 

That was me, although more specifically I likened "Feel It" to the
"soppy teenage puppy-love drivel" that a previous poster had written
about.  "Feel It" just doesn't do anything for me, and my wife and I
both find it kind of silly.  Of course, these are just my humble
opinions.  (Boy, am I going to get flamed for this!)

For that matter, there are several KB songs which I don't like much,
and I have gone so far as to program them out (with the help of a
programmable CD player) so that I never hear them.  However, I still
consider Ms. Bush to be one of the most talented musicians I've heard.
Once again, this is simply my personal taste, and the fact that I am
not really a KB fanatic.

As I also said in one of my rec.music.misc postings, my wife and I are
Kate Bush fans, although not fanatics.  Both of our wedding rings are
inscribed with the phrase "with a kiss I pass the key."  My favorite
KB song is "Houdini", and I fealt that that phrase summed up my
feelings for the marriage.  My wife wanted to include a phrase from a
Johnny Clegg &amp; Savuka song ("I think I know why the dog howls at the
moon"), but it wouldn't fit in her ring, so she went with the KB lyric
too.  (And yes, I know it isn't an *exact* quote from "Houdini", but
the change of tense fit the ring a bit better, IMHO.)

&gt;that's what I meant when I said I hear things like that and can't help
&gt;but feel a bit elitist.

I am not sure what you mean by this; could you elaborate?

Also, I apologize for not carrying over the rec.music.misc discussion
to the rec.music.gaffa group.  On the other hand, I got flamed for it
there by a die-hard KB fan, and I suspected it would be a lot worse in
this group.  (Hmmmm, now where *DID* I put my asbestos suit?  I hope it
still fits! ;-)

&gt;See what I get for writing on-line? Total confusion :-)

"Total confusion" is the name of the game.  UseNet has been likened to
an anarchic entity, after all!

	Bound to drown, and paler than you've even been...

Christopher Lishka       It is not safe out here.  It is wonderous, with
Wisconsin Group, CERN    treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross.
