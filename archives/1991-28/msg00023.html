    Richard Caldwell and others warned us that the net was
hiccuping lately
and that not everybody got our last post. I would have had this
sooner but I
was out of town, anyway here's an edited post:

&gt;   Regarding the list of KB fan clubs/zines that Richard
&gt;Caldwell posted, we can do some clarifying. BlowAway is indeed
&gt;retired, though Jackie might do the occasional KB related
&gt;publication of some sort after she is through with her schooling.
&gt;At the moment the only place to read Jackie's work would be in
&gt;the September (upcoming) Little Light, as she has joined Little
&gt;Light's staff. Lone Star Lionhearts is still around in theory.
&gt;We are in pretty close contact with Kevin Hendryx, the person
&gt;in charge there. The latest issue of LSL _is_ over two months
&gt;late, and LSL as a fan club is not very active, but there is
&gt;no evidence that Kevin has yet given up.

    Jeff Medkeff called Kevin on July 15 and reports that work on
their
latest issue seems to be progressing but that Kevin _is_ somewhat
discouraged
with the response to LSL.

&gt;We are trying to reach
&gt;Reaching Out USA but they haven't published in about six months.
&gt;There address is:
&gt;           P.O. Box 154
&gt;           Newton, MA  02168
&gt;   There is a Reaching Out in Canada but we know nothing about
&gt;them. Near as we can tell, Watching Storms didn't used to be
&gt;Little Earth, which is still in publication at the same address
&gt;as WS. Little Earth is sort of a WS 'greatest hits', featuring
&gt;mostly reprints from WS.

&gt;   AATHP's video party will be held on August 24, 1991, at
&gt;the Goodyear Party Room in the Downtown Holiday Inn, Akron. Many
&gt;of the people who went to the convention will be attending and
&gt;of course Love-Hounds are invited to attend at discount admission.

    We are providing discounts to anyone who is a member of any KB
fan club or
who subscribes to any KB newsletter.

&gt;While no profits are expected, as usual any we may garner will
&gt;be donated to Amnesty International in Kate's name unless
&gt;anybody has a better idea. There will be the expected rare videos
&gt;as well as a couple unexpected ones, and refreshments will be
&gt;served _in abundance_, all this to start at 1:00 PM (though
&gt;anybody who wants to come early will find us there at about ten).
&gt;We project this event will not be worth travelling a great
distance
&gt;for and expect primarily Midwesterners to attend.

&gt;   The latest Little Light is out and I will be posting
&gt;several articles from it onto this net, so that everybody can
&gt;see what we are all about. Jeff Medkeff has converted
&gt;his files to something my machine can read, and I will post
&gt;parts of the issue gradually.

    _That_ was a false alarm. We meant for it to be out but there
was a
problem at the distributor's, but this time it is well and truly
out, as you all know.

&gt;   To the dozen or so people who have asked where we got the
&gt;name Gesundheit! for our new newsletter, it has to do with the
&gt;working title thereof. "AATHPnews" was the working title for a
&gt;month or so until somebody decided that sounded like a sneeze....

    The post that I am quoting back actually opened with this:

&gt;   A grab bag of stuff from AATHP:
&gt;   First, we got Chris Williams' last post and Jeff Medkeff will
&gt;be replying to it via smail shortly. The draft of the letter
&gt;seems to indicate there will be lots of text getting Chris up
&gt;to date on the AATHP/LL events related to the Sinful Music
&gt;controversy, somewhat less text asking for clarification on
&gt;certain things that might be contradictory, and offering Chris a
&gt;courtesy subscription to Little Light.

     Chris has told someone we are in touch with that he has been
informed that AATHP will be providing evidence of the origin of our
con message. We would like to state that we made no such promise to
Chris, nor to anybody else who might pass it along to him. We don't
know who told Chris this, but it wasn't us.
     Chris' copy of Little Light was mailed today without the
promised letter.


                                  Jeff Tucker
                                  AATHP
