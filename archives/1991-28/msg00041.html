<PRE>

I recently got a catalogue from a firm in Glasgow who specialise in
promotional materials (posters, programmes etc). I initially passed the
information below on to Derek Langsford for posting in this group but he's
off at a conference at the moment and unable to send it, so I'll do it
myself.

Disclaimer1 : I have nothing to do with Push Posters. I'm only posting this
because Derek indicated that there might be a demand for this sort of stuff
in gaffa. I can't even claim to be a satisfied customer yet as I'm still
awaiting my own order. I normally wouldn't even include the ordering
information but I figured it'd be better to tag it on and save myself a lot
of hassle if anyone planned to order anything from them. This lists
contains all the information I have - if there's something confusing you,
don't ask me, because I don't know either :-)

Disclaimer2 : Also, I'm not much of a Kate fan, so I don't know *anything*
about the quality/content of the merchandise. I presume you people will
know what to expect a lot better than me.

Disclaimer 3 : This info is from their most recent catalogue (May '91) but
I'd still suggest that anyone planning to order stuff gives them a phone
call to check if they still have it. The address is...

Push Posters
PO Box 469
GLASGOW
G1 1TT
Scotland

Their phone number is 041-552-2424 [+44 41 552 2424 from outside the UK, I
think]. According to the catalogue this is a phone line from 11am until 6pm
(that's GMT, remember!!!) and there's a fax on the line at other times.

A couple of other things...before anyone asks, I can't order stuff from
this end and pass it on (avoiding all those nasty customs duties :-) -
sorry, but I don't have the cash or the time.

Sending them an SAE (IRC if you're outside the UK) will get you a copy of
their catalogue - they've got a pretty big selection and even some older
posters (I've ordered a John Foxx poster dating from 1983). Alternatively,
ask me and I can leaf through the catalogue and see if they've got anything
else that might interest you.

OK, here's what they list...

(# = pounds sterling)

Payment
-------

"Make out payments to Push Posters

Please write your name and address on the back of cheques/POs

UK : Pay be cheque, postal orders or cash (use registered mail for cash)

Overseas : Pay by IMO, Banker's Draft, Eurocheque (All must be drawn in UK
# Sterling) or UK # Sterling Cash (available from any bank)

Customers in the USA may also make payment in US Dollars by cash or money
order (please send cash if order is less than $30). Use the rate $2 = #1 to
cover our bank handling charges.

We can also accept payment by Visa/Access/Mastercard/Eurocard by either
phone or mail. If you wish to pay by this method enter card details on the
space provided on the order form or telephone/fax 041-552-2424 [that's +44
41 552 2424 from outside the UK - Al] quoting name on card, number, expiry
date."

Their despatch is supposedly within 48 hours for credit card and cash
orders and 8-10 days for cheque orders but they say to allow 28 days. I
noticed when I checked my balance this morning that the cheque I sent them
last Thursday has gone through so I'll be looking for my posters in the
post from tomorrow onwards.

Oh, and they will replace damaged goods if sent back within 10 days in the
original packaging.

Hope this info is of interest to someone out there.

ObKate: Anyone else in the UK notice that they're using "Running Up That
Hill" as the background music during the trailers for the athletics? Makes
a change from the inevitable "Gold" by Spandau Ballet I suppose ;-)
