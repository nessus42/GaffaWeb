1) It struck me th'otherday that Kate simply HAS TO ask the Trio Bulgarka
to join her on the Tour, so that the various TSW songs will get the
performances they deserve.

2) Has AAD vs AAA been debated to death on r.m.g?  Has Kate spoken about
this? (A quick search for the word 'digital' turns up nothing in Cbusting
part 3.)  All that talk about seeing god thru yr headphones reminded me
that I've never really put my KT cd's to the acid test, even though I spent
$80 on Sony MDV6's.  But they don't sound that great!  I have a fairly
shabby NEC player, and no amp, but the pre-amp has a volume control that
does okay for all but The Dreaming.  And when they're quiet songs, they
sound pretty good.  But TD is just mud at those volumes.  What should I buy
next, to fix this?  (Better acid???)

It got me wondering whether KT would not recommend vinyl over CD since she
uses analog for recording and editing.  (I have weird superstitious
suspicions about ESP and digital technology...)

All my most intimate Kate-experiences have been via a walkman and
in-the-ear head-plugs.  Lo-tech, with a vengeance.

Kate on analog ESP: "[Rolf Harris] picked up a dijeridu, placing one end of
it right next to my ear and the other at his lips, and began to play.
     "I've never experienced a sound quite like it before. It was like a
swarm of tiny velvet bees circling down the shaft of the dijeridu and
dancing around in my ear. It made me laugh, but there was something very
strange about it, something of an age a long, long time ago."

3) Dogged Love-Hounds will remember the intriguing reference Ed found to
Kate's never-published autobio, Leaving My Tracks.  As I was reading
Cloudbusting, I was struck by the vision that this IS that, as close as
we'll ever get.  I told Ron I thought we should change the name of the
text-only version of CB to "Leaving Her Tracks"!

4) Anyone know if Kate chose the arrangement of songs on TWW 1 and 2?

5) That mysterious Madame Maria Nanky, whose cover version of "Poor Old
Flea" Kate favors, gets a thank-you in the HoL acknowledgements.
