No one yet knows why PMANCHESTER@ccmail.sunysb.EDU (Peter Byrne Manchester) said:
&gt;&gt;  [About what TMBM would do after "JoL"]                "But I do 
&gt;&gt;have the drum track for 'Hounds of Love' already programmed."  So 
&gt;&gt;they did that song, with a trio of women as the vocalist, and the
&gt;&gt;whole crowd (which numbered about 25 then) joining in for the barks
&gt;&gt;and the chorus.  ...
&gt;
&gt;       Actually, this was more amazing still.  Jon said that he HAD made a 
&gt;drum track tape for HoL, but had accidentally erased it.  Everybody was hungry 
&gt;for the song, though.  So, in what was for me a particularly convincing 
&gt;display of heads-up command of his tools and real musicianship, he cobbled up 
&gt;a serviceable program on the spot in about 37 seconds.

Erm... much as I appreciate the kind words, I really ought to set the record
(no pun intended) straight on this point.  I think the confusion arose
because I was tapping out the rhythm to Running Up That Hill using my drum
pads and that led some people to (Ed?) think I had programmed it.  I *did*
already have Hounds Of Love pre-programmed, but if forced, I probably could
have re-created it in around 37 seconds.  It's only a two-bar riff.  The real
challenge is not the programming, but rather getting the proper amount of
wet/dry mix on the gated reverb.  You want the sounds to have the huge
WHACK, but not lose the attack of the original strike.

&gt;       Let the record show, by the way, that the craft and splendor of Jon-as-
&gt;Kate-as-Madonna's performance of "Wuthering Heights" was not lost upon 
&gt;elements of the crowd.  If IED has betimes been the love-hounds' numinous 
&gt;curmudgeon (Jorn Barger), Jon Drukman is its slamdancer.  He's a prodigy and a 
&gt;sweet lad.  Believe it.  Just don't bank on it.  Mr. Drukman can nail it down 
&gt;solid, and blow you away if you dance the fool.

Gawd, you're making me blush...  but what's this "Believe it, just don't
bank on it" stuff?  I don't get the reference.

Your official love-hounds slamdancer with katepunk attitude to spare...
