Greetings again,

Just a little note to let everyone know that I'm selling off some of
my doubles in my collection.  I have a lot of older LPs and 45's that
I am willing to part with, since I already have extras in a lot of
items.  I couldn't resist buying albums I found on the cheap,
regardless of how many I had!  So, I placed a list on my older web
site, feel free to check it out if you've got holes to fill in your
collection!  

<A  HREF="http://members.aol.com/leucophrys/music/forsale.htm">http://members.aol.com/leucophrys/music/forsale.htm</A>

All the stuff is in really good condition.  Plus I'm always willing to
trade for items I don't have.

But just FYI- here's a text list to start you off.  The web site has
more info.


Thanks, and I hope this helps some people find what they need...

Posters:
Smallish (around 24x36):
 The Lionheart tour- Babooshka picture
 The Sensual world- grains of sand
 Hounds of Love- cover poster
Large (40x60 subway)
 The sensual world- grains of sand (no text)
 The sensual world- holding a peach
 Love and Anger- small panel from video on huge black expanse
 This woman's work
 Rubberband girl
 hounds of love- dancing
 hounds of love- sitting on knees wearing a hat

All posters have spent most of their lives rolled in a protective tube
but have all been on a wall sometime in their past.  So there are
holes in corners, the occasional tape residue and the like.  BUT, they
all are devoid of any large wrinkles or tears and are in overall
really good condition, IMHO.  All large posters were bought by me near
the single release dates, so they are not reprints.

Most of my collection was acquired through Brass City Records in 
Waterbury, Connecticut from the kind owner, Walter.
