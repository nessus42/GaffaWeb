I've found Heather's lyrics sometimes one dimensional, but I'm absolutely
in love with her song sensibilty. That's why i brought it up. I think she's
an amazing musician who might ripen eventually into a major creative force
(she's still young, being at the lionheartish stage of her carreer). She's
spectacular live, and already has been given a fair amount of control over
how she wants to develop creatively.

BTW, the reason Walk This World was popular was definitely the sex angle
(something Heather doesn't shy away from), but she's (perhaps evasively)
stated that it had no real intention of being taken that way.
(Yeah, right)

Anyway, if anybody interested in good female vocals and solid song-writing
talent, Heather might deserve some investigating. I especially recommend
Live from the Milky Way.

just a few pennies in the fountain

&gt; &gt;Just a question about other music for you folks,
&gt; &gt;does anyone here remember Heather Nova?
&gt; &gt;how much exposure and what were your impressions.
&gt; &gt;I'll reserve my comment for the moment
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;BTW, not implying any sort of comparison to Kate, just curious.

&gt; Love Heather Nova, and I think she shines best when it's just her and
&gt; her acoustic guitar.  :)  Very poetic, rich voice, etc.  "My
&gt; Fidelity," "Truth and Bone," "Throwing Fire and Sun," "Island"  Just
&gt; wonderful!  Too bad the only airplay she ever got was "Walk This
&gt; World" which I don't think is really typical of her feats.  (Oh, I did
&gt; hear "Truth and Bone" played in a casino in Lake Tahoe last summer).
