Hi there Gaffites and Love-Hounds,
  Just reading part of the album covers thread and something was brought up
that I wanted to get your valued opinions on.
 Kate's always been attractive (she even made disco gear and clear plastic
somehow look good to me), but after going through my videos I can't help
but be amazed at how gracefully she's aged. No, she's not 'old'--that's not
what I'm saying. I'm saying that, especially in TLTCTC, she looks
FANTASTIC! I've seen too many female musicains hit a quite natural point
where you feel a little bit, I dunno, bad for them. Ann Wilson of Heart,
Janis Joplin (well okay, death doesn't help appearances), Stevie Nicks,
they all seem sort of sad to me watching the progression from really
intense performers to people that seem to have quite a bit of their spirits
knocked out of them. Don't even get me started on the males (Ozzy would
have a hard time NOT scaring people anymore--he doesn't need the make-up).
I'm bringing this up, not due to an obsession with beauty or youth, but
because I feel that it's quite possible that Kate could easily become a
greater inspiration in the future than she is now.
  One thing is her dancing. 20 years from now, I can easily imagine the
Beavis and Butthead descendants watching a Kate video and saying "Whoa, did
you see what she just did?"  Face it, Rubberband Girl would be pretty
impressive for a 20 year old performer (well at least outside of proper
dance companies). Her voice seems to get better as well, moving away from
the nearly opaque layers of the Dreaming to what is now nothing less than a
force of nature. (who got the most voice-based clip in Let It Be?)
  Anyway, my opinion is that Kate PROVES that a few lines setting on your
face can be worn well and needn't be the end of devout admiration. With
Kate though, I don't think it was ever really skin deep to begin with.
