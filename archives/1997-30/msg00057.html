	&gt;My favorite cover is the Moments of Pleasure single (UK
release)........  
	&gt;........there's something about not only the use of the vivid
colors on the
	&gt;cover--stopping just shy of being boldly garish, yet somehow
maintaining a
	&gt;beauty and spirited brilliance--but also how it captures Kate's
	vivaciousness
	&gt;as she dances over the skulls and bones of the people in the
blazing
	&gt;fire...not to mention the look on her face and how she appears
to be
	&gt;rejoicing the moment.  I know we've all seen it before in
TLTC&amp;TC, but they
	&gt;picked the *perfect* clip for the cover!

	I always thought the cover for this CD was rather odd
considering the subject
	of the song.  We have a song about several real people who have
died in the
	last few years, and a picture of Kate,  with a big grin on her
face, dancing
	on
	a pile of bones.

	Is this just me?

	Simon

No, I agree.  I would thought that a still from the actual sequence in
TLTCTC where Kate sings "Moments of Pleasure" would be a little more
appropriate than this one, a great picture though it is.  It seemed an
odd choice and, assuming that it was Kate's choice, one wonders what the
rationale was.  It has the feel, to me, of being packaged by someone
else not entirely involved in the music.  

Thinking about it, the cover of "And So Is Love" would have matched the
mood of "Moments" more.  I know this topic has been covered before by
love hounds but most of the single choices from TRS were disappointing,
not because I don't like and appreciate the songs in themselves but I
felt there were stronger, more commercial (eek! perish the thought)
tracks to use.  Confining the single release from those tracks used in
TLTCTC was perhaps a logical enough decision in terms of supporting the
film &amp; video release, but I believe that the album, in its own context,
could have been better represented.  I say this wishing, as a fan, that
her music could reach more people.  'Cause it's brilliant.
