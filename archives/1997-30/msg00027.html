&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Usually reliable sources have described Kate's leaving school as
&gt; &gt;"dropping out".
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does this render Kate vulnerable to being labeled an "airhead"?
&gt; 
&gt; If we dug around, we would probably find some equivalents
&gt; from the late seventies.  Her quotes of the time seemed
&gt; deliberately aimed at promoting the 'vapid sex kitten'
&gt; image.  As I recall, she detested it, but before the
&gt; days of the Internet, I and a friend of mine had to
&gt; work like hell to get enough interview material and
&gt; other resources to figure out exactly where Kate
&gt; was coming from.  So, it isn't hard to get a rep as
&gt; an airhead in the media of that day, or any day.  I know
&gt; people in the business who went straight from the
&gt; 'vapid sex kitten' to 'strange weird witch' without
&gt; skipping to consider the quality of the construction of
&gt; Kate's music, the scope of the content of her lyrics,
&gt; the perfection of her recording technique, the emotional
&gt; depth of her performance... in other words, the
&gt; f**king brilliance of her work.  They saw what they
&gt; wanted to see or what they COULD see, and they believed it,
&gt; and they repeated it.
&gt; 
&gt; It takes a long time and a lot of effort for
&gt; "mere mitra" to become "mere dost".  One has to work
&gt; at it.  I'm glad I had a friend to help me, (lost her),
&gt; and I'm glad I could see what was behind the hype.
&gt; I'm just glad I found Kate.  She gave me courage.
&gt; How rare, how wonderful, and how weird she really is.
&gt; If folks need to compare others to her, let them,
&gt; because she is incomparable.

============================================
You know, I don't know if this will come across the way I want, but the
more familiar I become with Kate as a person, the more I think I think I
respect her, not for what she is, but for what she isn't. And when it
comes to intellectual matters, she comes across as intelligence but not
*excessively* sophisticated. Just as people can build up big muscles and
have poor agility ("muscle-bound"), I've seen people who were so
educated that they couldn't even realize how much bullshit they had in
their heads. Or to put it another way--some people's heads could *use* a
little airing out :-) We probably all know someone fitting that
description.
