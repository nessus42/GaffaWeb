KT News (coupled with some general aimless complaining):
^^^^^^^^

Well, Allan and Maura of Intergalactic Garage have put out
a new KaTalogue update, and it's very tempting. First of all,
they are offering NTSC VHS factory-sealed copies of The Whole
Story for $29.95 post paid, if ordered by April 22. Seeing as
how no-one in L.A. has even heard of a release date for this
tape yet, it seems like a pretty good deal. Too bad there's
no Beta offer, though. They also have the soundtrack to
Castaway, the Nicholas Roeg movie featuring a brand new Kate
Bush track, "Be Kind to My Mistakes", for $11.99 plus $2.00 postage.
Again, this isn't even available yet out here, because the
damn retailers never really make specific requests for new
imports, they just wait around for the distributors to decide,
and then they take whatever they're offered. The whole import business
is enough to make you sick, you know? Why in God's name should
someone have to wait more than eight weeks (who knows how much more)
to receive a record, video-tape or laser-disk from Japan? If people
did their jobs properly, it could be placed, filled and delivered
to the customer's door inside of one week. and the Japanese import
distributors speak Japanese, too -- haven't they ever heard of long
distance???

Now, the mail-bag:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

&gt;By the way, should we record some kind of a tone or something
&gt;between each person's set of tracks to make things easier to distinguish/find?
&gt;
&gt;-- Mark Kat(e)souros

Good idea, Mark! Each person leave ten seconds blank between their track
and the one directly preceding it, and in the meantime let's have some
Love-Hounds Jingles to put in between them. "Here's -- Paul -- Shaffer!"

&gt;Incidently,
&gt;Andy, I found your selections quite
&gt;interesting but, because each segment was so brief, had a hard time
&gt;getting a really good taste of anything.  I propose we try to keep the
&gt;segments perhaps as long as a minute.  Anyway, I'm off to record ten or so
&gt;minutes of my most recommended music.  (This may not be my favourite music
&gt;though.

By all means, make the samples as long or as brief as you wish.
No-one has to edit anything down at all if they don't want.
IED didn't intend for his segment to serve as a model for anyone else's
-- it's much too uninviting to serve very well as a paragon of teasers.
It's severely edited by personal choice, not particularly in order to
win new listeners. Although he more or less likes the pieces on his
track, he specifically tried to present them in a non-advertising
way. To him personally, presenting a smaller selection of tracks with
a longer playing time for each track would have placed too much
importance on those pieces. He doesn't place too much importance on
anything except Kate, and maybe Scriabin -- and no-one would have
wanted a whole eleven minutes of Scriabin! So the natural alternative
was to have fun with editing and try to put as much stuff by the
listener as possible within the time alotted. Besides, in IED's
opinion, any piece can be reduced to a few seconds of "core"
material, a single passage that sums up the identity of the entire
track. He doesn't think too much has been lost from any of those
pieces, providing people are interested enough to listen hard --
not that anyone is urged to do so.
