should be out (if it isn't already).  It's called Headache and is an EP.
Advance reports said the cover would be a photo of a ax-murder victim
taken from the Cook County Morgue and the back would be the same victim
with his brain taken out for display.  There will supposedly be TWO
issues of the same record.  One will be the economy version with just
liner notes similar to previous records - the other issue will have 
such stuff as photos, a bottle opener and "lots of suprises" AND a
bonus 7", the contents unknown but it might be the same stuff they
recently donated to The Peel Sessions (uyeah - but I don't know when
THAT will be out) or it might be the stuff on God's Favorite Dog.  The
expensive issue will come in a naugehyde bag.  After the EP is released,
a single called "Heartache" , a cover of a Wire song will be issued.  Then,
the swansong, "Songs For Fucking" (or songs about fucking) will be
released as an LP in late summer.  Big Black will then break up in 
September (but still play limited gigs in or around Chicago) as
Dave Riley will be going to law school.  Other gossip:  Albini has
been banned for life from the Metro in Chicago, a big nightspot/club
for the nasty stuff he's written about  them.  During the tour in 
Europe they played with Killing Joke and called them "dinks".  Albini
said three years ago, he looked upon them as "children on acid" - now
he says they don't do acid anymore.


(Speaking of Chicago - Ian MacKaye will be releasing a solo album on 
a Chicago label which will supposedly be a collaboration with 
Iian Bourgess (sic?) of Ministry !?!?!?!)
