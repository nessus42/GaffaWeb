Various items...

Boy Dirt Car was supposed to start on a West Coast tour a few weeks ago
I tried to get tour dates but my letter probably didn't get to Eric Lunde
on time. Oh well...

There are rumors that Cause and Effect, the Indianapolis-based mail order
thingie for extreme music (Viscera, Blackhouse, John Duncan, Merzbow,
Human Flesh etc.) is calling it quits. Does anyone know?

IDF stands for "I Died Fucking". They have a new ep out and a new album
will be out in the fall. New video coming in June. Great slabs of noise
industrial stuff, but done mostly with guitars and real instruments
and heavily processed.

When Hogge and I were up at the radio station last night, we cued up
the new Current 93 album and took a power reading. What was the current
reading? 93. If we get kidnapped by black leathery faceless things from
a smoking pit in the ground, you'll know why.

Mistake in Option review section (again): the cassette Clubcrack by Slip
should really be Slip by Club Crack. Dark and raw danceable post-punk
with good synth effects and sheet metal percussion. 

Other good Chambana bands which should eventually make their way to the
review sections: the Shakes (excellent tight demented big guitar post-punk
that thrash in weird meters;  if you like wild guitar in 11/8 or 7/8
time this will more than satisfy you. New tape soon.), Tugrik Dhughugrik
(lighter post-punk with good songs and searing guitar solos), Generic
Error (these guys are beginning to sound like Urge Overkill when they're
good; more power to them; great thick guitar/bass noise), Mr. Rogers
Neighbors (monster funk 4-piece, noisy and thrashy, great live performers).
Also Still Warm Stillborn (acoustic industrial performance group; we'll
see if Dom ever gets interested in taping one of these shows) and
Blood Brain Barrier (improv/noise/jazz; rumors that they're breaking up
but they've always been a fragmented group).

Bill
