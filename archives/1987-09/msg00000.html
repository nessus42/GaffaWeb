<PRE>
Having vowed to buy no records/CDs this term (thus making me feel better about
shelling out the $220 for a synth), I haven't much new news to report.
I have, however, just borrowed some early Sonic Youth ("Sonic Youth", "Confu-
sion is Sex", "Kill Yr. Idols") and a live double from '85, which I eagerly
anticipate abrading my eardrums to.

How much do these CD singles cost?  I'm used to shelling out $5 for a 12", but
I dunno how much more I'd pay for one of these jobs.

I am interested in joining this tape projeKT.  What kind of stuff should I add
that won't already be on it and won't be too familiar to most of the people
involved?  Cocteau Twins and Sonic Youth come to mind as they seem to be my
major obsessions.  Could also add Hula, Savage Republic, Harold Budd ... or
even stuff like XTC / Dukes of Stratosphear, Woodentops, Killing Joke if
people somehow have evaded being exposed to them (not likely I guess).
Suggestions?  And what's already going on the tape?  (Guess I'll find out
when/if I get it...)

Rumor I hear from my S.Y.lender is that they should have a new album out soon.
Anyone hear about this?  Any prospect of a tour anytime?  True to form, I
discovered them (MANY thanks to all the love-hounds who kept repeating how
great they are!) soon after they played L.A.  Grrr.

So what's been released recently that I should spend my bux on come June?
(Older stuff I wanna get: Hitchcock "Groovy {Decay,Decoy}", Cult "Love")
