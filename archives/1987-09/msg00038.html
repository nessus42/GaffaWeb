&gt;&gt;The new Kate Bush song from "She's Having A Baby" is entitled
&gt;&gt;"Make It Go Away".

&gt;O.K., Sue, your mysterious KT-fan friend told you this, right? So, what
&gt;did the song sound like? Is there any info on the film yet?
&gt;Any mention of Kate's involvement in print yet? Is the song about
&gt;the movie, or completely independent? And why doesn't the KBC ever
&gt;tell us about these things first???

1) Yes.
2) He compared it to "Under the Ivy."
3) Yes. Like I said, it's a John Hughes production, and it stars
   Elizabeth McGovern as a yuppie who's (quelle surprise) having
   a baby.
4) Not that I know of. Remember, this person saw a rough cut of
   the film *more than two months prior to its release date*
   which means that many changes may yet be made. Which means that
   Kate's dulcet tones may be replaced by Stacey Q's. Urgh.
5) He said that the song fit the action of the accompanying scene
   very well. (It was not played over the credits as originally
   reported -- my mistake)
6) Maybe it's a big secret! Maybe the song WON'T BE IN THE FILM
   AFTER ALL and IED will die a horrible, gruesome death! Aiee!

And speaking of the silver screen, my filmbiz friend told me about
an exciting new movie called "Million Dollar Mystery," hitting the
cinemas this summer. A Glad trash bag containing a million smackers
is hidden somewhere in America. Clues to the bag's location are
in the film. By seeing it repeatedly, it should become clear where
the cash is located! Then you can go dig it up!
But the best part is, the film was actually sponsored by Glad and it
stars -- who else -- Tom Bosley!!! Sounds like an Oscar contender to me.

&gt;Well, Allan and Maura of Intergalactic Garage have put out
&gt;a new KaTalogue update, and it's very tempting. First of all,
&gt;they are offering NTSC VHS factory-sealed copies of The Whole
&gt;Story for $29.95 post paid, if ordered by April 22.

What about we laggards who didn't happen across this note until
20 April, who don't have the address or phone # or I.G. (yeah,
I know it's been posted, but...) How much will it cost after
22 April?

A final note. Buy the Neats' "Crash at Crush" on Coyote Records.
Not quite as transcendent as their primal Ace of Hearts/Propellor
stuff, when the Neats were garage band gods, but it's still v. nifty
and after being forced to listen to Fleetwood Mac's "Tango in the
Night" fourteen times in a row it is brilliance personified, even if
Eric Martin's voice *is* gruffer than Stevie Nicks'. Now, if only
some helpful Bostonian could tell me whatever became of Jerry Channell,
the Neats' onetime organist...
