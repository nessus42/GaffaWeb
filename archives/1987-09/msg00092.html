I don't know about any of the rest of you, but I got my _Whole_Story_
videotape today (27 April).  It was originally to have been released
on 15 April, but it arrived this morning.

So, here's the poop.  The tape's contents are identical to that of the
album/CD (12 songs) PLUS _The_Big_Sky_ tagged onto the end as a thirteenth
video.  The tape is released by Sony (EMI no longer has a video branch--
at least, not one called EMI).  I think the reason that Sony got this one
is that Sony usually releases Picture Music International's stuff, and
half of the videos are listed as "A Picture Music International Production".

Now for my questions:
1)  The video for "Wow" is a montage of slo-mo footage from the Hammersmith
	concert.  Is this the video that was originally used with the
	release of the song?  Or did they whip this up for this particular
	tape?

2)  Is it just my imagination, or did someone remix "The Big Sky"
	(not lengthen, just soften some sounds and accent others)
	for the video?

3)  Why didn't they just go ahead and release ALL of Kate's videos on
	this tape (i.e., combine "The Single File" with "Hair Of the
	Hound", since neither tape has had an American release)?

Also, a note of hope for Beta owners out there--I got _The_Whole_
Story_ on Beta (Hi-Fi).  If Intergalactic Garage doesn't carry it,
pressure them into ordering it, because I can assure you that it
exists.

(P.S., Does anyone have a good source for the import 12" single of
"Cloudbusting"?  I've worn out two of them, and I can't find it anymore.
Also, why hasn't anyone considered releasing a CD of Kate's B-sides,
or of adding them onto the CD releases of her albums? I hate the fact
that I can't hear "My Lagan Love" without also listening to lots of
pops and crackles.)
