Re: Big Black and the Metro

I assume it's the Cabaret Metro... I haven't been there for shows but
my impression is they book lots of trendy groups and the occasional
underground act. Hogge saw Einsturzende Neubauten there. IDF played
there earlier this month, complete with videos, so I guess the Metro
can't be all bad...

All you lucky folks on the east coast can catch Scratch Acid in a
few weeks. They'll be in Cincinatti in the next few days but Yow
(lead singer) was pretty flaky about exactly where and when they'll
play, so... he mumbled Boston, Philly, Baltimore etc. Tell them their
Champaign/Urbana fans sent you.

And where were they before heading out to the east coast? Here, of course.
Bomb, mystery band from San Francisco, opened, but I missed them.
These guys supposedly got kicked out of Barrington in Berkeley, so
they're probably worth seeing. And of course you have to see Scratch
Acid. Yow made a few bad jokes near the beginning (hey this is a liberal
audience) but stuck to singing after he got no response. The band
played a good noisy set, but they kind of stood there saving the 
theatrics for Yow. You can't hear the lyrics, but as compensation
you get to see Yow avoid slamdancers, take his shirt off, sing while
holding the top of his jeans, take a boot off, stick it on the microphone
stand, jump around, stick his fingers in his crotch, etc. They did
most of the good material from the three ep/lps (Owner's Lament
works even without the organ, She Said, El Espectro etc). Fairly
short set (40-45 mins?) but the band was friendly enough after the
show.
