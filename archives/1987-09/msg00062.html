I don't know what it is with the Iron Horse and humorous acts, or is
it just that those are the only ones I hear about.  Uncle Bonsai consists
of two women and guy whose voice is so high that he might as well be
a woman.  They sing songs of despair over the news that "The Love Boat"
was cancelled, or songs about penis envy, or songs about writing songs
("You just take an E chord, and then play a B Chord...").  They are usually
very witty, and are very polished performers.  The one beef I had with the
show was the constant problems with the sound system, although that was
obviously beyond their control.  At least they got a few good jokes out
of it.  Typical sound problem interlude:  an audience member asked Arni
if they had played at some club in Washington, to which the band replied
that it was an avant garde club and that they weren't avant enough for it.
While the soundman fiddled with his knobs, Arni drily commented: "Yeah,
they do stuff like this, only on purpose..."
Anyway, if they ever stop through your town, I highly recommend that
you go see them, since they are extremely amusing and damn good at what they
do.
