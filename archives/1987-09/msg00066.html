For the record, IED has been thinking about that
vicious review of the Ferry Aid single which he
posted in L-Hs a couple of weeks ago, and he has
decided that it was really over the top. Whether it
was written in the belief that it bore no relation
to the disaster itself or not, there's no denying
that it had the effect of ridiculing the whole event,
not just the artistic result. For that he apologizes.

&gt;Subject: Yeah, you guys with the tape
&gt;better watch it or Tim is gonna put the new A-Ha and AlphaVille
&gt;stuff on there.  So STRAIGHTEN UP AND WALK STRAIGHT, IED, THE
&gt;LORD IS WATCHING YOUR EVERY MOVE WAITING TO SQUASH YOU IF "YOU"
&gt;DONT TALK AND THINK LIKE A WHITE HETEROSEXUAL DRUNK MAN!!!!!!#$@#$@#^%
&gt;
&gt;-- Hofboy

IED studied the above for some time before deciding
that he just didn't understand it. What are you talking about, Hofboy?
Is it an attempt to solicit information about IED's sexual
proclivities? Believe him, you don't want to know. "...there are
some secrets too dark to let out...to let go of...to get over."
If Tim wants to put a-ha and Alphaville on the tape, by all means let him
do so. Anyway, IED liked "Big in Japan", sort of. He didn't even mind
"Take on Me" -- as long as it stayed on AM and TV.

&gt;Subject: tape mailing list
&gt;I suspect that out site has been missing some love-hounds mail.  How
&gt;exactly is this compilation tape mailing list going to work?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;--John

&gt;If it's not too late please add me to the LH tape compilation list :
&gt;Thanx.
&gt;
&gt;PS - I assume everyone is using Dolby B?
&gt;
&gt;-- Tom R. Loden

To answer the continuing questions, the Love-Hounds KompilaTion
tape is an ongoing project to help disseminate various members'
taste in music. Each contributor is asked to record no more than
twelve minutes of music (unless he/she wants to add another tape
to the package, in which case he/she can put down as much as
desired), and then send it on to the next L-H on the list.
So, John, if you want to receive it, better send IED or L-Hs your
address. (That goes for Walter Henry, too.) With any luck you'll receive
it by December '92 at the latest. And no, Tom, you can't count on
Dolby B. People will use whatever NR they've got, which may be none.
This tape is no hi-fi product.
