Some responses:

Pete Shelley was the lead singer for the Buzzcocks. He and fellow
Buzzcock wrote some of the greatest songs to come out of the late
'70s punk scene. His solo stuff is fairly different from the 
Buzzcocks tho.

New Order is the wimped-out remnants of Joy Division.

Well Tom Dube, I think Roger Miller writes GOOD songs. And his singing
is NOT annoying. And speaking of Roger Miller...

Birdsongs of the Mesozoic at Champaign IL

Less than 50 in attendance, probably because of the fact that some
assholes were turning people away when it wasn't sold out. Also the
trendies flocked to the Plasmatics concert down the street. Birdsongs
were godlike, what can I say?

Except this is what you get live that you don't get on their vinyl:
1) much more rhythm and layering of taped and live percussion. The
   long percussion jam in the middle of Beat of the Mesozoic was
   awesome.
2) the minimalist figurations that give the pieces structure are downplayed,
   and the neat noisy stuff is mixed way up. You really HEAR the
   noisy braying guitar, the birdcalls (pterodactyl calls?), Martin
   Swope's tape effects, Roger Miller's tone clusters and piano effects
   etc. 

They did all the best material from their vinyl, like Rocky/Bullwinkle,
Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, Tyger, Shiny Golden Snakes, Beat of the
Mesozoic etc. Also this great unrecorded song with "revolution" in
the title which sounded like dying dinosaurs and had people dancing
like dying dinosaurs.

Catch them when they come into your area (they're heading east). You'll
never want to listen to Philip Glass again.

Interesting observation: many of the bands passing thru are not playing
New York City. People who've played here in the past three weeks: 
Snakefinger and the Vestal Virgins, Flaming Lips, Scratch Acid, Mojo
Nixon, Birdsongs. Big Black will be here in a few days.
