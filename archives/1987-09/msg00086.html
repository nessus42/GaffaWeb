"He shook my hand...  ed fROMOHIO shook my hand.."
"Well, I know someone who slept with him once...  And one of my
 best friends was going out with George for a while..."

fIREHOSE / Saqqara Dogs / DC3 @ I-Beam, SF, April 20

I have since washed it.  /jordan, you met her...

DC3 - hmm, *palatable* meat-and-potatoes rock.  Quite accomplished,
but not suffocatingly slick.  A band to have gone out of your way
to see in the mid-70s.

Saqqara Dogs were also accomplished, with their distinctive vaguely
Mideastern sound, amped by the bas-relief, Giza, Abu Simbel slide show
projected onto them.  I couldn't figure out how the dude on dumbek was
making some of the noises some times - it looked like he was pulling
at the skin.

fIREHOSE, what a joyful sound.  I got more of a rush from their first
few songs than I did from those renowned Time cover-avatars of ecstasy
last night.  (With primely-located random-selected seats and everything.)
The way Ed throws himself into each song, his baby-face almost unbelieving
where he is and what he's doing.  Mike the proud papa grinning at the edge
of the stage.  George with a full 90% of his hair well past his head.
That little guitar solo in the middle (George on sax) seemed pretty
pointless though - only-an-album-of-material syndrome?  Cover of (as I
was told later) Blue Oyster Cult's "The Red and the Black" for encore.

House social directors Nils and Gene, also members of our house band
Acid Rain (metal piss-takers with Zappa and Frith influences thrown in,
a sample lyric is "Heathens rise and defend macho absurdity", Berkeleyans
look for them on Lower Sproul Monday at noon) managed to
get backstage to talk to Mike about doing a show at Barrington (and by
the way where did you hear that bullshit story Bill?).  Contacting the
management (Dukowski) down south, they're doing a big SST show in Huntington
Beach our next Wine Dinner unfortunately, but y'all look for them to come up
some time next fall.

As for U2 (if you even care), humble and self-effacing, but very predictable.
No covers (no "Maggie's Farm", dammit), no B-sides.  Was Bono sick or
something?  The sound sucked too.  A little heroin spiel, a little Amnesty
International spiel, bringing a girl up on stage to hug and dance with...
I guess they don't really have to prove themselves anymore.
"Exit" was excellent though, and the little snippet of
"Love Will Tear Us Apart" took me by surprise...
