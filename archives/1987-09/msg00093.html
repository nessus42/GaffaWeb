&gt; 
&gt; Neil -- IED sincerely apologizes for the omission of your
&gt; name from the list. You definitely will get the tape, but
&gt; probably after most of the U.S. contributors have put their
&gt; parts on. Then we'll send it to England and Scotland. What
&gt; about the Australian Love-Hounds? Aren't you interested?

To Up-over Love-Hounds from a Down Under Love-Hound
 
Hi,

I'd love to be included in the mailing list for the compilation tape(s), so 
I can include some of our "gnarly" OZ groups. Can you please tell me what sort
of music you would like me to place on the tape .... or is that up to my own
discretion. Do you want only independent or undercover bands, popular (top 40)
groups i.e. INXS, Jimmy Barnes, Hoodoo Gurus etc., or a mixture of both? Also,
can you give me an idea of how long you wish me to make this end of the tape?

Went and saw the Hoodoo Gurus on Friday the 24 April at a place called 
"The Venue", in Melbourne. Disappointed by boys' playing .. very loose, 
possibly due to the fact that the bass was up to loud and they had early flight
7am, into Melbourne. Nothing like they played last January 1986 for their 
Like wow Wipeout tour - that was a memorable gig.

A friend went and saw the Gurus on the next night (Saturday the 25 April) and
they apologised to any members of the crowd who had seen them last night for 
the shoddy performance. So at least they were aware they  played terribly.

Look forward for the tape .. if you'll let me have it.


P.S. Can some-one tell me why we're called Love-Hounds and why every-one issues
     DISCLAIMERS?


I going to follow the rest of the crowd and issue the usual DISCLAIMER anyway! 


My snail mail address for the tape is:

    Paul Whiting
    Dept of Communication &amp; Electronic Engineering,
    Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology,
    124 Latrobe St, Melbourne, 3000, Australia
