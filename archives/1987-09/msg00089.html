There has been a rash of good and potentially good concerts around
here lately.  Here are some raves and pans you might consider before
seeing these acts when they come around.  I'll work backwards
chronologically.

Last night, Tom Verlaine played at the Ritz.  I would have expected
more enthusiasm for his first return to his old neighborhood in 2
years.  I found the show pretty boring, and I'm a big fan.  Some of
the songs were good, but his guitar work seemed stale. This is a big
problem, since much of the show consists of endless guitar doodling.
He ended the set (before the encores) with ten minutes of scraping
his strings whilst twisting the volume knob on his amp.  Yawn.

The highlights of the show were the two encores.  "Marquee Moon" was
played "straight", without any extended leads.  Then, he finished up
with a rave-up number I've never heard before.  This wasn't quite
enough to make the show worthwhile, and I could only recommend his show
to those who already admire his work. 

The night before, the Celibate Rifles were in town (CBGB).  This was a great
show, not to be missed by any fans of garage rock or 70's punk.
Incredible amount of energy.  I think the guitarist might do well in
a fast-strum-contest against Johnny Ramone. Oh, and the drums!  The
drums were miked so loud that every snare beat caused waves of pain.
I loved it.  The highlight of the show was a version of "Thank You,
America".  The live version is completely different from the song
as it appears on "Mina Mina Mina".  The spoken overdubs are cleared
away to allow the band plenty of space for a "Sister Ray" style jam.

Dig Dipper were among the bands on the undercard for Celibate Rifles.
They're a nice fun Replacements-like band.  I don't know anything
about them other than the fact that they traveled through last time
with the Volcano Suns.  If Big Dipper is playing in your local club,
I'd recommend the trip.

Going back to last Tuesday, I saw B.A.D. at Irving Plaza. They would
be much better if the songs would just end sooner.  I've always had
the same complaint about Nick Cave.  Every song sounds good for the
first two minutes, and then they go on and on. It seems everyone
is having success with Prince songs these days, but B.A.D.'s version
of "1999" just fell flat.

The highlight of the B.A.D. show was the opening band, Vernon Reid's
Living Color.  A black band that sings political lyrics to Deep Purple
guitar licks will always get my attention.  Besides, Vernon Reid is
one hell of a guitarist.  

Last weekend, John Cale AND BAND played the concert of the year.
I have to emphasize the "AND BAND", because in the past his touring
bands have been weak.  For the last two years Cale has been touring
alone, or as a duet with Chris Spedding, and this arrangement seemed
much preferable to his bands of the past.  But now, he seems to have
put it all together. Chris Spedding remains on guitar, and is so good
that he threatens to steal the show.  I don't know the two musicians
who compose the rhythm section, but they're amazingly powerful and
precise.  Four great musicians playing from the catalog of one of
rock's best songwriters.  It has to be good, but they take it much
further.  A show not to be missed.

Finally, I'd like to get in a plug for Boston's The Zulus.  I was
a H.S.R. fan, but when the Zulus' debut EP appeared last year, I found
it pretty boring.  Well, I just saw them live for the first time, and
live they still are one great band.  The funny thing is that the songs
from the EP sound wonderful live. I don't know where the recording
went wrong, but this band has a lot of potential.

When I saw the Zulus, they were opening for Roger Miller.  His
playing is sometimes interesting, although hardly innovative.
His vocals are annoying (not in a good way), and the song writing
awful.  Being at the mercy of a tape loop does not excuse his insipid
lyrics.  Oh well, I guess it's just not for my taste.
                                  - Tom Dube
