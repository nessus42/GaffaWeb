Well, this one was short, and I had a bit of time left, so I'm already ready
with it. It doesn't say ANYTHING, has serious spelling errors in the discography,
but it is POSITIVE. Remember that Max probably won't say anything negative about
anyone, since it's that kind of a magazine. Don't Worry, Be Happy...

Bye,

Uli

Article from 'Max, November - 11/93'

One page. Two pictures out of the (first) Rubberband Girl video (Kate in the
straight jacket and Kate on the trampolin) as well as a picture with Kate
wearing a head. This is the same picture that was used in the me/sounds
interview in their 11/93 issue.

KATE BUSH

She belongs to the British music scene like sticky cakes to the five o'clock
tea. Since Kate Bush took the international charts by storm in 1978 with
"Wuthering Heights" the anglo-saxon music scene is enriched by a top act that
has to be taken seriously. The actual album "The Red Shoes" (EMI) is the
seventh go from the now 35 years old exeptional vocalist.

Her carriere begins so perfect, as you almost can't imagine in any other way:
With sweet sixteen Kate Bush, daughter of an Irish woman and a country doctor
from Plumstead, is discovered and supported in person by Pink Floyds guitar
mastermind David Gilmour. He managed to get a paradisical contract with the
major label EMI for the young piano talent: three years long she is allowed to
study dance and singing on the expense of the record label, before the studio
date for the furious debut "The Kick Inside" was due. The exceptionally high
pitched voice got the trademark of the shy teenager. With longing love ballads
and melancolic-subtle harmonies she gradually conquers a growing body of fans
who understandably demand stage presence. 1979 Kate Bush goes for the first and
only time in her carreer on tour. "I am not a concert person. This might be
because I've never sung in a live band, but rather was sitting at home alone at
the piano and was allowed to compose to myself", she explains her aversion
against public display of her art, "at some point in 1979 I had the feeling
that I had given away too much from myself." In multi yearlong pauses between
each new album Kate Bush pulls back herself completely and at most emerges
again for benefiz projects or for a duet with her friend and colleague Peter
Gabriel ("Don't Give Up"). "I don't want to submit to what people want to see
in me. Therefore I always develop different personalities - especially in
videos. For not being nailed down to an image by appearances."

With a downright exorbitant way Ms Bush understands to create always new
pictures of herself: from the childish-naive fairy to the erotic-mysterious
femme fatale.

But even when it doesn't seem so the 164 cemtimeter tall woman with the long
henna locks isn't so dreadfully mysterious: "Sometimes I think that people who
see me think: 'Oh God, doesn't she look small and old?', but I know, that noone
would say this to me straight into the face."
