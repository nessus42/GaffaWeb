I don't like to follow-up myself, but this time I have to:

Vox has yet another version of that Chrissie Iley interview, but if you start
comparing the Vox and the musikexpress/sounds version, you find something
very interesting:

It definitively IS the same interview. Too many parallels. But then there are
QUITE A LOT of major differences. I truly begin to understand that Kate has
a cassette recorder by herself when she's interviewed. These interviews show
how seriously bad editors of interviews can work. Omitting some questions isn't
what I mean - you often have to struggle for space - but changing the whole
structure, asking different questions, rearranging the answers, that should
be a real no-no.

All this is not due to the pure process of translating from English into German.
You could do a much better job if this was the problem. This is more like
translating the interview from English first to Finnish, then to Sanskrit, then
to Japanese, then to Suaheli and then maybe back into German. And not a single
time by native speakers of any of the involved languages.

ARGH!!!

You'll understand this when I've translated the German version back into English
and when you put the Vox and the me/sounds interview side by side.

Why? Why do they do this? It isn't strictly neccessary. Yes, of course you should
remove 'ugh's or 'aahhh..'s, but this is much much more.

Be assured that the transcription of the MTV Most Wanted phone interview I gave
1 1/2 weeks ago was done as faithful as I could do it. I couldn't make out
all words, but I marked them. The only way this couldn't be a real interview
would be MTV faking it. Phoning her up earlier and editing the audio tape.
I hope they won't do this. But since this interview was very chaotic at times
I think it's autentical.

Bye,

Uli
