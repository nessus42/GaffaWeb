1.   General

1.1. What is rec.music.gaffa?

     Rec.music.gaffa is an 8-year-old newsgroup dedicated to the sublime,
     peerless artistic genius of Kate Bush, and to her fans, and many other
     "progressive" artists. "Gaffa" comes from her song "Suspended in
     Gaffa" (on "The Dreaming"), and (at least according to Kate) refers
     to gaffer's tape, or duct tape, used to keep people from tripping over
     electrical cabling, and metaphorically, apparently, to a frustrating
     sort of limbo-dimension ("the idea of seeing something incredibly
     beautiful, having a religious experience... but not being able to
     get back there"):

        "Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
         It all goes slo-mo
         I don't know why I'm crying
         Am I suspended In Gaffa?"

1.2. What is Love-Hounds?

     Submissions to rec.music.gaffa are forwarded to an extensive mailing
     list of people without usenet access. This means that anyone with the
     ability to send and receive mail can take part. The mailing list was
     r.m.g's original format, when started by |&gt;oug /\lan so many years ago.
     Together, the mailing list and r.m.g. form an informal fan club called
     "Love-Hounds." You can mail submissions, without fear of censorship, to:

        love-hounds@uunet.UU.NET

     Especially rabid 'Hounds subscribe to the list *as well as* reading
     r.m.g., because glitches can cause you to miss messages [hopefully
     fixed with the new system]. To subscribe to the mailing list, send a
     friendly message to the "moderator", Bill Wisner (who's actually in
     California), via:

        love-hounds-request@uunet.UU.NET

     It is possible to subscribe via various other email services: America
     OnLine, Compuserve, MCI-Mail, FidoNet, SprintMail, GENIE, Peacenet,
     Bix, Envoy-100, Connect, and others. For example, Compuserve users can
     use the above addresses with "&gt;INTERNET:" in front of them. Right now,
     Prodigy is not gatewayed to Usenet, as far as we know. Love-Hound
     Richard Caldwell offers access for the price of your long-distance call
     via the Big Sky BBS, 24 hours a day at 614-864-1198 (1200 or 2400
     baud). Another Kate-related BBS is The Electronic Cafe at
     1-805-399-3636. A Kate-related BBS in Canada called Night Scented
     Stock, run by the former editor of the fanzine Still Breathing. It's
     unfortunately not connected to love-hounds, but may soon be.
     1-604-572-4733.

1.3. How are they connected?

     To ensure that every message from the newsgroup rec.music.gaffa also
     finds its way into the mailing list love-hounds, rec.music.gaffa is
     a moderated newsgroup. This means that to post an article to r.m.g
     you have to send it as an email message to the moderator who has to
     approve the article. In r.m.g's case the 'moderator' is the receiving
     address for the list, i.e. love-hounds@uunet.uu.net. More intelligent
     news software does know about this and if you post an article instead
     of sending it to the moderator's address these systems act in one
     of three ways:

     1. Your article is thrown away. This is the reason why a lot of new
        readers don't find their articles in the news system. If you
        experience this, you have to use the love-hounds@uunet.uu.net
        address by yourself.
     2. Your article is re-packaged and forwarded to the moderator. While
        doing this, the news software insists on creating a new header.
        This is responsible for most of the postings with some news system
        as the sender and without any subject. It may be the case that your
        article actually is shown correctly on your news system, especially
        if the system forwarding it to the moderator isn't yours. In this
        case you might wonder why replies or follow-ups to your articles
        don't have any subject. If you experience this, you should either
        bug your system administrator (to change the behaviour to the third
        one below) or use the email address.
     3. Your article is directly forwarded to the moderator. This is perfectly
        ok, since then your name and subject lines survive.

     Be assured again that no article you write is thrown away due to its
     contents or your person. It's just the wrong way of posting it, since
     the whole process is fully automatised.



2.   What is discussed on Love-Hounds? What not? Where then? Chatting!

     Topics of interest to Love-Hounds include other alternative female
     artists, and Kate-related others like Peter Gabriel and Roy Harper.
     Many new discoveries have been brought to our attention by Vickie Mapes
     (of Vickie'n'Chris), whose radio show "Suspended in Gaffa" focuses on
     alternative female artists, airing Wednesdays from 7:30 to 8:30pm on
     WZRD in Chicago (88.3 FM), and Mondays between 10 and midnight on KKFI
     (90.1 FM) in Kansas City.

2.1. Who is Happy Rhodes?

     Love-Hounds was founded with the idea of being a newsgroup about
     "Progressive Artists with emphasis on Kate Bush", so discussions
     about other "progressive artists" are generally encouraged. However,
     occasionly the talk about a different artist grows to a point where
     it is appropiate to form a seperate group. This is what happened
     with Happy Rhodes (this is really her name), whose CD "Warpaint" has
     spawned a #1 hit on Philadelphia's NPR station. HR traffic has been
     moved to a mailing-list that grows more and more active and now
     includes many other female artists, shadowing the gaffa-flow.

2.2. Who is Tori Amos?

     Another spin-off is the Tori Amos mailing list: Really-Deep-Thoughts.
     The address to subscribe to the mailing list is:

        rdt-request@gradient.cis.upenn.edu.

     The address to post to the mailing list is:

        rdt@gradient.cis.upenn.edu.

     [are there other mailing lists that should appear here?]

2.4. Kate-talk, our very own version of IRC

     "Kate-talk" is a process that allows fans to talk to each other in real
     time. For more info contact Jessica at jessica@cs.rutgers.edu, who
     provides the following information: "You need a unix machine or a vms
     machine, connected directly to the internet. It compiles fairly easily
     on most unix machines. If you have trouble with yours, I'm willing to
     help get it running. Client programs can be ftped from hardees.rutgers.edu
     in /pub/icb-client.tar.Z for the unix client and in the pub/icb directory
     for the vms client. I know nothing about vms, and do not have a vms
     account, so I can't help much for vms people, and I don't have a clue what
     to do with the files that are there. I'd appreciate someone on a vms
     system trying it out for me :)"



3.   Love-Hounds and their netiquette

3.1. Famous Love-Hounds

     A less frequent visitor these days is the numinous curmudgeon "IED",
     Andy Marvick's self-parody as the ultimate "true believer" Katefan.
     IED used to act as the flame-wielding bouncer of the group, but seems
     to have mellowed of late into the more natural role of encyclopedic
     demigod. Come back soon, IED! [or rather: stay around a bit longer!]

3.2. Flame-wars &amp; abbreviations.

     Katefans are generally the nicest people you could hope to meet, but
     r.m.g. does erupt fairly regularly into classic Usenet flamewar-
     behavior. **We're les concierges, chez-nous, honey, and we let the
     weirdness in.** This tender agreement sometimes gets abused, and we
     try to do the best we can to uphold our ideals in the face of mindless
     astral violence, as Kate would surely want. (If you consider that what
     you write here may one day be read by her... be kind to everybody's
     mistakes, huh?) Newcomers can rest assured that you are welcome to
     participate, and if you feel ignored or incinerated you can be pretty
     sure it's nothing personal, and persist until you feel accepted... for
     if your interest is genuine, you certainly will be. The best way to
     deal with rude and/or uninteresting posts is to ignore then and post
     something positive and interesting.

     Abbreviations commonly used on Love-Hounds include sideways faces, such
     as :-), IMHO (In My Humble Opinion), ROFL (Rolling on the floor
     laughing) and the initials of Kate's songs, such as RUTH for Running Up
     That Hill (sometimes known as DwG for Deal with God ;^).

3.3. What is Katemas?

     Love-Hounds celebrate Kate's birthday (Katemas) each year around July 30,
     with parties all over the world.

     1991 saw parties in Boston, Washington DC, Cleveland, San Jose, Seattle,
     Austin, Dallas, Iowa City, Chapel Hill, Chicago, Ipswich UK, Sweden, and
     two sites in Australia.

     1992 saw parties in Boston, San Fransisco, Chicago, Australia, Israel,
     and San Diego.

     1993 saw parties in San Jose, Linkvping (Sweden), Columbus, Oxford
     Mississippi, New Jersey, San Diego, Seattle, Chicago (belated&amp;shared),
     Wollongong (Australia).

     Anyone anywhere else?



4.   Kate Bush Info

4.1. Kate Bush - her carreer and Kate as a human being

     Kate's earliest band was called the KT Bush Band, (KT being readable as
     Katie), and all her albums have a KT emplem hidden somewhere on the
     cover or vinyl itself. You might have to have original UK versions of
     the albums to find them. The KT initials can also be seen in the
     "Army Dreamers" video. With the release of the This Woman's Work boxed
     set in the UK, Japan and canada, she introduced a new version of the
     symbol, integrating a "K" and a "T"         _O_
     with the biological symbol for woman:        |&lt;

     Fans of Kate were saddened by the news of the passing of her mother on
     Valentine's day, 1992.

     FAQs and most common answers:

     She's born on July 30, 1958. No, she's not married, but she has a
     longstanding Significant Other: Del Palmer, her bassist, though current
     unconfirmed and undenied rumors state they might have broken up. Yes, she
     smokes, and we all hope she'll stop. Yes, she's a vegetarian, though she
     now eats fish. 5'3", no middle name. She has two brothers, John Carder
     Bush (Jay), born 1944 - he takes many of the photos of Kate that appear on
     her albums - and Paddy Bush, born 1952, who plays many of the exotic
     instruments found on Kate's albums. Yes, she is indeed a fox.

     No, she doesn't hate to tour, just can't find the time between making
     albums and videos. Yes, she appeared on Saturday Night Live in 1978, but
     the tape you can purchase of that show has her edited out! Yes, that's
     Donald Sutherland in the Cloudbusting video. No, we don't have her home
     address!

     Well, at the end of "Hello, Earth" the German words are: "Tiefer, tiefer,
     irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht" This means: "deeper, deeper,
     somewhere in the depth there is a light."

4.2. Basic Discography/Videography

     Kate's new Album, The Red Shoes, is out now. Unfortunately there are no
     plans to tour :-(, but what did you expect? Guest stars on the album
     include Eric Clapton, Prince, Jeff Beck, Colin Lloyd-Tucker, The Trio
     Bulgarka and Nigel Kennedy. At the moment there are two singles: Eat the
     Music in the USA, Rubberband Girl elsewhere. Moments of Pleasure, the song
     she performed on June 20 1993 in the Aspel &amp; Company show, will be the
     next single out in mid-November. Right now three videos have appeared. Two
     versions for Rubberband Girl and a video for Eat the Music. A 40-50
     minutes long film will be shown from mid-November on, called The Line, The
     Cross And The Curve. This film will feature 6 songs from the album.

     Albums and other major collections:

     The Cathy Demos (Twenty three bootleg gems ca. 1975-1977???)
        Five of these are demos of songs that later appeared on albums.
        They are available on various bootlegs. (Anybody have an early 80's
        album called THE EARLY YEARS?) There are also six "Kick Inside demos",
        which include an unreleased song "Scares Me Silly". Also there are two
        Babooshka demos and various other songs on boots.
     The Kick Inside (TKI, 1978):
        Passionate and girlish, includes her British megahit Wuthering Heights.
     Lionheart (LH, 1978):
        Rushed, rewarmed TKI is still absolute genius.
        This album now is available in a special $80 "Lioness At Heart"
        edition, which includes a t-shirt, an album sized photo book, a poster
        and a postcard. It's out of print now, and you might have to search
        a bit.
     Never For Ever (NfE, 1980):
        Kate begins producing, ascends into the sixth level of enlightenment.
        This album is also available in a special edition similar to the
        "A Lioness At Heart" box. Also out of print it additionally includes a
        numbered certificate.
     The Dreaming (TD, 1982):
        The Seventh Level of Enlightenment. Too naked for more timid souls.
        Play it... LOUDER!
     The Singles File (1984):
        Box of all UK 7" vinyl singles up to 1984, *tres* collectible.
     Hounds of Love (HoL, 1985):
        One side delectably bright, one side deliciously shadowy. The shadowy
        side is a never-filmed movie of a drowning woman's last hours in the
        sea. Does she survive? Kate says so, your mileage may vary.
     The Whole Story (TWS, 1986)
        Compilation-cum-video.
     The Sensual World (TSW, 1989):
        Her "most feminine" album, whatever that means. Noisily engineered.
        Some love it, some don't quite love it, especially "Reaching Out".
     This Woman's Work Boxed Set (TWW, 1990).
        Not released in the USA, only in UK, Japan, Canada and France. Awfully
        pricey, and no lyrics or credits on the extra disks. The box includes
        all 6 regular albums (no TWS of course) as well as two special extra
        discs that normally aren't availlable separately. These two discs
        contain almost all B-sides, dance-mixes and other incidentals. Some
        are unfortunately missing, major ones are: Dreamtime (The Dreaming
        instrumental/remix), Running Up That Hill (instrumental), The Sensual
        World (instrumental), Be Kind to My Mistakes (original soundtrack album
        version, much longer than and very different from the single re-mix,
        most like it better), The Confrontation (instrumental from the Comic
        Strip film GLC). It doesn't contain any previously unreleased material
        or session work with other artists. Great music though, yeah! And the
        first time most of these songs are availlable on CD.

        The French version is a re-shrink-wrapped UK version. The Canadian
        version, currently easily available, does contain the Canadian CDs
        which do have thinner booklets for some of the regular albums that
        do not always contain the lyrics. The Japanese version has:

            - no stickers (4, 8 or 12 or so almost identical KTfems symbols.
              Tell us if you think of something to do with 'em?)
            - more/bigger books in Japanese with non-canonical lyrics in
              English and Japanese, especially also for the two special CDs.
            - the Japanese album covers for TKI and NfE, and
            - the mythical "better-sounding CDs" (tell us if you believe this).
              [actually Japanese CDs are better pressed and more within the
              specifications, but on good players this doesn't matter.]
     The Red Shoes (TRS, 1993):
        Her "most accessible" album. At first it sounds untypical for Kate,
        but this has been valid for every new album so far. There will be
        several special editions of this album, one official from UK, one
        official from the USA, and several inofficial repackagings.

     Official video tapes/laserdiscs:

     Live At The Hammersmith Odeon (1981):
        TV special of Kate's only concert tour, unfortunately it contains only
        one hour out of the two and a half hour show.
     The Single File (1983):
        Contains all of Kate's video up till 1983. Similar to The Whole Story,
        but contains five videos not on The Whole Story (the earlier Wow
        video, Hammer Horror, Them Heavy People, Suspended In Gaffa, There
        Goes A Tenner) and it lacks the newer videos. Not availlable in the
        USA, but it's available on import from Canada.
     Hair Of The Hound (1986):
        This tape is now out of date since all four videos from the Hounds of
        Love album are also on The Whole Story.
     The Whole Story (1986):
        Contains most of Kate's videos up to 1986: All songs from the
        corresponding album plus the video for The Big Sky. The video to
        Experiment IV is only availlable here, so TSF + HOTH isn't sufficient.
     The Sensual World (1989):
        Contains three videos from that album and interview footage. The
        American version contains much less interview footage than the
        British version. The British version is the complete 1989 VH-1 special.

     Soon to come (hopefully): The Line, The Cross, and The Curve - the new
     40-50 minutes film around 6 songs from the new album The Red Shoes.

     There are also far more than a hundred "underground" videos, which
     are traded among fans and are shown at Katemas parties and the like.
     These are primarily television performances and interviews.

     Kate has worked with a lot of other artists:

     - Roy Harper:
       - You (The Game Part II). From "The Unknown Soldier"
       - Once. From "Once"
     - Peter Gabriel:
       - No Self Control,
       - Games Without Frontiers. Both from "III (melted face)"
       - Don't Give Up. From "So"
       - Keine Selbstkontrolle,
       - Spiel ohne Grenzen. Both from the German version of "III"
       There are remixes of Games Without Frontiers. Don't Give Up exists in

4.3. Printed books

     Printed books on Kate are numerous, more details about and corrections
     to these books are available in the archives:

     Kate Bush - A Visual Documentary (1988):
        Probably the best liked book overall.
     Kate Bush Complete (1987):
        "Official" book containing the sheet music to all of Kate's songs up to
        1986. Also contains separate lyrics, a great chronology, many photos,
        and a discography.
     Cathy (1986):
        Book of photos of Kate as a child, by her brother, John Carter Bush.
        No longer available. :-(
     The Illustrated Collector's Guide To Kate Bush (1991):
        Book with details and pictures of all kinds of Kate Kollectables, fun
        even for non-collectors. To order send $13.95 to C-SIDE RECORDS,
        PO BOX 8456 CLEARWATER, FL 34618. Phone 1-813-461-4327. C-SIDE is
        also a good place to get all kinds of Kate stuff, be sure to get on
        their mailing list.
     Kate Bush - The Whole Story (1988):
        Despite appearances, not a sanctioned book, and certainly not the whole
        story. Positive, but contains numerous factual and publishing errors.
        For "The Whole Story" on this book, see Andrew Marvick's review in the
        archives.
     Kate Bush - The First Twelve Years (1992):
        Homeground says: is another collection of newpaper and magazine cutting
        covering the years from 1978 in two volumes selling for about L12-00 in
        Britain and L15 postpaid to America.  Details can be obtained via the
        fanzine Never For Ever. [See below]
     Kate Bush - With Love (1988):
        Reprints of Kate-related articles, interviews, and reviews, some
        positive, some negative. Interesting mainly to see how the music press
        has reacted to Kate over the years.
     Secret History of Kate Bush (And The Strange Art Of Pop) (1983):
        Intellectual (as opposed to intelligent) book abut Kate's family
        history, story, and fans. Commonly available, but only recommend for
        the photos.
     Kate Bush: Princess of Suburbia by Fred and Judy Vermorel (1980?):
        Not so good. Hard to find.
     Kate Bush: An Illustrated Biography (1980) by Paul Kerton:
        Positive but error-prone book. Hard to find. Was also available in
        German.

4.4. Fanzines

     After being on love-hounds for a few months, most fans find the
     fanzines rarely have information they have not already heard. The most
     common fanzines are the Kate Bush Club (KBC) and Homeground. More
     about these and other fanzines can be found in "The Garden". See section
     4.5 for details.

     Kate Bush Club (KBC):
        The KBC unfortunately only seems to come now when there is a new
        album out, but is always worth the wait as it has original articles
        by Kate and her family and lots of great photos.

        KBC
        PO Box 120
        Welling, Kent, DA16 3DS
        UK

     Homeground
        Homeground comes out almost regularly and has news, great
        articles, stories, and drawings.

        Homeground
        PO Box 176
        Orpington, Kent, BR5 3NA
        UK

     Never For Ever
        Never For Ever is another long-establish fanzine.

4.5. Electronic books

     Two priceless resources for Katefans have recently been made available,
     both of which are much more interesting then anything published. They
     can be ftped from ftp.uu.net, as usual. See section 5 for details.

     "The Garden"
        The Garden is Andrew Marvick's compilation of reference material on
        Kate, [availible in .../kb/garden] including a detailed chronology of
        her life and career (much more complete then anything available
        anywhere else) [GARDEN01]. Also, a listing of all known Kate
        recordings, videography (which includes both official videos and the
        television appearances), and an extensive list of fan magazines
        [GARDEN02]. ALL of the lyrics (including background voices) to ALL of
        Kate's known songs (including unreleased songs) [GARDEN04]. All of
        John's and Paddy's [GARDEN03] interviews and articles for the Kate Bush
        Club Newsletter, as well as Kate's articles for the KBC [GARDEN05,
        GARDEN06]. Also included are about sixty interviews [GARDEN07 through
        GARDEN10].

     "Cloudbusting - Kate Bush In Her Own Words"
        This is Ron Hill (the [ex-]keeper of this monthly post)'s compilation
        of almost 200 interviews, sorted by song, story, and subject order,
        forming the closest we may ever see to a full-fledged Kate
        autobiography. It is available in regular text format, or in
        Wordperfect 4.2 format, which makes use of Wordperfect's underlining,
        bolding, and italizing, ability, and contains an extensive index. It
        is also available in MacWrite II, PostScript, and Word 4.0 versions.
        (Eventually the extra unedited interviews will be added into The
        Garden).

        There are also a series of Cloudbusting GIF (picture) files, which are
        located in .../kb/cloudbusting/gif [APPARENTLY THESE ARE TRASHED]. A
        title page [CTITLE.GIF and a larger version, CTITLEB.GIF], a title page
        for Part II [CSTORY.GIF] and part III [CSUBJECT.GIF], a credits screen
        [CREDITS.GIF], and a pic of 3 inch disk label [CLABEL.GIF, and a b&amp;w
        version CLABELBW.GIF]. There are also pictures for most of the albums
        which show the picture of Kate from the album cover next to a listing
        of songs [titles begin with "O"]. There are also "alternative" pics for
        some of the albums, which  show pictures SIMILAR to but not identical
        to the album covers [files begin with "A"]. There are also "full"
        pictures for some of the albums [titles begin with "F"], which are the
        raw, uncropped, pictures.

        Cloudbusting is available in .../kb/cloudbusting. The text version is
        in .../kb/cloudbusting/text. Filenames are cloud0.txt, cloud1a.txt,
        cloud1b.txt, cloud1c.txt, cloud2a.txt, cloud2b.txt, cloud3a.txt, cloud
        3b.txt, cloud3c.txt, cloud4.txt, cloud5.txt, clouds.txt. It is also
        available compressed with ZIP in .../kb/cloudbusting/zip as filenames
        cloud045.zip, cloud1.zip, cloud2.zip, cloud3.zip.

     "Deeper Understanding - A collection of Kate Bush articles"
        This third, in-progress book, also by Ron Hill, will compile the "best
        of" the Love-Hounds as well as a few articles from fan magazines and
        lots of published reviews. It'll be about five megs in size.

5.   The Archives

     The love-hounds archive resides on ftp.uu.net [137.39.1.9], in the
     directory /usenet/rec.music.gaffa - if you don't know how to do ftp
     (or what ftp is), then see section 5.3. All pathnames with '...' at
     the beginning should have '/usenet/rec.music.gaffa' before them.

     There's also an incoming directory.

     Most of these files can also be found on Dave Datta's music archive
     residing on ftp.uwp.edu.

5.1. Previous messages from love-hounds

     All previous messages from love-hounds can be ftped from the archives,
     residing in yearly directories under .../archives. Normally the archives
     are a bit behind reality, at the moment the messages up to June 93 are
     in the archives. The rest will follow whenever Bill has time.

5.2. Other files

     All other files are in .../kb. These include:

     - The two electronic books mentioned above
     - lyrics to ALL songs
     - interviews
     - reviews
     - pictures, mostly GIF, all under .../kb/pix:
       - from the 1990 Kate Bush Convention, including pics of Kate's house
         and a Love-Hounds group pic (lovename.pic)
       - from the Cathy book (cathy??.gif)
       - from the This Woman's Work booklet (TWW??.gif)
       - from the Tour of Live booklet (page_??.gif)
       - from all albums [anyone with The Red Shoes?]
       - and uncounted more

       To view these GIFs you will need a program for your type of computer.
       Public domain picture file viewers include CSHOW and PICEM for the IBM,
       TURBOGIF and HAMGIF for the Amiga, Giffer or QuickGif for the
       Macintosh, and ImageViewer for the NeXT.

5.3. How to do ftp?

     To use ftp directly you have to have direct access to the internet.

     You connect by typing

        ftp ftp.UU.NET              [or: ftp 137.39.1.9]

     Log in as "anonymous" or "ftp" and use your username as your password.
     To change directories e.g. type

        cd /usenet/rec.music.gaffa

     Other commands are:

        dir &lt;dirname&gt;       [get a directory, &lt;dirname&gt; is optional, current
                             if omitted]
        get &lt;filename&gt;      [get the requested file]
        bin                 [set transfer to binary mode, this is needed
                             for pictures and compressed files. Best is
                             if you always do 'bin' first, so you don't forget]
        bye                 [end the ftp session]

     If you don't have FTP (file transfer ability) you can still get the files
     by using an FTP mail server run by DEC. You send it a list of commands
     and then it sends you the files as regular mail messages, so anyone who
     has the ability to send and receive private mail can use this. If a file
     is larger then 60k it will be send as more than one message.

     If you want to GET binary files (GIF picture files, Wordperfect files, or
     anything that's not straight text) it will send you the files in a
     special text format called UUENCODED, you will need a program called
     UUDECODE for your computer to decode these. Note that this is not always
     the most relible way of getting files, ie you may have to do it several
     times.

     To start off using this, send a message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com, the
     first message should read simply HELP - don't bother with a subject line
     as these are ignored. You will be sent back the basic commands and some
     examples, read this carefully (as much as you are able to understand).
     Here are some specific examples for accessing the love-hounds archives,
     don't type the parts in brackets []. Note that when typing in file names,
     upper and lower case are important! Parts in &lt;&gt; have to replaced by
     something useful.

        get GARDEN02                    [GET another file, only 10 at once]
        quit

        binary                          [specify BINARY format]
        get LOVENAME.GIF

     the BBSes listed above offer the GIFs and many of the other files too.
