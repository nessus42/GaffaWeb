There I was, expecting to have to wait until Tuesday to get a
copy of TRS.  Friday morning I heard a local radio station
announce that they'd be giving copies of the CD away, but I
didn't hear what the rules for the contest were.

Later that afternoon I heard them play "Man With the Child.."
and called the station to find out how to win the CD.  The DJ
played three songs and asked for callers to tell them which
songs had been played, and which albums they were from.  After
hearing ETM and RUTH I made a list.  I know, I know, I shouldn't
have had to write them down, but I was nervous that I'd mess
something up and LOSE.  I was the first caller through and in a
shaky voice, read my list to the DJ.

Since the station's office is only open till 5:30 I had to leave
work early on Friday to pick up my prize.  I hurried across
town, fretting all the while that I would make it to the
station just as they locked the doors.  I imagined the
receptionist laughing maniacally as I banged on the door,
begging for my copy of TRS.

Anyway, I guess the promo contest was a success because the 
receptionist told me that people had been coming in all day to 
pick up the CD and that the winners all had the same reaction
that I did.  Maybe this bodes well for TRS.  I hope so.

Richard and I listened to it Friday night, and Saturday night we 
took the CD to a Halloween party.  It was a hit.  Several people 
asked about the album, so I hope they are interested enough to 
go buy TRS.  Winning that CD made my weekend.  After over a
month of listening to the tape, I was thrilled to get the CD.
There's so much we missed.  Now to get the video...
