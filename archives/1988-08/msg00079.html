The following article appears in this week's NME. I think all those who have
heard any of the Voix Bulgares discs or the Trio Bulgarka will be very
excited about the news that Kate is including Bulgarian voices on the new
album. There's even mention of a tour (well kinda).

******************************************************************************

		Down at the old Bul and Bush

	Len Brown - New Musical Express 12th November 1988
		Copyright IPC Magazines Ltd. 1988

Kate Bush and Yanka Rupkina sit on a bean-bag couch and sing to me,
Bulgarian style; Rupkina bleating high and joyous above Bush's
harmony.

Short but sweet, a brief musical meeting of East and West, it's the
sort of sensual aural treat every philanthropist would wish to share
with the World.  Except that the World would have been pushed to fit
in this studio broom cupboard off Upper Street, Islington.

We are talking here, my friends, about the power of music. Not 'music'
to make megabucks, or 'music' to drop acid to, or 'music' to make you
forget, but music that stimulates the pleasure senses and gently feeds
emotions. We are talking Trio Bulgarka, those legendary Balkan vocal
veterans - Rupkina, Stoyanka Boneva, and Eva Georgieva - who find
themselves contributing to Kate Bush's first album in three years.

While a Beeb camera crew films the Trio - in technicolour national
costume, laughing and chattering through 'Dva Kornie' - for the
Rhythms of the World series, I find myself closeted with the
traditionally taciturn Kate Bush. She rarely agrees to interviews
these days, and rarely agrees to interviews these days, and rarely
allows outsiders to intrude on her studio work, yet here she is
relaxed - all in black with long flames of hair - and glad to be back
making music. Particularly with the Bulgarians.

Her Bulgar obsession stems from her brother Paddy,
multi-instrumentalist and student of ethnic musics and musicians.

"He had this tape of Bulgarian voices, three years ago," says Kate,
"just when we were finishing "Hounds of Love'. It was the most
incredible thing I've ever heard, beautiful. So I decided I wanted to
work with them in some form in the future ... But it takes me a long
time to digest ideas - even if I read a book it maybe won't come out
into a song until four years later. So I wrote a track with a
choir-synthesiser sound hoping that if we could get to work with them,
they would take the weight of the song from the synthesisers."

She made contact with Trio Bulgarka through their British
producer/promoter/ friend/Bragg associate Joe Boyd of Hannibal
Records, who released the 'Balkana' compilation in '87 and the Trio's
own 'The Forest is crying' LP earlier this year. Two weeks ago Kate
visited Bulgaria and returned with the Trio to record two tracks in
London.

"I was very worried because chances were it might not work," she
admits, "particularly because they're so good. It might just sound
like we'd bunged them in a Western track. I really didn't want them to
be dragged down to my level. I was worried that they wouldn't want to
get involved with Western pop music, because it has a bad name and a
lot of people are initially scared of it ... I don't blame them at
all."

"We had to get a special arranger (Dmitr Penev) because the beauty is
not just in the voices but also in the ancient arrangements. He was
brilliant, it couldn't have been better, the way we managed to
communicate exactly what we wanted despite language problems ... It
sounds corny but I do feel very honoured."

The raw results of these sessions which I hear by accident, sound
impressive.  Any fears that Bush might be dabbling in some sort of
Bulgarian 'Duck Rock' or even 'Graceland' territory are dispelled by
the true spirit of the recording; the emotion of the Trio's
traditional singing is beautifully complimented by Kate's distinctive
vocal. The Trio sing Bulgarian words, so perhaps the Azanian chorals
of Gabriel's 'Biko' would be a closer reference point, although
there's not quite such a potent message here.

"You're not distracted by words," suggests Kate, "all you're picking
up are the emotions that they're translating to you. It feels like
very deep information.  There's one point when Yanka's belting it out,
really fantastic, yet she's singing something like, 'Marco sits down
with his mother and has some bread and jam'!"

That's one of the strange things about Bulgarian music. You find
yourself sitting, listening, awe-struck, lump-throated, only to find
you've been moved to tears by a song about a bumble-bee or a mosquito
playing the bagpipes or dark-eyed Yanka's marigolds ("I mislaid my
kavals by your gates last night, Elenke, did you see them?"). Whatever
they sing about it always comes over as powerful, spine-tinglingly
heartfelt (particularly their lament for the Bulgarian Robin Hood
Indje Voivode). Just listen and it's easy to understand why Kate Bush
and others have been drawn to this music, this antithesis of producer
pop for inspiration.

"If they sing 'Strati Angelaki' to me I can't take it," confesses
Kate, "I have to leave the room, it just makes me cry and there are
very few things musically that affect me like that."

Rather than increasing the difficulties, the language barrier between
Kate and the Trio seems to have promoted their personal and working
relationship.

"I've been so excited doing it and it's so lovely for me to work with
women as well, a tremendous difference. And because we can't talk
intellectually - we can't talk about the state of Bulgaria or even
what the shops are like in London - our whole communication is totally
emotional.

"It's an incredible experience, the warmth they give you, you don't
often get it from Westerners. Here it's very much a communication of
'I have this, you don't have that' or 'I don't have that and you do',
whereas they want to know what kind of person you are ... you can feel
them probing your heart."

Bush has, of course, experimented before with global ideas on odd
tracks: 'Egypt', 'Kashka from Bagdad', the aboriginally-inspired 'The
Dreaming', the Greek rhythms and portentous use of Bulgarian teppan
(drum) on 'Jig of Life'.  Here, the Bulgarian singers are playing a
more central role than previous ethnic musicians (Esmail Sheikh, Donal
Lunny, Liam O'Flynn, Rolf Harris), employed to compliment Kate's
attempts to create lasting pop rather then quick cash.

It's been a strange experience for Trio Bulgarka, who are more used to
the familiar string drones of the gadulka or the strummed tambura or
the piping gaida than to Bush-style pop experimentalism. They seem,
however, to have adapted with remarkable ease.

"Kate's very popular in Bulgaria," says Yanka Rupkina through
interpreter Borimira Nedeva, "young people like her very much. She
sings emotionally.  there's lots of lovely thinking in her writing and
she's a very good musician.  It is our first time with such a famous
singer and we hope we'll work with her in the future, if we haven't
caused her too many worries."

There's the distinct, appealing prospect of Bush (in full Bulgarian
gear?)  performing live with the Trio; it's been donkeys since the
Theatre of Kate was last seen onstage (benefits aside) but, she says,
"if anything could make me tour again it would be the people in this
studio".

In the meantime we should be glad she's back in the studio; in the
80's she's proved to be one of the few artists with the courage to
disappear for years and return with original, quality creations.
('Running up that Hill' was voted 13 in NME Top 150 Singles of All
Time February 1987). After her initial late '70s/early '80s burst of
energy, it was three years before 'Hounds of Love' followed 'The
Dreaming' and, 'The Whole Story' singles compilation aside, it's been
even longer this time.

"I find it very difficult, nothing comes easy to me. I don't know if
I'm a perfectionist, although people say that about me. I just find it
harder each time to write songs. Ten songs doesn't sound many but you
want each to say something about you and who you are at this point in
time; to say something new. But the more you put into something the
harder it becomes.

"Making an album for me is very much a psychological process; it's
very painful and it gets more painful each time. I think it's hard for
people to understand because it seems so silly, an album's such a
trivial thing really ... I've had to accept a lot of things about
myself for this album that have been hard for me. Every time I kid
myself that an album will take six weeks, but once I get in there and
get halfway through it's too big for me. I think, 'My God, what am I
doing in the middle of this?'"

Well, I know what I'm doing in the middle of all this: enjoying
myself, listening to Kate, to the music, to Bulgarian chattering. So
ears aroused and with a Balkan spring in my step, I leave Kate with
the Trio, wondering to myself how all this works. How it's possible to
unite east and West, ancient and modern, while having to overcome
cultural and linguistic differences. I express my surprise at the
power of non-verbal communication to the translator Borimira,
half-expecting a lengthy treatise on glasnost, perestroika or One
Worldism. But she replies simply: "Emotions are another world's
language."

Ooh, I wish I'd said that.

Kate Bush's fifth [sic] album, Yanka Rupkina's first British solo
album, and BBC 2's Rhythms of the World programme will all appear in
the New Year.

Lyrics from the Trio Bulgarka's 'The Forest is Crying' LP.
