     Donal Lunny has a new solo album out (Donal Lunny Live, 1987).
Liam O'Flynn has a solo album out now, as well -- his first. Both
albums were produced by Donal, and the O'Flynn album features the two
musicians prominently. On the back of Liam's album mention is made
that he has "accompanied the popular singer Kate Bush." This album
contains many of the pieces that Liam and Donal have been playing in
their live concerts together recently.
     IED finally picked up the Kate Bush picture-disk 7" interview
single, which has been mentioned in various mail-order stock-lists for
several months now. The record contains the "official" promotional
interview for _HoL_, conducted in 1986, according to the little
sticker-label that is attached to the clear plastic sleeve of the
record.  (This label is the only identifying mark on the product; it
gives a catalogue number but no label name. It is set in violet
_HoL_-style italic type, and simply says "Kate Bush Interview, 1986".)
     The interview is actually just a tape of Kate's answers (very
stiff, and either carefully rehearsed or read from a self-written
text) interspersed with questions that are obviously being read from a
cue-sheet by an unidentified Cockney-accented voice-over. The quality
of the pressing is okay. The quality of the picture-disk itself is
quite high. Both photos are from about 1985/6, and although the record
is clearly "unauthorized", its production values are certainly as good
as those of the official 7" picture-disk of "The Big Sky".
     In non-KT news, Bill Nelson will have a new Enigma LP/CD out very
shortly, called "Unearthed". No word on whether it will consist of old
or new, instrumental or vocal material. No label ever put out a CD of
"Getting the Holy Ghost Across/Living For the Spangled Moment", or its
US near-equivalent, "On a Blue Wing", though both were given CD
catalogue numbers when they were released on vinyl.
     Kari H. (and others on this group, as well) will be pleased to
learn that Billy Currie (keyboard player and violinist of the now
apparently defunct Ultravox) is about to release his first-ever _solo_
album.
     Both of the above bits of news come courtesy of ICE, the
International Compact Disc Exchange, a monthly news leaflet which
despite its unassuming appearance and length is probably the most
informative CD release information source available these days.
