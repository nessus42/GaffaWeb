I recently picked up a new KT boot (at least I've never seen or heard of it
before--if it was mentioned here, I missed it) called IF YOU COULD SEE ME
FLY.

It is a European pressing and has a black, white, and gold cover with a
composite photo of a Fred &amp; Ginger like pair dancing on a typewriter
keyboard.

The tracks and credits are listed as shown below.  Recorded live 12 May,
1979 at the Hammersmith Odeon, London, except where noted.

side one:
--------

Let It Be
(Lennon-McCartney)
  Kate Bush-vocals
  David Gilmour-vocals, guitar
  Pino Palladino-bass and others

  Steve Harley-2nd lead vocals

Here Comes The Flood
(Gabriel)
  Peter Gabriel-vocals, piano

I Don't Remember
(Gabriel)

  Kate Bush-synthesizer (solo), back-up vocals
  Paddie Bush-guitar
  Stuart Elliot-drums

side two:

Babooshka
(Bush)
  Take 1 &amp; 2
  Kate Bush-vocals, piano
  David Gilmour-engineering, drum programming on Take 2
  both takes recorded at David Gilmour's own studio in 1974


The quality of the Hammersmith material is marginal.  The Amnesty show
track is better, but not great.  The two studio takes of "Babooshka" are
pretty good, though they crackle as if they had been lifted off another
vinyl disc.
