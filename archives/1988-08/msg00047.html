<PRE>
My roommate heard an interview with Herbie Hancock on VH1 (MTV's
'adult demographic' for those who don't get it) the other day in which
Herbie was asked who he would like to work with that he hasn't yet. He
answered Peter Gabriel, KaTe Bush and someone else whose name slipped
my roomie's mind. Herbie then made some comment about them being the
only "pop" musicians he would want to work with - a comment that my
roommate just had to tell me about, seeing as I consider KaTe's music
anything but Pop!!

In other news, the local Tower Records didn't have Midge Ure's latest
solo album in yet, and according to the peroxide head who was behind
the counter, it wasn't on their "arriving-any-day-now" list. He
suggested I try early in Oct. Oh well.

I finally got HoL on CD (I had it on tape before). So tell me, why
doesn't KaTe reKord and/or masTer her stuff digitally? Was 'ADD'
really that expensive/experimental/unreliable back when HoL was
released?

I seem to remember that when HoL was first released, we at KDVS (the
college station at UC Davis that I was on the air at) got a
pinkish/whitish vinyl pressing. Is my memory just fading fast, or was
there really such a pressing? Any idea how much they're worth?

I Kan'T believe I don't know the answer to this, and don't remember it
seeing it being discussed here, but is the character in The Ninth Wave
alive or dead at the end of the piece? By the upbeat nature of "The
Morning Fog" and all the talk about loving one's family more than
ever, I had assumed that the narrator did indeed make it through the
night on the waves.

But the other day I was listened to it (actually I wasn't listening to
it, it was just _on_), and the German at the end of "Hello, Earth"
came on and I remembered the translation posted here (I had been
mis-hearing that for the longest time!) and I thought to myself,
"Self, I don't think our hero made it after all." I can't say exactly
why, but it sure felt to me at that moment that the hero bit it.

Am I being thoroughly obtuse, or is there still 'some questions
remaining' about the survival of the character in "The Ninth Wave"?
(Gee, maybe there's no good answer to that question and we can have
another flame-fest vis-a-vis "Gaffa" about the ice being just a coy
metaphor for KaTe's favorite brand of recording tape)

BTW - "Gaffa" is neither gaffer's tape, nor a place; rather it's the
name of my machine, and yes, KaTe is indeed trapped inside.

BTBTW (By the by the way) - I digitize, synthesized and analyzed the
'backward' stuff in "Watching You Without Me" and it either says:

	1. "IED, IED, IED" and then something about a gnu,
or
	2. "I will tour again, but my only American appearance will be
	    in Nebraska."

I'm kind of hoping it's the first one myself.
