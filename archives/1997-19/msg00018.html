For awhile, I got away from working through the Love-Hound archives,
but I'm back to it and just ran across this, courtesy of our own
invaluable IED:

&gt; From @EDDIE.MIT.EDU,@mitvma.mit.edu:IED0DXM@OAC.UCLA.EDU  Tue Apr  3 18:06:40 1990
&gt; Date:    Tue, 03 Apr 90 11:44 PDT
&gt; From: IED0DXM%OAC.UCLA.EDU@mitvma.mit.edu
&gt; Subject: Another Kate Bush interview
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  To: Love-Hounds
&gt;  From: Andrew Marvick
&gt;  Subject: Another Kate Bush interview
&gt; 
&gt;      &lt;Here is part of a U.S. radio interview from December 1989.
&gt; I do not know the origin of this interview. It was published in the
&gt; maiden issue of a new American fanzine called _Reaching_Out_,
&gt; without specific identification. The interview is prefaced by a
&gt; brief history of Kate's career. Edited by Andrew Marvick
&gt; from a transcription by Cynthia Kiley.&gt;

   [snip]

&gt;      Why have you not toured in so long?
&gt;      "The problem is that since the last tour I've been
&gt; wrapped up in making albums, and trying to keep control of what I
&gt; do. I get so involved in what I do, it's an exhausting, long
&gt; process for me, and really with the albums taking so long over the
&gt; last few years, I don't think I've had space in myself to
&gt; tour. I really enjoyed the last tour--people think I didn't and
&gt; that's why I haven't toured--but it't really more that
&gt; I get so wrapped up in all the projects I do. I don't feel I've
&gt; wanted to do it enough...I don't think I would have done it well
&gt; and maybe that's what I can say. I'm sorry...I don't
&gt; want to starve people with contact. It's just doing what I
&gt; do well is _so_important_ to
&gt; me. I've got to try and do the best I can with everything."
&gt;      Do you think not touring has held your career back in the U.S.?
&gt;      "Well, I think it's very possible, plus I think there
&gt; have been so many other inaccessible areas to me here as an artist.
&gt; I guess my last record company found it difficult to express me
&gt; as an artist to the public, and my second and third albums were
&gt; received here at a later date &lt;1983-1984&gt;. I think people
&gt; must have quite a confusing image of me. In a way this is something
&gt; I have to not worry about too much, um...because that's not
&gt; really my responsibility. My responsibilities are the artistic,
&gt; where I have to make the best record I can at the time, and I
&gt; have to let people know it's out there. But all _those_ areas
&gt; kind of are out of my control."
&gt;      Could you say a few words about the first tour?
&gt;      "Terribly overly ambitious--that's a trait of mine.
&gt; I am terribly over-ambitious with things I try to do. It's
&gt; quite scary trying to deal with such big things.
&gt;      "I think it would be unfair on everyone if I did a tour
&gt; and didn't really want to...I'm not really going to exude
&gt; joy and happiness. It's difficult for me, obviously. I hate
&gt; the thought of a lot of people wanting me to tour and I not.
&gt; It's frustrating for them not to have contact with me as an
&gt; artist, but there are records and videos. This &lt;radio interview&gt;
&gt; is great, because this is direct contact. They can hear I'm
&gt; being asked questions and me replying. It's great, but in
&gt; a way doing interviews for the press is all such a removed process.
&gt; But all I can say is that I think it would be wrong for me to tour
&gt; if I wasn't 100% happy about doing it and thought I could
&gt; do something special. I just think everyone would be unhappy."
&gt;
