Ron writes with too much time on his hands:

&gt;What do these "famous" ("infamous?") lovehounds might look like:
&gt;(eg,  short, tall, dark hair, fat, thin, bald, blond, glasses...etc...)
&gt;
&gt;IED
&gt;
&gt;Karen Newcombe
&gt;
&gt;Chris Williams
&gt;
&gt;Vickie (what's your last name again?)
&gt;
&gt;Me (Ron)
&gt;
&gt;Stev0

Surely everyone knows what Steve looks like from his monthly columns and
his television appearances?  He's a short, attractive Irish-American woman
of mixed race with a wry sense of humor.  No, wait, maybe that was the
other one.

&gt;Rolf Peukert
&gt;
&gt;Uli
&gt;
&gt;Brian Dongray
&gt;
&gt;Wieland Wilker
&gt;
&gt;You may also try with any other lovehound...

Yeah.  Frankly, I'm irked at being left off this list!  ;-)  I'm sure
anyone could guess what I look like -- it's written all over my face -- but
I don't suppose it would make them happier people.

&gt;....I must REALLY be bored to think up this lame-brain scheme....oh well...
&gt;let's see what happens.

If you think you're bored, think how bored the people who respond must be!
I kid, of course -- actually, I've always been fascinated by the difference
between knowing someone by his or her words and finding out what he or she
actually looks like.  Without meaning to, I usually "cast" someone else I
already know in the role of the person I'm trying to visualize.  So for
example, when I think of someone from the Netherlands I'm always reminded
of my old friend Ivo from Hilversum, the only person I've ever met who
enjoys food as much as I do.  When I think of Andrew Marvick, I can't help
but envision my high school chum David, who combined erudition with
enthusiasm in the same way as IED.  I'm certain they look nothing alike; in
such cases I'm always completely wrong in my guesses.  Sometimes alarmingly
so!

I don't think it's ever fair to judge people by their appearances, but
having seen their faces I do have this awful crush on both Emmy May
Lombaerts and Vickie Mapes.  Just don't tell them, okay?
