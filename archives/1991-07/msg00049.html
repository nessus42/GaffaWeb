Anyone seen the Doors Movie yet? I saw it on Saturday and I've been ticked
off ever since.  If you know nothing of the Doors and see this movie, you'd
come away thinking that Jim Morrison discovered sex/drugs/alcohol in 1966 and
then he died in 1971.  In between he led a hedonistic/stoned/drunk life.  
There wasn't a single scene in the film that showed the man straight.  Surely
he must have awoken straight at least once.  When did he write any lyrics?  
When did he sing on the records?  All the movie shows is him messing the recordsup cause he's so far gone.

Oh well, since Oliver Stone's version of Nam was _Platoon_ I guess I shuold have
expected this.  In case you missed Platoon, what happens is that this platoon
goes on manuevers(sp?) for a week and smokes dope, rapes a native, burns a 
village, frags an officer, gets bombed by freindly fire, surfs off the end of a
PT boat, fights in VC tunnels, etc.  Only a bit unrealistic.

But I digress.  Let me finish by saying that what really gets my goat is listen-ing to the movie's actors repeating how much of a waste Morrison's live was 
due to the horror of drugs.  How ninties!!  If there is any one who has read this posting this far and who believes that good ole Kyle Mc-whatever, Val Kilmer,
Meg Ryan, Billy idol, et al have never themselves snorted, smoked, drank, etc.,
then let me tell you about this swampland I have for sale...

Whew!! had to get that out of my system!

Just to get my two-cents in on th ediscussion of the "symbol" hidden on the 
KaTe album covers, Ha-ha try and find them on tthe CDs!  Even knowing where 
they are on the album helps little; I tried using a magnifing glass on the CDs
but the resolution of the photo laughed at me.  Luckily, the one album I own
(HOL) has it fairly clearly so I know what you are all talking about.  

another comment:  strangely enough, I've collected the rest of KaTe's stuff on 
CD via-get this-the used CD method. Form my local record store.  Two of the 
discs are even EMI imports.  If memory serves, I didn't pay over $7 for any of 
them.  I wish I was that lucky all of the time.

My name remains Jimmy.

P.S. Anyone want to talk Doors can mail me privately if they feel the discussionis a bit removed from the intent of this listing.
