OOPS! I noticed a couple of days ago that the latest batch was missing a few
photos.  After a couple of days of delay, I took them in and will now sentthem
out on WENDSDAY.  Sorry for the delay.  Also, I seem to have lost one of the
negative strips so the photo of the Palacias sign is not included (it wasn't a
great shot!).  To make up for it, there is an extra copy of auctioning Kate's
coat picture, the first came out to dark. There may also be a few other poor
shots that were in the first batch but not here but I don't think so.  Also I
am too tired to sort them out so they are a little mixed up.  The photos of
Kate are all in order, but some of the ones before and after are a little
mixed.  If you need me to repost the photo-descriptions, let me know.  Rember
the picture of Kate's farm is the very green one with the white house in the
middle.  They should be to your house in a week America, two week overseas
(judging by the first batch).

        Here is the hopefully corrected list: 
Ed Suranyi  (PAID)
Mike Mendelson  (PAID)
Woj (PAID)
Stephen Thomas (PAID)
Sakari Jalovaara (PAID)

Guy Larry (2 sets) 
Derek Foster (3 sets) 

TIPPI CHAI: I have upgraded your leftovers set to a GREATEST HITS set since
that only costs a little more than what you sent me. 
        I still have one unaccounted for set if anybody wants it (21 America,
26 overseas).  I also have one "BEST OF" set that has about 20 of the best
photos and 20 not-the-best leftover photos.  This is for 7 dollars.  
        I also have several GREATEST HITS sets which is the best 5 photos
combined with the 20 LEFTOVERS photos (I only have 2 LEFTOVER sets so past
that will just get the five photos and the VERY leftovers, got that :-) ). 
The GREATEST HITS goes for 2 dollars. 
        Somebody (I forgot who, sorry) asked me about making them videos.  I
am sorry, but I don't have easy access to two vcrs and also most of the videos
I have are really poor copies. 
        Speaking of Videos, I just watched my new copy of HAMMERSMITH (in
SSTTEERROO for the first time!) WHOOOOOOO......
