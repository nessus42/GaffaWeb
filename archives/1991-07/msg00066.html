Hi,

This has been out for a while in Europe, but apparently got just released
in the US. As soon as I read the post about it I ran and bought it.
It is wonderful. It was filmed in Athens, Greece back in 1987 (about two
months after I came to the US...) at the Lycabettus theater in Athens.
This amphitheater is on a hill that overlooks Athens and several concerts 
in the summer take place there. I have seen Van Morrison and Mike Oldfield 
there and it was incredible. PG gave six (6) concerts there of which the three
were free and were essentially rehearsals for the filming of the video.
I had given up hope about this ever being released, but now I know it was 
worth the wait.

The songs featured are:

This is the Picture, San Jacinto, Shock the Monkey, Games witout Frontiers
(in an incredible versioN!) No self control, Mercy Street, Sledgehammer,
Solsbury HIll, Lay your hands, Don't Give up, In your Eyes, Biko.

It runs for about 85 minutes, and at $19.98 (at Strawberries) it's well
worth buying.

Angelos
PS. 'Tame Yourself' is out. it has some excellent songs by Lene Lovich,
Fetching Bones, Pretenders,etc. It is a little bit radical about Animal
Rights but the music is pretty good.
