&gt; Various people have discussed different meanings to the lyrics of
&gt; Cloudbusting, but what I pose to you all is, what is the significance
&gt; of the train sounds (steam, whistle, etc) at the end of the track?

In 1991, Kate did an interview on the BBC where she commented on each
track of HOL.  When recording Cloudbusting, she was having a terrible
time coming up with an ending.  Fading out caused "everything to fall
apart because it didn't end properly" so she thought "maybe decoy
tactics were the way". "And we covered the whole thing over with the
sound of a steam engine slowing down, so that you had the sense of a
journey coming to an end".  They built the sound out of various other
sounds, including Del going "sssssssssssssss" for the steam.

As to my recent post about "Your son's coming out", I rewrote it three
times trying to word it so that no one would be able to use the word
"homophobic" to describe my post.  I knew that I had failed that task
even before I hit "send".  I was attempting to point out what I
perceived as the incongruity between the interpretation of of that line
and the rest of the song.  If the original poster (still not Ron) had
said "I think he may be saying he is becoming an elephant", I still
would have written the same response substituting "an elephant" for
"gay".

Kim, I agree with you 110%.  Everyone is free to interpret any song,
poem or piece of art in his or her own way, but if you end your opinion
with "Am I missing the point or what?", be prepared for some people
write to say they disagree.  Maybe my sin was stating my opinion with a
little humor and not using a ";-)".  As soon as we clear up the html
problems some people have when receiving these digests, I can start
using the &lt;humor&gt; &lt;/humor&gt; tag. ;-)
