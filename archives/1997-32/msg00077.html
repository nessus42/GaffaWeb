<PRE>
I have been tuning in and out on this whole debate.  A couple of the 
things I read reminded me of a incident from my distant past.

Many years ago, I had the opportunity to watch an artist at work.  I 
just sat there and watched as he worked on a charcoal drawing that was 
extremely - well, I guess surreal.  after watching in silence for 
about 10- 20 minutes I asked him "What does it mean?"  He said "What 
does it mean to you?"  Me:  "I know what it means to *me*, I want to 
know what you are putting into it."

He looked at me, looked at the drawing, then looked at me again.  We 
just sat there for a couple of minutes, then he proceeded to tell me 
what the work meant to him.  what he was trying to portray.  

I don't think he fell in love with me at that moment, but I do know 
that at that moment he definitely saw me in a different light.  
Shortly after, he became my first true love and soul mate. And I KNOW 
I owed it all to that simple exchange.

It matters what we get out of a piece.  But do not forget that it 
matters what is put into it.  Which is more 'important' or 'real?'.  
I think that depends on the individual and / or the piece.  In some 
cases, you will never be able to convince me that what I got out of 
the piece is less important or less real that what the artist put 
into it.  I would fight and debate to no end (much like some of the 
exchanges here lately)  BUT in some cases, what I got out of the 
piece seems insignificant and petty compared to what the artist 
lovingly worked into the piece.  Art is very personal.  On both ends.

For what it's worth,

d~
