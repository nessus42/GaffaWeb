I'm reposting this because my first attempt seems to have fallen into
a bit bucket somewhere.  Sorry if this is a duplicate for anyone...

&gt; Well, I was not disappointed that I went to the convention today.
&gt; It was quite small, it was reported that attendence was 60 people.
&gt; BUT they were all KaTe fans!!! I was told the 1st convention in
&gt; Winnipeg only drew 100 people.

I think later they said something like 70 or 80 people had come and
gone throughout the day.  Considering that most of the turn out was
from the Cleveland area that's not bad.  Ohio is not nearly as devoid
of Kate fans as some might have us beleave!  :-)  Actually I think
they'd have done better if they had gotten word out in the OSU campus
area down here a little sooner.  We'll be glad to help out with that
"next time".  Of course when I say "we" I mean Missy.  :-)

&gt; The event was sponsored by The American Association of Them Heavy People
&gt; (an unofficial KaTe fan club (their statement) for the US) and by
&gt; CD Connection of Northeast Ohio. The proprietor (Scott Sheppard)
&gt; and his friend Cappy both share the honor of having been to all
&gt; the previous KaTe conventions: Winnipeg, London '85 and London '90.

I think we paid for Scott's next convention trip with the stuff we
bought! :-)

&gt; Cappy brought his collection of KaTe memorabilia for everyone to look at. 

This was very kind.  Cappy brought a lot of extremely rare stuff and
let us slobber all over them.  He's probably still got a lot of that
stuff hanging out on the line to dry out.

&gt; Scott had for sale a huge assortment of albums and posters. 

At least he did until we got through.  Scott wanted to auction off
some of his rare collectors items but for the most part these were
fans and not collectors so most items went unsold.  Scott did have
some very interesting promotional items.  He did auction off an
original stand up display from _The Kick Inside_ (you too can have 
Kate in your own home), an autographed promo photo, an autographed 
copy of _The Dreaming_ (to us), and _The Single File_ (also to us).

Financial damage for the day also included the _Running Up That Hill_
12", _Live at the Hammersmith_ on Laser Disc, and some miscellanious
posters, flats and T-shirts.  

&gt; Throughout the day videos were shown almost continously.

There was a lot of interest in videos of the TV appearances.  I wonder
whether a separate video party might be in order.

We also managed to win a poster in the trivia contest, mainly thanks to
all the information available here in Love-Hounds, thanks folks.

At this point I'd like to plug the _Little Light_ newsletter, which
looked like an interesting forum for thoughtful Kate discussion.
Unfortunately, we seemed to have misplaced our copy.  Phil, can you
post the address for information about _Little Light_?

The Kon closed with the reading of personal greetings from Peter
Gabriel, David Gilmour and Kate.  Evidently, numerous unanswered 
registered letters to the Kate Bush Club finally resulted in a phone 
call from Kate herself.   Do any of you Cleveland Love-Hounds happen
to have the text of the message available? 

It was great meeting Phil, Scott, Cappy, Jeff and all the other folks
up there.  We hope to do it again sometime.  Maybe in Columbus! :-)
