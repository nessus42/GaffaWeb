Well it finally happened.  For years I have been wondering why I have never be
moved by Don't Give Up.  I always like what the song was about and the ideas
behind it, but the only time I was moved by it was when I heard the LIVE
version in England.  Anyways I was driving home listening to a "rare Kate
tracks" tape made by a friend and it came up.  BAMB.  I almost started
bawling! :-) The regular version never had the impact of the one time I heard
the live version but today it sure did.  Maybe it was cause I was tired.  I am
making a "Kate's Best" for a new friend of mine and now had to include it,
which really screwed up my careful plans!! (I had to delete "The Fog"!). 
 
TO ANDREW MARVICK:  In cause you are not getting my messages , The Garden is
weeded and the Clouds are busting.  Please send me a message, if possible.

TO DEREK FOSTER:  I have had major problems with your order.  Please leave me
a message!
