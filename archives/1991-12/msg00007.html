   FIrst, a big, public thankyou goes out to Ron Hill, for the 
extrarodinary efforts he has been going to to re-format _The_Garden_
for the sake of other fans' future access. IED couldn't do it
without you, Ron.
  Jeff Tucker, in describing the recent Kate Bush convention, reports
that Cappy Petri and Scott Shepherd (sorry if spellings are wrong)
have attended "every Kate Bush convention". This is untrue. Neither IED
(who first met Scott and Cappy in '85 at the Romford Kate Bush
convention) nor Scott nor Cappy was able to attend the first official
Kate Bush convention, which was organized by the Kate BUsh Club
several years before the Romford con. IED is glad to hear that you
had fun at this new convention. Why is it that news of Scott's
sale of Kate merchandise does not come as a surprise?
   In _GOoMH_, the pursuer (male) _also_ changes into a mule--just
as he has been able to adapt to the earlier tactics of the pursued
(female). Btw, the pursuer says, at the point in question, "Let me
in!" Vickie, IED believes (unless he remembers incorrectly, which 
is certainly very possible) that Kate said _GOoMH_ was "inspired
by", not actually "based on", Stephen King's novel, _The_Shining_.
She also said the movie _Alien_ had had something to do with the
genesis of her recording. But clearly the most direct _influence_
was _The_Twa_Magicians_, the old folk song--not, as far as IED 
can tell, a musical influence, but definitely a narrative one. 
   Jimmy Fingerle asks why Part Two of IED's updated chronology 
never appeared in Love-Hounds. There were two reasons: first, IED
didn't have easy access to the earlier edition; and second, no-one
ever commented on Part One (until now--thanks, Jimmy). This summer
IED hopes to get the rest of the chrono updated and corrected, for
posting in Love-Hounds before Katemas '91.
   Run-out-groove "secret" messages: "We're all playing a hunch"
is a reference (in IED's opinion) to a couple of lines from "Hammer Horror",
in which Kate made a rather clever play on the words "Hunchback of 
Notre Dame". "Happy anniversary to the P's" is still unexplained, but
IED for some reason has always thought that this was an expression 
of good will from Kate to all the Peter Pans out in Kensington Gardens.
   The most interesting of the three run-out-groove messages you 
asked about (at least in IED's opinion), Jimmy, is: "Well done J.B.
1st Dan". This, IED discovered (and confirmed later through an
an independent source) is a message to Kate's brother John Carder
Bush, who had attained a "first dan" in Karate (or possibly another
of the Oriental martial arts) shortly before the cutting of the
record in question. 
   Finally, IED digresses for a moment from his usual subject, to 
comment on Virginia Astley's family: her father is not just any old
movie-score composer. He is Edwin (Ted) Astley, the father of Sixties
spy-genre music. He wrote (arranged, conducted and produced) the
themes and incidental music for the original Patrick McGoohan spy
series _Danger_Man_ way back in 1961; the Roger Moore series _The_
_Saint_; _Randall_and_Hopkirk,_Deceased_; and _Department_S_; as well
as the films _Koroshi_ and _Vendetta_of_the_Saint_. An amazing 
musician, woefully underappreciated today. IED thinks it's fair to
say even that Kate Bush herself could not have recorded some of the
music from _G.L.C._ were it not for the style of music which Astley, 
Senior originated some thirty years earlier.
