&gt;  Also- as to the first few lines of the song:

&gt;"Pray God you can cope
&gt; I stand outside this woman's work
&gt; This woman's world
&gt; Ooh, it's hard on the man
&gt; Now his part is over
&gt; Now starts the craft of the father"

&gt;When I consider these lines as one segment by themselves, sometimes I get
&gt;the feeling that she's talking about childbirth. Does anyone else see this?
&gt;Or is it just me? (Sometimes I think I don't understand any of it...) even
&gt;if you spelled it out for me it might take some explaining before I'd 
&gt;understand it completely!

&gt;                         judi
YES YES YES YES YESSSSSSSSS!

Sorry, I just couldn't believe the song when I first heard it.  I was watching
*She's having a baby*  and during the delivery scene when she is experiencing
some difficulty and her husband is not being allowed in.  He is forcibly
removed from the scene by a nurse.  I was moved to tears by this juxtaposition
of the movie and this song by possibly one of the greatest lyricist/musicians
of all time.  I just sat and thought about the situation and compared my own
possible life experiences.  My wife and I have never had any children and
now I see the event in a manner not heretofore experienced.
I could babble on and on so I'll stop right here.
Just bloody brilliant...
And the *goddess*, I love it...
Great, fantastic, super, *WOW*...
