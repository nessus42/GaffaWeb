Oooh, just the minor difference that all the CDs are the Japanese
editions with kanji for much of the titles and liner notes. :-)  They
also leave out the stickers (oooooooh no!) and insert an extra
booklet full of kanji.  It looks like some sort of chronology of Kate's
career.  At least that's what was in the Japanese set at the Kon this
weekend.

Heeeey, what happened to the imfamous B-sides liners that someone was
working on? :-)

nd his friend Cappy both share the honor of having been to all
&gt; the previous KaTe conventions: Winnipeg, London '85 and London '90.

I think we paid for Scott's next convention trip with the stuff we
bought! :-)

&gt; Cappy brought his collection of KaTe memorabilia for everyone to look at. 

This was very kind.  Cappy brought a lot of extremely rare stuff and
let us slobber all over them.  He's probably still got a lot of that
stuff hanging out on the line to dry out.

&gt; Scott had for sale a huge assortment of albums and posters. 

At least he did until we got through.  Scott wanted to auction off
some of his rare collectors items but for the most part these were
fans and not collectors so most items went unsold.  Scott did have
some very interesting promotional items.  He did auction off an original
stand up display from _The Kick Inside_ (you too can have Kate in your 
own home), an autographed promo photo, an autographed copy of _The
Dreaming_ (to us), and _The Single File_ (also to us).

Financial damage for the day also included the _Running Up That Hill_
12", _Live at the Hammersmith_ on Laser Disc, and some miscellanious
posters, flats and T-shirts.  

&gt; Throughout the day videos were shown almost continously.

There was a lot of interest in videos of the TV appearances.  I wonder
whether a separate video party might be in order.

We also managed to win a poster in the trivia contest, mainly thanks to
all the informatio available here in Love-Hounds, thanks folks.

At this point I'd like to plug the _Little Light_ newsletter, which
looked like an interesting forum for rational Kate discussion.
Unfortunately, we seemed to have misplaced our copy.  Phil, can you
post the address for information about _Little Light_?

It was great meeting Phil, Scott, Cappy, Jeff and all the other folks
up there.  We hope to do it again sometime.
