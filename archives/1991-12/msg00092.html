[wrt whether TWW's video is from the man or woman's point of view]

Um.  I dunno.  I've only watched it two or three times (one of the big problems
of not having my own VCR).  To me, it's from the man's point of view--we 
experience the man's anguish at watching his loved one collapse, and then
trying to cope with the waiting-room experience.  Perhaps there's a hint of
"Hello Earth" in here--he's just "floating" there in the waiting room, then
he relives the experience that brought him to that point.  But I digress...


&gt;When I consider these lines as one segment by themselves, sometimes I get
&gt;the feeling that she's talking about childbirth. Does anyone else see this?

Bingo!  "This Woman's Work" actually dates from 1988 (or is it '87?  '88 I
think).  It was written for the soundtrack of the John Hughes movie _She's
Having A Baby_ (Kevin Bacon and I don't recall whom else).  The song was 
written for...you guessed it!...the sequence during which Kevin Bacon is
in the waiting room and his wife is in the delivery room--he's reliving
their life together through a series of flashbacks, scared to death that
something will happen to her during childbirth.  To be honest, I like the
sequence in the film a *lot* better than the video.  It's stunning.

Sigh.  Looks like it's time to pull out TSW and put on "This Woman's Work."
