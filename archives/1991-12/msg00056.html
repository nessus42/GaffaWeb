Fellow Love Hounds:

  Since it's been a while and nobody has come forth with a CD booklet
for _This Woman's Work_, I have taken it upon myself to make one.
Chalkhills subscribers may have seen the booklet I produced for XTC's
_Rag &amp; Bone Buffet_, a similar collection of B-sides and rare tracks.

  I am attempting to collect as much information as I can about the
recording, performance, and release of the tracks on _This Woman's
Work_.  I have started with the first CD of the set ("The Empty
Bullring" to "Be Kind To My Mistakes", for you non-CD owners).

  Here is the information I have been able to glean from my own
collection and my Love-Hounds archives.  Thank you to Jeff and Ed for
help with finding the lyrics.

  Please examine the information below, and if you have any corrections,
elucidations, and any other additional information, please E-MAIL it to
me (relph@presto.ig.com).  If you send it to Love-Hounds or post it to
rec.music.gaffa I may not see it.

	-- John
