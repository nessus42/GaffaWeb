Vickie here. Request and ye shall receive (most of the time)
These lyrics came from the lyric sheet in Roy Harper's LP. I added
the K &amp; P breakups when I submitted it to Break-Through about a
million years ago. I already had it transcribed and on a floppy
because a Cocteau Twins fan e-mailed a request for the lyrics
a couple of months ago. I've left on part of the letter I wrote
to him.

                        Another Day      written by Roy Harper

Peter:
      The kettle's on, the sun has gone another day.
      She offers me Tibetan tea on a flower tray.
      She's at the door, she wants to score,
      She dearly needs to say,

Kate: 
      I loved you a long time ago, you know,
      where the wind's own forget-me-nots blow
      but I just couldn't let myself go
      not knowing what on earth there was to know.
      But I wish that I had,       
      'cos I'm feeling so sad
      that I never had one of your children.

Peter:
      And across the room inside a tomb
      a chance is waxed and wanes.
      The night is young, why are we so hung up
      in each others chains.
      I must take her, I must make her
      while the dove domains
      and feel the juice run as she flies
      run my winds under her sighs
      as the flames of eternity rise
      to lick us with the first-born lash of dawn.

Kate:
      Oh really my dear
      I can't see what we fear
      sat here with ourselves in-between us.

Peter:
      And at the door we can't say more
      than just another day

Kate:
      And without a sound
      I turn around
      and I walk away.

Well, it's a bit obscure, but still very moving.  In case you're curious,
when K&amp;P did this live, they sat opposite each other at a kitchen table,
in character, wearing the most bored, ho-hum, who cares, expressions on
their faces. Between them, on the wall like a framed painting, is a video
screen showing the characters as feeling, hurting, anguished human beings
also sitting at a kitchen table. It's interesting. The foreground characters
are acting the way a lot of people act when they're hurt. Put on an act and
pretend it doesn't affect you. The background characters are acting out the
emotions that the foreground characters are keeping bottled up. Pride keeps
the couple from saying "I'm sorry" and trying to work it out. Love is lost.
It's all very wasteful and sad.
