<PRE>
   IED here, after returning from a trip to Europe and England.  While in
the London area he was very fortunate to meet up with our much admired
and appreciated friends of Homeground Towers, Dave Cross, Peter
Fitzgerald-Morris and Krystyna Fitzgerald.  They were splendid hosts
to this philocanine from beginning to end, and IED never had such good
egg, ham and chips...
   By the way, IED has not had access to Love-Hounds since the end of
August, so he has no idea what wonderful fights you've all been
getting into while he was away, except that he has heard through
second parties that none other than Tracy Robyn Somerville has popped
up in our phosphorous midst to relay news and rumors from above the
49th parallel.  IED cannot provide what our Senators like to call
dispositive evidence, but in conversation with the Homeground crew as
recently as September 30 he was given no reason at all to doubt that
Kate's plans to tour were still very much still on.  
   IED did spend a couple of hours in and around Welling and Abbey
Wood, and was surprised to find a British Rail poster up in the local
railway station using Kate Bush's name (in a sense) to promote family 
rail discounts. Very charming.
   Alas! IED will not be able to join in the discussions here for
another few weeks, as his future city of residence has yet to be 
determined, and his present one is decidedly temporary.  Bill, could
you please continue to send the Digest to IED's UCLA e-mail address as
normal? IED will try to access it there as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, he humbly apologizes to any of you who may have tried in 
vain to reach him by e-mail during the past eight weeks, and hopes you
will be patient with him for a little while longer.
   IED is about to log off now to go pick up _Two_Rooms_, which he
just spotted in a nearby record shop.  N.B.: the "lazerdisk" (sic) 
of _Two_Rooms_ is also supposed to be available domestically as this
is being written--though whether Kate appears on it or not is a
mystery to IED. Meanwhile IED hopes some of you will be keeping a
sharp eye out for Prince's next video(s), esp. airings which identify
the director(s), just in case the credit he gives to Kate in the notes
of his new CD is explained by her involvement in one or more Prince
video projects.
   Take care, everyone.
 
-- Andrew Marvick, from two rooms at the end of the world
