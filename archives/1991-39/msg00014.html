&gt; &gt;     Also, if there are any fans of Kate out there who have not
&gt; &gt;heard Jane Siberry, all I can say is: run, don't walk, to your
&gt; &gt;favourite musical purveyor.
&gt; 
&gt; as richard caldwell will probably no doubt point out, this is not always
&gt; true. it is true for me though. she mixes humor with strange imagery and
&gt; story-telling. i'm more fond of her introspective _the walking_, but
&gt; +the speckless sky_ and _no borders here_ are playfully fun, while still
&gt; retaining that thoughtful spark.

Yeah, at the risk of sounding cynical I'd point that out.  I'd
say walk, don't run to your nearest music store and see if you 
can find something by Jane Siberry in the used bin to try.  If
not, give in sooner or later and lay out the ten to fifteen bucks
for something new.  You may like it.   Siberry's obviously
talented, she has a couple of songs that I really like,  but 
overall she's not my cup of tea.

I'd also put in a plug for Tanita Tikaram who writes fantastic 
words, music and arrangements.  She's got a very deep voice and a
tragically limited range but she makes the most of what she has
and I like her a lot.  Her most recent album was a bit
dissapointing but even it has enough tracks to recommend it if 
you should really like the first two.

             Learning all my holy moves doing some research               
             Which lead me to a cash box labeled 'Children's Fund'        
             I'd leave the change and tuck the bills inside my cummerbund"
