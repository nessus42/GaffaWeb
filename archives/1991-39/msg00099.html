Hi!

&gt;&gt;(Stuff I said about Enigma)
&gt;&gt; (The above are, of course, allegations...) 
&gt; 
&gt; And nothing *but* allegations until you back them up, Meredith.  Which
&gt; I really doubt you can.

I didn't bother to drop the equivalent of $5 each on the two German music 
magazines I read reports of the pending lawsuit in, but I read them in World 
Of Music in Munich's Marienplatz in early May.  Klaus Kluge or another German 
Love-Hound may be willing to try to find these and send me photocopies of the 
snippets to pass along to you, though it would be a heluva lot of work and time
to find them.

I also heard a report on 93.3 Radio Xanadu within a week of reading the
aforementioned magazines about the lawsuit, which I didn't manage to get on
tape.  Since I've left Germany I haven't heard any more about the case, which
makes sense, as Enigma was HUGE in Europe and the whole suit was treated as a
German/Munich matter.

&gt; (If there were any justice in the world you'd get taken to task for this

Well, Lazlo, you just did, didn't you?  :)

&gt; post even more seriously than Robin did for her "Kate Isn't Touring" post
&gt; -- IMHO it's a lot more serious to accuse an artist of plagarising than it
&gt; is to say they've cancelled their concert plans.) 

Hey- *I* didn't accuse them of plagiarizing, the Munich consort did. 
Unfortunately I've been unable to get further details on the case, and as a
matter of fact I don't care which way it goes.  I just thought it would be a
little item of interest for lurking Enigma fans out there.
