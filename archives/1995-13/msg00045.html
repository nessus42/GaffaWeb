:"THE RED SHOES" PROMO BOX
: 
:Sure to form part of any future rarities listing is the promotional
:shoebox designed to whet critics' appetites for Kate Bush's lastest
:album.
:This 1,000-only collectible, which is shoebox shaped (size 4-and-a-
:half, of course, as per Kate's feet), is still being manifactured
:as we go to press, but word has it that it will include a special
:fountain pen; a video, which will probably feature the "Rubberband
:Girl" excerpt from the "The Red Shoes"  film, A CD of the album;
:and a biography printed on parchment paper, neatly tied with red
:ribbon.
:-------------------------

My ex- bought a second-hand version of this for A$50, but it was missing 
the fountain pen, so no really great bargain.  The video however was 
interesting, in that it was marked as an EMI-Australia item - so some of
these must have come out at the local level.  The video is not very long,
and only contains (long) excerpts from each of the pertinent videos, not
the whole thing.  From memory, it has Rubberband Girl (UK version? - from
the film), Moments of Pleasure (Aspel version - shortest excerpt) and
Rubberband Girl (US version? - this has Kate as Rock Goddess looking tres 
cool, in fact better than she has looked for a long time, with some really
lovely images, like the flashes of Kate-standing-there-with-long-straight-
hair-and-not-much-else-in-negative one).

That's all I can remember of it - the last video excerpt was the closest 
being complete.  I've never seen it on television either in the States or
in Australia.

Enjoy,
-Shaun
