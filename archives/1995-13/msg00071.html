Hi,
 
&lt;James Hogan &lt;James@absfabs.demon.co.uk&gt;&gt; writes:
&gt; Jelle from NL (Congratulations on your english, I was impressed).
&gt; said that a magazine article mis-titled "Army Dreamers"  - "I'm
&gt; a genius", but he didn't understand why, because they didn't
&gt; sound the same to him. All I can say Jelle is the "I'm a genius"
&gt; does sound a bit like "Army Dreamers" but I wonder what they made
&gt; of "what a waste of" !
 
Does make you wonder, doesn't it? Well, what Jelle probably didn't
know, was that Popfoto, the Dutch magazine we're talking about in
this case actually provided the lyrics to this unreleased demo
version in a later issue. I was surprise you people at Love-Hounds
didn't know about this early version of "Army dreamers", and
assumed you already knew the lyrics, which is why I didn't mail
them earlier. (I should've known: it wasn't included in "The Garden"
either. IED? You can include it now!)
 
So now, for your reading pleasure, the words of "I'm a genius", a
Dutch exclusive!....
 
*********************
 
I'M A GENIUS
 
Flour kissing mommy's boy
Scorning hope for me and Cleo
I've had lunch with subtle cowards
to evaporate my mammal's zero
Morning for the error-prone
The weather, mom, is getting colder
Four men in uniform they carry home a naked soldier
 
(Woop-doo-de-doo should he be a mock-larva)
But he didn't flap his wings before a cheetah
(Woop-doo-de-doo shoot him with a politician)
But they didn't have my sort of education
(Woop-doo-de-doo shouldn't there be a party)
But we didn't even buy a set of panty's
What are we?
 
So I'm a genius
Poolwater's wasted
I'm a genius
 
Tears are on ten clocks
Cuba crises wanted too, no
Lick a chick and with a fax
a carrot sent to a warbled new Pope
Give the chick a pick of fixes
and give her all your sticks and syringes
Mommy's sitting in his home
Her wage is low, how low do momma's go
 
(Woop-doo-de-doo should he be a mock-larva)
But he didn't flap his wings before a cheetah
(Woop-doo-de-doo shoot him with a politician)
But they didn't have my sort of education
(Woop-doo-de-doo shouldn't there be a party)
But we didn't even buy a set of panty's
What are we?
 
So I'm a genius
Poolwater's wasted
I'm a genius
Ooh what a wish I want and
I'm a genius
I'm a genius
I'm a genius too
 
(I'm a genius)
(I'm a genius)
(No warm veal-roast)
(I'm a genius)
(No warm veal-roast)
