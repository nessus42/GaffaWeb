Hi,

Last Saturday I went to a cd and Lp fair in Nijmegen.
I bought a pile of interviews and photo's of Kate from Dutch, English en 
German music magazines en from some Dutch TV/radio guides. There also was a 
picture of Kate performing, with behind her the drums with had the text 
     The
   KT Bush
    Band
on it. This picture had an A4 format. The same picture wich was 3 by 5 cm had 
the following text next to it " The KT Bush Band starring the 19-years-old 
Kate Bush, appearing at the Rose of Lee in Lewisham, in 1977. She's already 
signed to EMI in 1974." Then under the text is written " Q 10/'90 " I think 
this means that the picture is from Q-magazine number 10 published in the 
year 1990

I just wanted to report this because somebody on this mailing-list once said 
that this picture was on the cover of a bootleg and somebody else responded 
that he/she didn't even knew that this picture existed. Well it does and I 
have it  :-(JIPPIE;-) Sorry.

In one of the interviews from a Dutch magazine Kate talked about Army 
Dreamers, although in the interview it's called  " I'm a genius " 
(??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????)
She says that the song is about the mother who sent her son to the army 
because every mother in the neighbourhood does it and that she doesn't really 
know her son. He has dreams of becoming a musician or a politician and she 
doesn't even know it. So basicly it's about the generation gap between the 
son and the mother.
When I read this I was very surprised because I never read this explanation 
before. Also it's strange that the song is called " I'm a genius' I mean it 
doesn't sound or looks like Army Dreamers at all. I think that's very weird.  
          
Well, this is the end of my first posting, I hope you liked reading it and 
please be kind to my mistakes :-)      

Bye,
Jelle
