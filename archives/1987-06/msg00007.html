	Someone told me he had heard a rumor that within the
next few years the major labels are planning to phase out
all vinyl releases in favor of CD's [C'Disease?], which could
conceivably widen the gap between underground and above-ground
music (for lack of better terms). A frightening thought, not
that I care much about major labels, but still... Kind of analagous
to the bifurcation that seems to have developed amongst this group,
with hostilities flying between two distinct camps, etc. Hmmm.. 
	So, Forced Exposure is having a "benefit" here in Boston
sometime in April, featuring Tesco, Lydia "I still don't understand why
someone isn't right there ready to exploit what I'm willing to exploit"
Lunch, Thurston, Albwini, and other names. Don't know what they're gonna DO,
but should be innarestin'..

	Speaking of which, after reading that brilliant piece from FE,
where the dude from Peach of Immoratality makes fun of that, uh "tepid
cup o' sub-sub-PURE drool like B'g  Black's "Jrdn, MN"'s genuinely
fuckin' pathetic, Prostate tickled NOT. Th' trick f'r me's t'...t'
..FUCK!" minimal style of 'zine writing -  I naturally predicted their 
album ""Johovah" My Black Ass - REM is Air Supply!" to be worthwhile. But 
turned out to be 50+ of continuous noise. Did I miss something?
	
	The 6-song disk by Gray Matter should definitely qualify as a
great record of '86. Try to find a copy in blood-red vinyl. Dischord's
been hot lately - picked up the lp by Rites of Spring which is fairly
killer (how does this label survive selling albums for $5 ppd??) They 
sound, at least vocally, much like fellow DC area-n's [aryans?] Gray
Matter. New Scream single rocks heavily. Also from '86, try Phantom 
Tollbooth for a healthy dose of churning guitar onslaught (on Homestead). 

Enough '86 -
	new bands to watch out for:

		Breaking Circus
		Prevaricators (well, new to me anyway)
		Magnolias 

	Boston bands to watch out for:
		
		Bags
		Lemonheads
		Gingerbread Men
