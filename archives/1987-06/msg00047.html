&gt; ... underground bands ... John Zorn ... Diamanda Galas ... 

I was in the San Francisco Tower Records store when I heard some 
interesting things being played, so I went up to the counter to find 
out what it was.  There was already someone asking about it.  The 
counterman showed us the cassette box of John Zorn's the Big Gundown.  
When I asked if it was only available on cassette, the man said no, 
they had LPs available and, in fact, CDs, and they were in the Jazz 
section.  I grabbed the CD version.  The point is, I find it difficult 
to think of someone with cassette, LP and CD versions of a work 
available, that's getting play at Tower, as an "underground band."  
Unless, perhaps, you're thinking most jazz artists are "underground."  

Diamanda Galas I don't know too much about, other than having two 
albums by her.  I would not find it difficult to believe that she is 
about as "underground" as, say, Kate Bush 3 to 4 years ago, i.e., just 
not well known in this country.  Is this what you mean by underground?  

If, by underground, you mean all that which is not getting on "top 40" 
or something similar, then I would suggest Frank Zappa as meeting IED's 
criteria. 

I think it would help to define what you mean by "underground," and then 
we can find out if IED is using the (roughly) same definition.

From: IED...
&gt; ... He can only answer that
&gt;he simply has insufficient patience for messy body work,
&gt;however powerful the engine under the hood may be.

If you're looking at show car, the finish is quite important and 
you're quite right;  if you're looking at a race car, the finish 
must be good enough to not lose the race.  This comment would lead 
me to believe IED doesn't care for the early work of Bob Dylan; is 
that true?  (No big deal, but I would conclude IED has more limited 
taste than other people posting on Love-Hounds.  Is this conclusion 
correct?)
