Why don't we discuss:

             Female Artists on Independent Labels 


One thing I've noticed after a year or so of much listening to "indi" music is
this: outside of dance mersch which I avoid and thus can't comment on, if an
album has female vocals or mostly female bandmembers, chances are it's a very
good album.  The only exception I've run into is this funny 12" by Fuzzbox, an
all girl group that sounds (according to local friend) like the Bangles on 
both speed *and* LSD.  (Even then, the 12" is fun.)

I welcome any discussion of why this might be true or opposing opinions 
(hopefully in the form of a list of indi girls who make bad music).  The only
reason I can think of for why this claim might be true would be something like
an undeliberate sexist filter in the music scene on girl musicians which
weeds out the mediocre 90% of female musicians, leaving only the best for
recordings.  But this is mere speculation, what the hell do I know?  

Anyway, this is the list of female artists I listen to.  The starred (*) ones
are highly recommended.

All-Female:
*Frightwig (alternately trashy/dirgy post punk, screamin' vocals, strong 
            lyrics)
 Wilma (like Frightwig but calmer, more towards weird pop, except for the
        excellent slow hardcore-style cover of Georgy Girl.)
 The Slits (raw, damaged punk)
*Holy Sisters of the Da Da Ga Ga (creative, weird psychedelic/folk/whoknows 
                                  pop.  Interesting "cover" of Monkees and
                                  others.)
 Fuzzbox (comic relief)

Female Vocal Only Groups:
*Throwing Muses (similar to Holy Sisters but with serious tone.  4AD, so you
                 know it's probably great, and it is.)
*Cocteau Twins (Unique vocal work backed by rich, omminous guitar work.
                "Garlands" is essential listening.)
 Lydia Lunch (Morbid post punk; distinctively forlorn lyrics, bratty vocals)
 Diamanda Galas (undisputed queen of post-operatic terrorism.  Disturbing
                 lyrics, amazing vocal techniques.)
*Diana Rogerson (interesting solo work from ex Nurse With Wound member; 
                 carries on with NWW's unique style of listenable found-sound
                 collages)
*Mad Violets (happy, fun psychedelic rock)
*SS20 (intense psychedelic rock by Chrissie Hynde soundalike who is better)
 Danielle Dax (very eclectic; pretty singing.)
*Gutbank (hard rocking post punk with female lead guitarists.  How many of  
          those do you know of (outside of all-girl groups)?  3 girls 1 guy.)
 Susy &amp; Banshees (do lots of dance apparently, but also the post psych stuff
                  on "A Kiss in the Dreamhouse")
*KUKL (actually has male vocals too.  Innovative, weird post punk with lots
       of dissonance organized into a carnival-like atmosphere.)


This list isn't complete--add to it.
