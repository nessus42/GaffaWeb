<PRE>
the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head
in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to
propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of
my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God
after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was
a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans
body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines
for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt
what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him
all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and
I wouldn't answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky...

...O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious
sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer
little streets and pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens
and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl
where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair
like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he
kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as
another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then
he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put
my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my
breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I
said yes I will Yes.
