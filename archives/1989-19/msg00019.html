 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: ClarifiKation; and More KT NEWS

     To keep the record straight, IED's description of his find
yesterday was a description of the _British_ single. So far as IED
is aware the US single is not going to come out for another 9 or 10
days (October 1); and it will _not_ be _The_Sensual_World_, but a
different track: _Love_and_Anger_. No word yet on what the U.S.
single's b-side(s) will be.
     An amazing discovery: there is also (in very limited quantities,
how limited IED doesn't know, but very limited) a white-label test
pressing of the UK 12" going around swapmeets throughout the country,
and a few copies have even been advertised in _Goldmine_ this week.
This white-label is _extra-special_: on the b-side are _Walk_Straight_
_Down_the_Middle_ and the instrumental version of _TSW_. But on the
a-side, instead of the vocal version of _TSW_ there is simply another
pressing of the instrumental version again.
     OR SO ONE WOULD THINK! In fact, the a-side is _double-grooved_!
The a-side plays _both_ the instrumental and the vocal versions of
_TSW_, depending on exactly where you set the needle down!
     Looks like Katey's been up to her old tricks again!
     Newsfront: The album cover is different from the 12" cover only in
a subtle way. Instead of showing Kate with dust (or sand) running
through her fingers, she has a flower in her hand, in front of her
mouth (so that the mouth is not visible). Otherwise the photo is
very much like the 12" cover's photo--same tinted duo-tone b-and-w
style. No word on the back cover of the album, or what any interior
artwork there might be, or on the lyric sheet, if any. According to
IED's information, the U.S. promo-cassettes of the album, which are
already circulating rather widely here in the States (CBS has
sent out copies to many radio stations, and they seem to have arrived
everywhere at the same time), do _not_ contain any interior artwork,
nor do they have lyrics. Let's hope CBS doesn't skimp like that for
the official release.
     Chances are they won't. IED received a call from a radio person
who read a copy of the CBS press-kit's article for the new album. And
it is _very_ nicely written, very feelingful (though it does of course
use terms like "AOR ad repro" and "units sold"), and only minimally
incorrect from a factual point of view. Also, it details a significant
amount of promotional material that is being readied by CBS to blitz
the retail outlets with on D-Day, which is still listed as October 17
(though IED was told October 9 by a CBS rep who should know). And yes,
there _is_ going to be a U.S. CD-single! It may only be a promotional
item, and there's no word on what tracks it will contain, but it is
mentioned in the press-kit article.
