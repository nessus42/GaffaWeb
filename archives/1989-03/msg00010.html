Some background...

2JJJ-FM is a government run (ABC which is akin to the BBC) station 
broadcasting in Sydney and about to go national in Australia.
They are probably the most progressive station in Sydney, if not
the whole of Australia.  Recently they held a listeners poll, requesting
people to send in a list of their top 10 songs of all time.

This list was collated (one "vote" per appearance in a top 10) and
from this they compiled the Hot 100, which they broadcast on Sunday
March 5 of this year.

Only two of my top 10 made the list and I was pleasantly surprised by
much of the list, particularly the Australian content.  I guess being
an original listener of this station since their inception fourteen
years ago I should expect that my tastes don't quite fit the JJJ
"mainstream".  As far as I can tell most of my contemporaries have
switched to "Greatest memories, latest hits" or staight top 40
stations.

Needless to say, the list is interesting and the taste of Triple J
listeners is impeccable.  I posted this just for the general interest
of this newsgroup.  Apparently some 8,536 songs were included in the
combined lists, so the hot 100 is reasonably representative.
