&gt; From: Michael Fischer &lt;MFISCHER%SBCCVM.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu&gt;

&gt;   On a slightly similar topic... I've been meaning to ask the
&gt; Love-Hounds' bank of infinite knowledge this question that has been
&gt; bothering me for a while: What year was Pink Floyd's "Atom Heart
&gt; Mother" released? I own the CD and cannot find a date or copyright
&gt; notice anywhere. Does this mean I can copy it!?!? I don't know where
&gt; to put it in my collection (chronologically that is). Can anyone
&gt; help?

ATOM HEART MOTHER was released in 1970.  Chronilogically, Pink Floyd's
albums up to AHM go:

     PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN (1967)
     A SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS (1968)
     MORE (1969)
     UMMAGUMMA (1969)
     ATOM HEART MOTHER (1970)

&gt; From: wdh@linus.MITRE.ORG (W. Dale Hall)

&gt; Regarding the question of "when was Atom Heart Mother recorded", on
&gt; which I have no further information, I've just obtained what appears
&gt; to be an old bootleg:

&gt;
&gt;	The Screaming Abdabs:	"Rhapsody in Pink
&gt;				-- the Psychedelic Years"

&gt; The cover indicates it's from a series of BBC sessions, but there is
&gt; no date information of any sort.  The tracks include such PF
&gt; favorites as "Echoes", "Atom Heart Mother Suite", "Careful With That
&gt; Axe, Eugene", "If", and "One of These Days I'm Going to Cut You Into
&gt; Little Pieces", plus things I haven't heard on other PF albums.

I've seen this bootleg, but passed on it, because I already had all of
the recordings on other bootlegs.  "The Atom Heart Mother Suite,"
"Careful With That Axe, Eugene," and "If" are from the 1970 John Peel
session.  "Echoes" and "One of These Days" are from the 1971 John Peel
session.  The other tracks were from earlier BBC performances (most or
all of which were for John Peel as well).

&gt; On the other hand, maybe this bootleg is a re-compilation, without
&gt; redeeming historical value.  Does anyone out there have more info?

It is a compilation, of sorts, of BBC recordings.  The bootleg LIVE
1967-1969 has a more complete set of their earlier BBC performances, and
there are myriad boots of the 1970 and 1971 Peel sessions floating about.

&gt; From: claris!wombat@ames.arc.nasa.gov (Scott Lindsey)

&gt; My, but we seem to be digressing off into Pink Floyd land...  Pink
&gt; Floyd used to have this interesting habit of performing music that
&gt; they were currently working on/writing.  As a result, many a fan in
&gt; the '70's

(and, through the magic of bootlegging, in the '80s as well)

&gt; got to hear strange and unusual versions of Pink Floyd songs years,
&gt; even, before they released the album.

And often, they played material that never made it onto any
(legitimate) album.  To wit: "The Embryo," (Though it eventually
showed up on the WORKS compilation quite a few years after they
stopped playing it live, it was an unfinished studio demo that was a
pale shadow of the 1970 and 1971 concert versions.)  "Corrosion,"
"Reaction In G," "One In A Million," "Vegtable Man," "Scream Thy Last
Scream," etc.
