Cutter,

        Peter Gabriel's new album (i don't know what it's called) is scheduled
to come out in June i think. He is also going to tour after or coinciding with
the release. ...

About profanity in this list..

        This is a list about progressive music. Fact is that while a lot of
the music discussed here wouldn't be called punk, as we could see from recent
discussion, most of the participants here are familiar with groups like the
"Butthole Sufers". Trademark of progressive music &amp; punk is that it is often
trying to make a unique statement of individuality, and shock value is one
aspect of that. You may not agree that it is a very valid form of expression,
but i say profanity has its finer points. heh. ...
        Anyway, you would find that a lot of the people of the kind
who send to this file use profanity heavily in their every-day language,
and it would be only stupid pretentionism for anyone to stop doing the same
when writing to the digest. And pretentionism and other such fake behavior is
one of the prime targets of punk rock lyriks, as most of us well know. Again,
just look at the ongoing discussion about The Butthole surfers.
        So, while i myself don't tend to be overly obscene, especially when
i am writing, i would not even think of telling else anyone not to.

                                   see you on the bitstream
                                        - Ziggy Cyber
