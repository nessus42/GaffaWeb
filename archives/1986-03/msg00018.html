	Although credited as co-composer, Daryl Hall isn't the vocalist on
"Chicago". It is sung by the amazing Peter Hammil, of Van Der Graff Generator
fame, and lately of the "K" Band. Hammil and Fripp have collaborated on
several other projects (Two VDGG albums, "H to He, Who am the Only One", and
"Pawn Hearts", and a couple solo Hammil albums (I think)).
On exposure, Hammil also sings on "Disengage" and "I may not have had e..."
	Another interesting point; "Exposure" has been recently (end of
last summer) re-released in Canada with a foldout cover. The tracks are
listed as the same but there are noticeable differences in the songs.
A different vocal track is used on "Disengage", the Frippertronics
pieces are a lot longer (some by several minutes), and some of the between
track conversations have been shortened.
	As for "Exposure" being a Crimson album, I have to agree. Most of
the material was written while Crimson was still together (The Wetton/Bruford/
Cross line-up) and it sounds much more like Crimson than Fripp's later
works. (But not the `new' Crimson - the Belew infested one).

	A postscript: For those of you who really enjoy the hard-edged
material on "Exposure" and "Starless and Bible Black", and are Wayside Music
corresponders, I heartily recommend the two "Bi Kyo Ran" albums that they
are currently offering - a Japanese Crimson-cover band. Perhaps not the
most inventive music ever recorded, but the guitarist/composer is a dead
ringer for that era of Fripp.
