Many of you probably know, at least if you read net.music, that I can
enjoy a good flame every now and then.  Perhaps as pseudo-maintainer
of this list, however, I find myself more in a position of
responsibility, especially when I think of all the poor people out
there who signed up so they could hear the latest fanzine drivel on
Kate Bush, and didn't expect to get assaulted with reams on the latest
moral issues on communication techniques in a widely networked
environment.  Therefore, I declare that as of tommorrow the debate on
profranity is officially closed.  So you better get your last words in
quickly.  All flames on the matter after tomorrow will have something
very obscene done to them, but I'll not tell you what lest some
people get upset.

You guys shouldn't force me to become an evil censoring power hungry
tyrant, however, because once I've tasted that sort of power, I will
probably get cocky and start believing that I can do anything at all.
The next thing you know, I'll be off in England camping out on Kate's
front lawn until she gives me the 12" single for "Sat In Your Lap"
(which she has like the only copy of).  Either that or until she gives
*me* the  key, rather than this Houdini bloke....  And then there will
be no one left to run this mailing list.

Those who wish to continue to use profanities, may do so, but you
should realize that when it appears in mod.music, Greg Skinner may
perform some unpredictable transformation on what you have said to
make it acceptible for the likes of cmoore@brl.  Those who do not
wich to read profanities, may unsubscribe, wear their official
"Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" peril sensitive glasses, or fluck
off and die.  Or perhaps if they ask me hard enough, I might provide a
filter to transform "d*mn" into "darn", "sh*t" into "shoot", "G*d"
into "golly" and "f*ck" into "play hide the salami".  After running
Love-Hounds through this filter, it should be acceptible even to those
who find "Leave It To Beaver" too risque.

P.S.  For those who want some fanzine drivel: the last time I looked
at Billboard, sometime last week, the single "Hounds of Love" had
entered the British charts at 26, and the album had risen from 19 to
14.  On the other hand, last week the album "Hounds of Love" just
dropped out of the U.S. top 100.  There will be a moment of silence.
On the other hand, the album is still at number six on WFNX's chart.

And here's a review by Andy Gill from the 1 March 86 issue of the NME
for the HoL single:

	She'd say  I'm sure, there's always been an erotic
	undercurrent to her work, but on the "Hounds of Love" LP it's
	handled with confidence, maturity, and daring largely absent
	in her earlier work; here as in "Running Up  That Hill",
	desire is almost religious in its intensity.

Does anyone have any idea why the NME decided that after N years of
hating Kate Bush, it was suddenly okay to like her?

And about this erotic undercurrent that's always been there...  there
are some things that have been puzzling me for a while.  Like in
"L'Amour Looks Something Like You" Kate sings at the end "I find I'm
living in that evening with that feeling of sticky love inside".  What
is this feeling of sticky love inside?  She's not talking about
*seamen* is she?  Gosh.  Is the feeling of old seamen inside you
something that is fun to remember?  Perhaps some of the women on the
list would like to elaborate.

And in "Ran Tan Waltz" Kate sings "But some night she'll run back in
fright if she picks on a Dick that's too big for her pride."  I don't
get it.  Are all of the woman's extramarital boyfriends named "Dick"?
And why would they be too big for her pride?  Oh...  golly, she's not
talking about penises, is she?  Well why would a penis be too big for
the woman's pride?  I don't get it.  Could someone explain this to me.

And once in an interview, Kate was asked what her favorite songs  on
"The Dreaming" were, and for one of them, she said "Nice To Swallow".
Now, there's no "Nice To Swallow" on the album.  There's "Night Of The
Swallow", so Kate must be making a pun.  But why "Nice To Swallow"?
Oh, golly.  She's not talking about penises again, is she?!?  Or maybe
seamen again?

This reminds me of one of my friends who was in my M.I.T. dorm.  He
went to Wellsley for a semester as an exchange student.  In a biology
class there, the professor was talking about how seamen has a high
salt content.  One of the students blurted out "But it tastes so
sweet!"  and then she immediately looked very embarrassed.  Maybe
someone would like to elaborate and tell us whether or not seamen
and/or penises are nice to swallow and whether seamen is salty or
sweet.

Well, I'm pretty confused now, but at least I can rest assured tonight
that since I haven't used any profanities here, that at least *I*
haven't offended anyone today.

P.P.S.  Isn't it strange that all this talk about obscenity started in
the 69th posting to mod.music???  I think it's a message from G*d!
But what does it mean?
