&gt;But you and others assume *wrongly* that Tori is trying
&gt;to imitate Kate. She's not. She can't win with you
&gt;people. If she doesn't mention Kate she's considered
&gt;a rip-off artist who refuses to cite influences. If she
&gt;mentions how much she admires Kate then she's considered
&gt;an imitator.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;Do you people judge *all* female vocalists that way?
&gt;Hell, Sarah McLachlan sounds more like Kate than Tori
&gt;does, and she plays piano too! (so does Happy). So, why
&gt;does Tori get more venom than Sarah? I just really believe
&gt;that it's a personal problem with Tori, and y'all just
&gt;drag Kate down with your inability to realize that Tori's
&gt;an individual with her own style. If you don't like her,
&gt;there's a very simple solution: don't listen to her. If
&gt;you ignore her, you won't have to spend so much energy
&gt;on her (which is the other thing I don't understand...why
&gt;you people go on and on and on and on and on and on about
&gt;someone you don't even like. Why not go on and on and on
&gt;and on and on about someone you *do* like? Like, oh, say,
&gt;Kate, for instance.)

Hi Vickie - i don't think we've chatted before, i just wanted to drop you
(sorry i'm sending this to the list, i accidentally deleated your private
email address :(  ) a note &amp; say that i thought you presented your case
brilliantly &amp; eloquently!  now, i don't agree with all of your points
(that would be boring!  :)   )  but you made a very interesting argument -
one that i will think about the next time i have a problem with tori!  i
own Y KANT TORI READ thru UTP (havn't yet purchased BFP, been told by many
great sources i should give it a listen - "it'll grow on ya" they allways
say...)  and for the most part, i enjoy the hell out of tori - &amp; because
of your above mentioned post, i will rethink some of my views about her
over the next couple of hours (going on a 7 hour road trip &amp; thought i
might listen to some tori on the way down  :)  ).  anyway, vickie, i've
babbled on long enough - thanks for your very intelligent argument!!  

peace~
