&gt;Really-From: J. Peter Alfke &lt;alfke@csvax.caltech.edu&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Let me be the first to say that I have the compact disc of The Dreaming.
&gt;Let me also say that its sound is MAGNIFICENT.  Absolutely crystal clear.
&gt;One of the finest AAD discs I've ever heard.
&gt;I played it loud.  About the beginning of "There Goes a Tenner", as the
&gt;drum and bass notes collided in the pit of my stomach while Kate's voice
&gt;keened through my cerebrum, I realized that I'd never really *heard* the
&gt;album before.  During "The Dreaming" I began to have a religious
&gt;experience.  Yow.
&gt;So march right down to Poo Bah, corner of Walnut and Wilson in Pasadena,
&gt;California, and give them your $16.95.
&gt;I repeat, Yow.

&gt;"See the light..."
&gt;

I bought it yesterday and was reading Peter's posting as I was giving
it a second listen (I didn't want any distraKTions during the first
listening, of course :-) )  I have to second everything he says.  The
sound is beautiful... the bass drum comes through especially well on
"There Goes a Tenner" and "Suspended in Gaffa", and many of the lyrics
that were a little less than clear on vinyl are much more intelligible
now.  Yow, indeed.  (Maybe soon EVERYBODY will be talking about their
"First Time"!)

For those of you with an eye for details:  EMI Records, catalog no.
CDP 7463612 (import).  Peter got a better deal than I did; I paid $20.
(But what is $3 when you're buying a masterpiece! :-)  The man at the
store said that "the rest" of Kate's albums would be on CD shortly...
but at least in terms of EMI's import CDs, the only one that seems to
be missing is Never For Ever.  I've seen The Kick Inside, Lonheart,
The Dreaming, Hounds of Love and The Whole Story on EMI imports.
Perhaps he meant EMI America... but given the comments some Love-Hounds
have made regarding the comparative quality of EMI America's CD's, I
would be interested to hear whether the domestic CD of The Dreaming
is as good when it becomes available.
