First, about Wicinski and his verbal abusive behavior.  I, can say without
reservation that Wicinski is every bit as verbally frank in personal (thats,
in person) communication attempts.  As a matter of fact, this paragon of
smutty speech has, in my presense, subjected entire roomfulls of reasonably
articulate neuroscientists to outbursts of such proportions that, had the
remarks been made in this forum, he might have been censored from the
entire universe.  However, he is apparently alive and living in the DC area.
This says something, I'm sure.  So the man is a foulmouthed weenie, with
little respect for personal dignity, self preservation, archaic language
taboos (however, informed sources have suggested that except for his indulgence
in non primate sexual relationships, he does draw the line somewhere near
the feline end of the phylogenetic spectrum, suggesting that he probably
doesn't perform crude acts with rodents, fish or birds and, accordingly
doesn't have a real problem, anyway).  Let's not forget that to kill Wicinski
would be to kill the American Dream.  If you really need to get back at
him, lock up your cat at night.

Unlike IED, I have too little time to engage in an endless debate.  However,
I would suggest that IED first confirm that he, himself, exists before trying
to logically argue his way out of a fanatical position.

In regards to my feelings concerning being referred to as a fucking dumbbell,
I don't really have any in particular.  I realize that my reply to IED may
have sounded as though it were emotionally based, however, it was, as is
many of my postings, an intentionally rash product of a drunken stupor.  I
do hold to the basic tenets of what I said, however and I do feel that engaging
in a conversation with IED is very similar to having discussions with
religious fanatics.  In this regard, IED has coroborated the basic idea in
dismissing my last posting as an attack against his Bushian religion, when
that really wasn't the point, at all.  So, How really fucking dumb am I?
I guess that even taking the time to write this should make that clear.  As
for Bill Hsu's commandment list... I think it's a good one.  Now, I don't
really see IED as a God, but more like a Moses or Joseph Smith.  Remember
in the Bushian religion, Kate is God and IED only her humble servant who has
been sent to earth to convert as many people to acknowledging her as the
one true god.  Proof of IED's divinity will be demonstrated if he can be
directed, by whatever spirit (some angel with an Italian sounding name, or
some unearthly spectre, perhaps), to uncover the buried chest containing
the first condom ever used in a relationship with Kate, her first dildo, 
pictures of her fucking (collectively) Pink Floyd bandmembers, and that
poor excuse for a 'How to use a Fairlight, for fun and profit!!' manual
she read before trying to imitate Tomita on Never for Ever.  He will never
prove himself by demonstrating his ignorance by using dialectic to try
to examine concepts of esthetics.

P.S.  To John Jacobsen (to whom I am trying to construct a valid return EMAIL
      address which this mailer will accept) and others who send me personal
      mail.  Please keep the NSA food shit out of the communications.  It may
      well serve some importance in the real world, but remember, NUSC is
      a military institution which engages in a great deal of classified
      material.  Whereas it may be an intrusion on universities, or the
      private sector to have communications monitored, give these guys a break,
      this is a defense department network, and the government reserves the
      right to monitor for possible security problems.  I don't to sound like
      some para-military fuddyduddy (SP?), but the reason you can put the
      NSA food shit in the message is because these guys do their jobs well.
      Next time you include the line, think about the boy who cried wolf and
      what communication on an Amerikan network would be like.  How many
      Love-Hounds postings have come from behind the iron-curtain?
