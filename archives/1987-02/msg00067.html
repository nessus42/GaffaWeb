Hi, folks, this is Andrew Marvick speaking.
You haven't heard from me in Love-Hounds before,
although my name is probably familiar to you.
I'm writing to you myself because I'm a little
worried about IED. (He's the guy I post messages
for -- although, having very little interest in pop stars
myself, I rarely pay any attention to what I write for him.)
 
It seems that this morning IED disappeared. I mean,
he simply DISAPPEARED. Here's how it happened. I was
awakened this morning by the sound of IED's car door
slamming outside the house. I looked out the window
in time to see his car driving off towards Pasadena
(of all places!), and as he sped down the road I thought I
could hear him screaming something about "Poo-bah's" and "no
time to waste!" I didn't know what to make of it.
 
You know, most of the time IED just sits around in the
back yard with an old Sony D-5 and some headphones --
he's not in the habit of driving to Pasadena, I can tell you!
Aside from sitting listening to a couple of Kate Bush
albums over and over (pretty weird stuff if you ask me),
all he ever does is dictate alot of obsessive, histrionic
messages to me every day. Anyway, I thought no more of it,
but about one this afternoon he returned home, carrying
something in a brown paper bag, and slammed the door
to his ROOM behind him. (IED NEVER goes into his ROOM!)
 
I called through the door to him, asking if there
was anything wrong, and he gave a pretty strange
answer. I don't know what to make of it, but maybe
you Kate Bush fans will understand what he was
talking about. As near as I could make it out,
what he said was this:
 
"I've been out in the Garden for sixteen months,
and now I've come back into the House!"
 
Anyway, the gist of the matter is that when I opened
the door and went in to ask him what the devil he was talking
about, he was gone -- there was NOBODY IN THE ROOM.
Well, I mean to say, the twins (who are back in L.A.
for a few weeks, on holiday from their home in the
Kentish veldt) and I were more than a little put out
at this sort of behaviour, even from a weird old get like
IED. So I ask you, what are we to make of it?
 
-- Andrew Marvick
 
P.S.: Looks as though you'll have to wait a bit
for IED's next posting, so try to remember where
you and he left off in whatever your latest dumb
argument is.
