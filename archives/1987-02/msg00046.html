well, this is what we were all waiting for....
&gt;Really-From: IED0DXM@UCLAMVS
&gt;&gt;We are forced, as IED has repeatedly demonstrated, into forcing
&gt;&gt;definitions on QUALITY which are, at most, purely arbitrary.
&gt;GODDAMMIT, HOW FUCKING DUMB CAN YOU BE?!
&gt; 
&gt;IED really cannot believe that he has to point out this obvious
&gt;fact YET ANOTHER TIME for you dumbbells.

Some brave soul among us once again had the gall to suggest that poor
little andrew was involved in one of the most painfully obvious bits
of deck-stacking since Plotinus, and he isn't buying it. Of course we
are all fools, niet waar? The three-letter dweeb has said that since Kate 
Bush *is* the Platonic form of X, then all Y must be inferior because
it isn't X. After several folks point out to the poor suffering soul
that there might be a bit of blind-sided bias in there, he snaps and
starts using all those words that he was so upset at messrs. wicinski
and hofmann et. al. for. Perhaps he will soon begin advocating stuffing
rags in our mouths and lighting them.

&gt;He did NOT give arbitrary definitions of "quality". 

Certainly not. They're only arbitraty when *other* persons look at them.

&gt;He made no judgmental remarks about the VALUE or "quality" of
&gt;such properties as "sophistication", "refinement" and
&gt;"complexity" AT ALL.

No way. That might involve a little engagement and some linguistic
skirmishing. You weren't around for that stuff last time. Trust me,
Doug did a far more elegant job of trying to argue a similar position
and it didn't work. It is simply impossible to avoid those judgemental
remarks, andrew. Can't be done. Doug has seemingly come to see the
value in entertaining the kinds of arguments all those persons you've
decided are dumb were making (whether or not he has come to agree is
another matter, of course. ;-) ).
