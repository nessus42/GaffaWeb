<PRE>
On Wednesday Jan. 28 on Much Music (the Canadian answer to MTV) there was a
Kate Bush spotlight which highlighted 6 of her videos and a few snatches of
an interview that VJ Christopher Ward conducted with her in the Much Music
studio in Toronto. The following is what transpired:

KB: I can actually say I'm happy with some of the things we did in it. It's
    one of those things that when you make a video, quite often the song isn't
    lending itself to the kind of visual ideas that you'd like it to, and with
    Breathing I think it had such a strong story that it was easier for us to
    visualize something that we felt was powerful.

CW: The song sounds like it was built on visual ideas to begin with, to some
    extent.

KB: I think when I'm writing songs I do have quite strong visual ideas but
    they're not necessarily video vidual ideas if you know what I mean. I
    think in order to get to a place or to consider yourself in someone else's
    position you try to imagine an environment and I thinkk in some ways you
    think quite visually about that.


Video: Breathing

Video: Sat in Your Lap


CW: You suffered a fate in the early going of your career of being somewhat of
    a pinup girl in the British pop mags. How did you deal with that? 

KB: I think what worried me was that it was going to stop people taking my 
    music seriously. I always find it very complimentary of people who say that
    they find me attractive and my worry is really that it would get in the way
    of my music. It's not that I find that so much of a problem as people
    wouldn't accept my music, but I don't think that that has been a problem, I
    think people do seem to accept my music for its sake.


Video: The Dreaming

Video: Running Up That Hill

Video: Cloudbusting

Video: Experiment IV



Needless to say, I was quite excited to find out that this spotlight was going
to take place. I planned for it for a whole month! I have a copy on video (not
in stereo unfortunately) and anyone that wishes a copy can send me a tape. 

Also, maybe Love-Hounds can help me. I'm compiling lyric sheets for Kates music
and I'm having trouble with The Dreaming (the song itself). If you have the
lyrics for this I would appreciate it if you would post it.

And one more thing... does anyone know an official (semi-official, rumored...)
release date for the upcoming KB studio album. Much Music said that it would be
early this year but I havn't been able to get any confirmation on that. Oh, and
does anyone know what the proposed album title is? Please post...


Later
     Derek
