Question:
  I was in my local NYC Tower records this  weekend  when  a  man
came up to me holding the tapes for both The Whole Story and HOL.
Somehow I must ooze the fact that I am a KB fan  because he asked
me which one he should  purchase. He had never bought anything by
her before, and actually,  had  only  recently  heard  of  her.  I
explained  the  advantages  of  each  (for example that The Whole
Story will give him an overall picture while HOL  is  a  complete
concept  the  way Kate intended it, blah blah blah).  Actually, I
recommended The Kick Inside for personal  reasons  (I  heard  the
album  when it was first released, bought it immediately and have
liked her ever since) but he was not convinced. I think he  ended
up  with  HOL  because  his  friend  got sick of listening to him
decide and just grabbed one....but I'd like to know what you fans
would have suggested. Who knows? This could happen again to you.

The vegetarian duet with Lene Lovich and Nina Hagen ("Don't  Kill
the Animals") is really pathetic. I also think that the new Psych
Fur singles I have heard are a bore. But I do think that the Stranglers
new one (Waiting for the Buddha??) is ok.

And for he who asked, I do know that Husker Du will be in New York
on Feb. 19th but don't yet know the rest of their tour dates. Is
Colourfield really touring in the U.S.?

What does everyone think about The Cure's decision regarding Killing
an Arab?
