	or things you can't find on CD

The FUNSEEKERS - great second vinyl from a band 
that sounds like Robyn Hitckock for all the
hype SHOULD sound like but alas, they are 
Americans and you can't expect the hordes of
college wavos to accept anything w/o an accent,
right?  right.  Shitty 60's garage punk liner
notes,tho'  and second shittiest cover since AMQA's
"Cat's Are Great"... Susstone, POB 6425, Minn,
MN 55406. (speakin' of Robyn, he's on the cover
of CREEM this month).


The SWANKYS "Best of 2"  All of my skinhead pals
do agree:  "This does rock, dude"  More of the
Jap Glam Punk Metal 'specially aimed towards
America.  Anyone hear of this "City Rocker's"
film these guys appeared in ?  Available through
Systematic for (gasp) 7$ (the yen exchange rate
is obscene).  Also available from Systematic 
is the "Fledgling Punx" compilation - another
expensive 7" of Japcore that will blow raw, little
red holes in your head until your brain is
as porous as IED's.


Notes:

POISON IDEA's "Pick Your King" EP went into it's
third pressing last year - this one is all blue
vinyl and is a classic if you missed it before;
these dudes pull off a boss speedmetal (b'fore
it was the thing to do) with lotsa killer g'tar
hooks and about 16 songs crammed on this little
disk.  Fave is the anti-reggae song.  Anyone 
wanna push for a fourth pressing, write Subcore
(address elsewhere).... ... ... Another band
you may have missed is THE PREVARICATORS - their
french import 7" EP, "Jihad" is also available
through Subcore.  Chunky punk from a detention
school band.... ... THE FLOORLORDS 7" firkin'
rocks and rolls and grooves and and and - "Black
Ice Ride 2-Nite" has been subject to repeat
plays in my crib cuz it does everything CARGO
CULT never did due to arty pretensions and gets
down like BEEFEATER could never do on vinyl (but
generally pulled offlive) mixing the post-hardcore
with lotsa funk  - features ex-DOA drummer
and Flipside award winner, Chuck Bisquits
(also Cargo Cult)  (Squirtdown, POB 7761, San 
Diego, CA, 92107 or Systematic)... ... ... 
BLATENT DISSENT ask "Is There Fear?"  and I 
reply yes, I fear that they will actually be
putting out an LP - avoid this 7" (again through
SYSTEMATIC or write the BIG YEAH, (312)-971-
2089 - ask for Mike's Mom)... ... ... Oh shit,
more of the R.E.M. greasewagon with this BOLL
WEEVILS who wanna typlify that "Austin" sound
but sound like anyother CMJish expectation of
American rock( try Systematic).  Almost but
not quite as bad as DREAM SO REAL... ... Oh gee,
A STATE OF MIND churn out humourless buttercore
about a very weighty issue - washing your hands
after taking a wiz or jacking off.  They respect
human life, y'see, so much and can't stand the 
thought of getting AIDS from doorknobs.  This 
depressing record reminds us of the constant 
threat of AIDS over a bleak English (Joy Division)
horizon even though this is from San FRan Disco.
Lotsa pics of welts and sores and some exclusive
shots of Rock Hudson's withered cock.  See the
extensive report in BRAVEAR and pay no more than
$1.50 to Julien Beck, POB 421304, S.F. CA 94142...
Stop Soiled Hands in our lifetime!... ... ...
sorry dudes, but I ain't really grooving on 
Hazil ADkins - sure he's got the proper attitude
(doesn't do interviews) but it's sorta novelty
and not anything I can really totally relate
too (except for maybe the horniness) write Norton,
POB 646, NY NY, 10003 for details.... ... ...




BEST PUNK RECORD OF THE YEAR, "KILL LOU GUZZO"
THIS MIXES A RADIO ADDRESS BY THE GUY WHO GENERATED
ENOUGH CLAMOR IN SEATTLE TO CLOSE DOWN PUNK VENUES
ALL AROUND THE CITY AND DECIMATE THE LEGIT SCENE
(TO AN EXTENT, THE MOST THRIVING POWERFUL MUSIC
COMES FROM THE MOST REPRESSED AREAS).  I FOUND
THE SONG KILLER, RECORDED WELL BUT VERY SARCASTIC
IN THE LYRICS BUT GUZZO'S LAYWERS TAKE THEM VERY
SERIOUSLY AND ARE DOING LEGAL SHIT TO SUBCORE 
WHO ARE STILL SELLING THESE BABIES FOR 2$.  SOUNDS
ALOT LIKE FLIPPER (the title cut) BUT THE REST
FALLS INTO THE PAINT BY NUMBERS SET.  BUT WHO
CARES, IT'S ONLY 2 bucks, WANKERS...THIS
IS GREAT!  BUY ALL THESE RECORDS UNTIL LOU
GUZZO QUITS AND WRITE LETTERS TO LOU'S STATION,
KIRO, SEATTLE, WA ASKING THEM TO FIRE HIM... ... ... 

Write Subcore records at POB 99284, Seattle, WA 98199
