sessions) is also available on the 7" of "Grass", for those interested in
purchasing it in the most economical manner.  The 12" includes one other
non-LP track though, "Extrovert", which is well worth having if you are
a fan.  If not, you might save a couple o' bucks.
     The next single from the LP will be "The Meeting Place", the 12" of
which will have 4 non-LP b-sides according to reliable sources.  They are
slated to be "Terrorism", "Let's Make A Den", "Find The Fox", and
"The Troubles (Will Soon Be Over)".  "The Troubles" was written around
the time of the last LP, and is about the situation in Norther Ireland.
Given the quality of "Dear God" and "Extrovert", I fully expect these
new tracks to be as good or better than anything on 'Skylarking'.  Apparently
about three albums worth of songs were written for the LP, with those
making the final cut being chosen largely for how well they fit in with
the Runt's concept of "the seasons".  This decision meant, among other
things, the dropping of all overtly political songs from the LP, including
the previously mentioned "Dear God".  "The Meeting Place" was originally
scheduled for release on Jan 5 in the UK, but the announcement was put
down to 'Seasonal High Spirits' by Virgin.  It should be out "real soon
now" though...

**P.s.  CD lovers note : The CD of The Housemartins' debut LP contains
  4 extra tracks.  Two are taken from the EP's, two are unavailable
  anywhere else to my knowledge, including a version of "He Ain't Heavy,
  He's My Brother".  I already have it on vinyl, but if you don't, or
  are a fanatic, you migh consider buying the little silver thingey.
