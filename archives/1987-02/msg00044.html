&gt;&gt; And across the breadth of their work (and Eno's is far broader than
&gt;&gt; Kate's) the quality of Eno is consistently better, more crafted and
&gt;&gt; interesting.

&gt;&gt; Rob Stanzel UUCP: ...{decvax!wanginst, mit-eddie}!apollo!rps

&gt; C'mon now, Rob.  This is ubsurd!  Eno's work consistently more
&gt; crafted than Kate's???  NO ONE's work is more crafted than Kate's
&gt; (except maybe Boston's, which shows that some being crafted doesn't
&gt; necessarily result in something worthwhile, but in Kate's case it
&gt; certainly does).  Some of Eno's work is almost completely UNCRAFTED,
&gt; he sets up a system and then lets it run with the tape recorder
&gt; going.

&gt; Now back to opinion, personally, I think that Eno is a brilliant
&gt; producer and that some of his own work is brilliant, but much of it
&gt; is boring muzak.  His best album is "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts",
&gt; which owes just as much credit to David Byrne.
&gt;			|&gt;oug

	Well, I'm willing to let large numbers of people babble over
Kate Bush, but I won't stand here and let my idol be trod upon!  Eno
is a MASTER CRAFTSMAN.  The problem with most people is that they fail
to understand the minute subtleties which define his work.  It may
sound boring to you because you can't hear the subtle changes in
timbre, or the seemingly unintentional fluttering of the master tape
on "The Final Sunset", or how the wordplay of "The Jezebel Spirit" is
contrapuntally organised such that the spoken phrases bounce off the
polyrhythmic structure of the music.  It takes a lot of careful
listening to detect this sort of craftsmanship.  The man SINGLE-
HANDEDLY introduced the rebirth of Minimalism in today's music.
	I won't bother to comment on who is more boring.  It's like saying
chocolate is much better than vanilla.
