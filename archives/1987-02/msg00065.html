I got Lionheart on CD the other day.  Wow, really disappointing after
The Kick Inside.  What happened anyway?  Reasonably good production,
but the song-writing (both music and lyrics) aches.  As trapped in the
seventies as HoL is in the eighties.

|&gt;oug, if you're serious about The Dreaming on CD, is it on import or
domestic?

Ko Tex


[ *Lionheart* is widely recognized as being Kate Bush's least
  wonderful album.  The record company forced Kate to rush it out
  shortly after the huge success of *The Kick Inside*.  Because of
  this, few new songs were written for the album.  Most of them are
  songs that Kate had lying around.  (She had written more than 200
  songs before recording *The Kick Inside*.)

  I disagree with you, however, that anything is wrong with the
  songwriting.  It is in fact the production which mars the album.
  The songwriting is in several respects more adventuresome on
  *Lionheart* than on *The Kick Inside*.  Despite its flaws,
  *Lionheart* has some absolutely brilliant songs on it: "In Search of
  Peter Pan", "Oh England My Lionheart", "Symphony in Blue", "In The
  Warm Room", and "Kashka From Bagdad".

  Reagrading *The Dreaming* on CD, I believe that it is available as
  both an import and domestic.  I do not know at this point whether
  or not the domestic is just a repackaging of the import.  This seems
  most likely to me.
