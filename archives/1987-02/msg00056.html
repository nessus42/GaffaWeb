For those who have requested a re-posting of the "discography", here
is an updated edition. Note that this is not, nor was it ever, a
real discography, but simply a list of every snippet of NON-LP KT music
known (by IED) to exist. Recordings are listed in ROUGH
chronological order.
A real discography, including all foreign pressings
with their catalogue numbers, cannot really be done --
how could one ever be really certain he had not overlooked one
of the early EMI-India pressings, for example? If there's one thing
IED has learned in his nine years (next month!) of Kate Bush
fanaticism, it is that no-one can ever hope to have a "complete"
collection.
 
"Maybe": one of Kate's earliest recordings with the KT Bush Band,
         made (as far as is known) in the summer of 1973, when
         Kate had just turned fifteen; she played about two verses
         and one chorus of the tape once during a British radio
         interview.
"Passing Through Air": One of the b-sides to the "Army Dreamers"
         single, it was recorded in 1973, at "Dave (Gilmour)'s house".
"The Man with the Child in His Eyes" (with spoken introduction): the
         only distinction of this original UK single mix is a strange
         spoken introduction in which Kate repeats the words "He's here!"
"On Stage": a four-track EP of live performances from the Tour of Life,
         featuring "Them Heavy People", "Don't Put Your Foot on the
         Heartbrake","L'Amour Looks Something Like You", and a long
         version of "James and the Cold Gun".
"Live at the Hammersmith Odeon": the official video release, including
         performances of twelve songs from the Tour of Life.
         There are a few interesting musical changes from the LP
         versions, notably the long instrumental introduction to
         "Kite" and the early version of "Violin" (with non-LP lyrics).
"Kate Bush -- On Tour": a German/Dutch TV documentary featuring footage
         of performances from the Tour of Life that were never officially
         released.
"Wow!": one of the bootleg albums (this one a 2-LP set) put out by
         an American outfit; it includes a transfer onto vinyl of the
         "Hammersmith" video's audio track, and another vinyl transfer
         of the audio portion of Kate's 1979 UK Christmas television
         special (both of which were re-released as part of the recent
         "Kate Bush Live in Europe '79-'80" bootleg 3-LP set.)
         (Also, nine tracks from "Hammersmith" turned up as a third
         bootleg LP called "A Bird in the Hand").
"Live in Paris '79": yet another bootleg by the same New Yorkers,
         this record features part of a live performance apparently
         done in Paris, and includes interesting versions of a few
         LP tracks. This record was also included as the third LP
         in the recent "Live in Europe '79-'80" bootleg set mentioned
         above. It is falsely identified as being a production of the
         non-existent "Fan Club of Taiwan".
"Kate Bush": the only title of a UK bootleg audio-cassette which
         includes virtually the entire two hours of performance from
         a 1979 concert in Bristol, England. This tape features
         chants, readings by John Carder Bush, and incidental music,
         all of which was heard in between Kate's songs
         during the concert. There are two strange ethnic chants;
         two synthesizer introductions to songs; two readings by
         John -- one known as "Two in One Coffin" (preceding
         "The Kick Inside"), the other a passage of unidentified prose
         (probably by John) about children, which precedes "In Search of
         Peter Pan";  and a long jam session by the KT Bush Band. Also
         included is the alternate (live) version of "Egypt", which
         sounds very different from the LP version.
"Kate": This was a forty-eight minute television special which aired
         in England at about the time of the Tour of Life.
         In addition to a couple of lip-synchs of LP tracks and one
         or two new vocal performances of old songs, several new and
         unique bits of music appeared on this show. They include
         a brief introduction, a performance of part of Satie's
         1st "Gymnopedie" (as an introduction to "Symphony in Blue"),
         an early version of "December Will Be Magic Again",
         a choral introduction for Peter Gabriel (Kate's
         guest on the show), a brief bit of blues piano, and a
         duet with Peter of Roy Harper's song, "Another Day".
"Let It Be": a live performance of the Beatles song, sung by
         Steve Harley, Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush during a one-off
         London benefit concert. This appeared in a very limited
         edition red plastic flexi-disc, made officially by the
         Kate Bush Club for the Japanese branch of the Club;
         in addition to the song, it includes a brief spoken
         message from John Carder Bush and Kate.
"Kashka From Baghdad": a live solo performance done on a British
         television show called "Ask Aspel" in early 1979.
"The Wedding List": a live performance done during the Prince's
         Trust Concert a few years ago; Kate is backed by Phil
         Collins on drums, Pete Townsend and Midge Ure on guitars
         and BVs, and Mick Karn on bass.
"The Empty Bullring": the b-side to the "Breathing" single.
"Ran Tan Waltz": the b-side to the "Babooshka" single.
"Army Dreamers" (single mix): does not fade out, as it does on the LP.
"December Will Be Magic Again": the 1981 Christmas single; this
         song was written much earlier, and was performed on European
         television ca. 1979/80 in an arrangement featuring bongos.
"Warm and Soothing": the b-side of the "December Will Be Magic Again"
         single.
"Sing, Children, Sing": a benefit single by Leslie Duncan, with
         Kate (virtually indistinguishable) singing in the all-star
         back-up chorus.
"You (The Game, Part II)": a duet with Roy Harper of his song, on
         his album The Unknown Soldier.
"Flowers": a duet with Zaine Griff of his song, on his 1982 LP Figures.
         This song was a tribute to the dancer/mime/choreographer
         Lindsay Kemp, with whom Kate and Zaine had studied together
         for a time, ca. 1975/77.
"No Self-Control" and "Games Without Frontiers": two tracks from
         Peter Gabriel's third solo album, on which Kate sings
         backing vocals.
"The Magician (theme from "The Magician of Lublin"): a song from
         the film "The Magician of Lublin" starring Alan Arkin, it
         featured the music of Maurice Jarre (lyricist unidentified).
         No soundtrack was ever commercially released; consequently,
         the song is only known from the nearly unlistenable film
         print itself (dialogue blots out most of Kate's vocal).
"Sat In Your Lap" (rhythm track only): this track, isolated from
         the complete mix, was heard briefly on a British television
         documentary "Looking Good, Feeling Fit".
"Sat In Your Lap" (single mix): distinctly different in sound (especially
         rhythm and relative prominence of lead vocal track) from LP
         version.
"Lord of the Reedy River": the b-side of the "Sat In Your Lap" single;
         original song by Donovan, who sings (unidentifiably) BVs.
"Dreamtime": the b-side of the "The Dreaming" single; an instrumental
         version of "The Dreaming", very similar to the LP track only
         without the lead vocals and with a longer, different ending.
"Ne T'Enfuis Pas": originally the b-side of the "There Goes a Tenner"
         single, it was later remixed (the rhythm sound brightened
         and the lead vocal moved further up in the mix) for French
         and Canadian release as an a-side.
"Un Baiser d'Enfant": the b-side of the remixed "Ne T'Enfuis Pas",
         this is a French-language version of the Never For Ever track
         "The Infant Kiss".
"Brazil": a cover of the old popular song, not included in the Terry
         Gilliam film, but promised for inclusion in the forthcoming
         soundtrack LP.
Theme from "Castaway": a cover of the theme by Stanley Meyers from the
         Ken Russell film starring Oliver Reed. No LP release announced
         yet.
"Don't Give Up": a duet with Peter Gabriel of a song from his album So.
"The Seer": a track from Big Country's 1986 album of the same name, on
         which Kate sings backing vocals.
"The King is Dead": a track from Go West's forthcoming album, on which
         Kate sings backing vocals. (Due domestically in late February.)
"Running Up That Hill" (instrumental): identical to the LP version,
         except for the missing lead vocal track; featured on the
         twelve-inch single.
"Running Up That Hill" (re-mix): an extended re-mix of the original
         recording, featured on the twelve-inch single.
"Cloudbusting (The Organon Mix)": an extended re-mix of the original
        recording, featured on the twelve-inch single.
"Cloudbusting" (the film soundtrack): an extended version of the
         original recording, with an insert of new music.
"Hounds of Love (Alternative Hounds)": an extended re-mix of the original
         recording, with completely new vocals.
"The Big Sky (Special Single Mix)": seven-inch version of the original
         recording, with a slight remix and a different opening.
"The Big Sky (The Meteorological Mix)": an extended re-mix of the
         original recording, featured on the twelve-inch single.
"Under the Ivy": the b-side of the "Running Up That Hill" single.
"Burning Bridge": the first b-side of the "Cloudbusting" single.
"My Lagan Love": the second b-side of the "Cloudbusting" single; an
         a cappella recording of the traditional Irish folk-song.
"The Handsome Cabin Boy": the b-side of the "Hounds of Love" single;
         another traditional Irish folk-song.
"Not This Time": the b-side of the "The Big Sky" single.
"Experiment IV" (extended re-mix): featured on the twelve-inch single.
