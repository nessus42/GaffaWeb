Hi there!!


It's been a while since I contributed to Love-Hounds,
but I thought it's about time...

I'm celebrating my fifth birthday as a Love-Puppy.

It all started more than five years ago, when I found
a new friend called Marcus. We were playing roleplaying-
games like Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. He was a devoted
Kate-fan. During the years he played lots of different 
bands and artists, including Kate Bush, but never really
tried to make me listen to it. But in -92 I started to 
study computer science at the university, and got an
E-mail account. I told him about Internet and how cool I 
thought it was. He responded that Kate had a fan-club there,
and showed me a magazine that had Love-Hounds and 
rec.music.gaffa listed.  I subscribed, and started to 
print out the digests on the university's matrix-printer
in order to take it with me to Marcus.
Eventually I ended up reading them too.

Back then, a huge flame-war was raging between a couple
of Love-Hounds, making up at least half of the messages, or
even more. In the introduction to the Computer-Science-course
we were told to take special care in observing the Nettiquette,
and that made me hesitate to join the fray. Besides, I was
accessing the Internet via a simple VT-100 terminal, and
composed my mail in Emacs...

By that time I started to get curious about Kate Bush.
Who was that woman, who made wiered, yet sometimes "mainstream" 
music? Marcus played albums and slowly my Kate-awareness 
came to life. 

I don't recall the first Kate song I ever heared, but I do 
remember saying to Marcus "This is cool, what is it?" and 
he'd respond "That's Kate...". I asked him several times, 
about several songs, and he'd always answer politly and 
patiently even though I now realise that I've must have
asked about the same song more than a dozen times. 
Them Heavy People, Strange Phenomena, Fullhouse, 
Hammer Horror, Delius, and Egypt were a few of the first ones
I learned to Love. I thought Coffee Homeground was wierd, 
but cool at the same time. Reminded me of some singer I 
heard in an old WW2 movie.

Marcus told me the story about the drowning woman in 
The Ninth Wave, and I was stuck. It's still the Number One
Kate Bush album, and it will always be. Then you may think
The Dreaming is my second best favourite... Not really.
I have a hard time ranking the other albums. I really 
like Lionheart, even more than The Kick inside. I took 
some time for me before I started to like Never For Ever,
but it grows steadily. I think I'll rank The Sensual World
last.

During my years as a Love-Hound I've read and learned 
great many things. I am happy to have been able to 
contribute to the list, though most of it were old
news... 
I thought the discovery of the Dreaming-Plug (tm) was 
utterly cool, but I was neither fast nor coherent enough 
in my postings to really contribute to that one. 
Big thanks to Vickie for sharing her experience that led to it.

I got a new job, and moved to a new town January -95 and
lost connection for half a year, but in June -95 I got
a modem for my PC. I've saved every Digest since then 
with only a few exeptions. 
I can now gladly announce that Love-Hounds and rec.music.gaffa 
have during the last two years produced 14 Megabytes of mail.  


My favourite Kate songs:
The Big Sky (meteorological mix)
Hammer Horror
Under Ice 
Waking the Witch


My least liked songs:
Moments of Pleasure
Houdini


Many people have written that they don't like
Why Should I Love You, but I myself like it.


Well, take care, all of you. I hope I'll
get time to write more often than before.

Music is like vintage wine. It keeps getting better over the years, 
if those who made it knew how to make it right...
