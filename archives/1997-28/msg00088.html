I can't say Never Be Mine is her best song, but it does have a very special
place to me
"Their setting fire to the cornfields as you're taking me home" is a scene
that I think would be perfect for a movie, especially considering the very
dramatic images I've seen after harvest in Illinois where there is a lot of
burning (reminds my especially of sunset in this situation). I've even
centered part of a story I've written around that sensation, the time I got
to witness this was a few years ago. I was on my way up to my sister's
farm. Coming north from Florida means a drastic climate change that
reminded me that it was Autumn. Something about that first evening that
feels like autumn...I dunno, it effects me deeply.

Ok, I know that wasn't the question that was asked, and I wasn't the person
it was directed at, but there it is.

I need to go take my medicine anyway

&gt; &gt; &gt;I have a question that I hope someone may be able to answer; on 'The
&gt; &gt; Red
&gt; &gt; &gt;Shoes' the song 'Lily' seems to be referring to something to do with
&gt; &gt; white
&gt; &gt; &gt;magic, particularly 'Gaberiel before me etc.'  (although I may be
&gt; &gt; wrong on
&gt; &gt; &gt;this) does anybody out there have any interpretations on this song
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt;what it's about, because I'd love to hear them:.)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "Gabriel before me
&gt; &gt;  Raphael behind me
&gt; &gt;  Michael to my right,
&gt; &gt;  Uriel to my left side
&gt; &gt;  In this circle of fire."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There are the archangels arranged around me in a circle of burning
&gt; &gt; fire.
&gt; &gt; Erm, one may detect the form of a protection spell here which is
&gt; &gt; quite common. 4 directions (of the sky and/or the earth) bound
&gt; &gt; with a circle, oneself inside the circle.
&gt; &gt; There are really a lot spells of this kind in various forms
&gt; &gt; (I once heard the form "Jesus to my head, Jesus to my feet, Jesus
&gt; &gt; inside me"), which are not all "christianised". One can easily
&gt; &gt; replace christian figures with others.
&gt; &gt; To become more detailed, each direction has a meaning, variing on
&gt; &gt; the cultural context. "Michael to my right" has surely something
&gt; &gt; to do with the sword/weapon bearing hand &amp;c.
&gt; &gt; I tend to call these spells "mantras", as they have the same
&gt; &gt; intention.
&gt; &gt; Best wishes,
&gt; &gt; Andreas.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;Many thanks

&gt; ...If "ever Be Mine" is her best song ever, what is your interpretation
&gt; of it? Ad with so many others, I', curious about its meaning. My guess
&gt; would be something like the breakup of an Iowa farm family (a
&gt; not-uncommon occurrence). And , of course, it could happen in many other
&gt; places as well.
