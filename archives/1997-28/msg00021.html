&gt; 
&gt;    Was she referring to Kate? Or are you an artist?
&gt; 
Kate.  Most definitely.  I would hardly be accused of being an artist.

&gt;    Actually I rarely expect anyone else to "get" Kate. I discovered
&gt; her music in 1979 on Saturday Night Live. All the other people I knew
&gt; who saw it just thought she was "weird"; some thought she was drunk.
&gt; I, in the other hand, *had* to go out to get her album the very next
&gt; day. So I never expected anyone else to understand. I found my 
&gt; girlfriend Vickie (we've been together for 15 years) via an ad
&gt; in a music paper trying to locate other Kate fans.
&gt; 
SNL was my first exposure to Kate also.  If I remember correctly, she did
two songs: Them Heavy People and .... (I don't remember the other one). 
Eric Idle was the guest host I think. Funny thing is, I have never seen
that particular program again.  Comedy Central show SNL reruns to death,
but never that one. 

&gt; &gt;Ken
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;P.S. Over in alt.music.pink-floyd they were having a discussion about
&gt; &gt;whether Kate and Dave Gilmour had/are having an affair.  Some of you
want
&gt; &gt;to go straighten those heathens out?
&gt; 
&gt;    I'm aware of the discussion (I have a service that mails me every
&gt; post where the words "Kate" and "Bush" appear together). As they refer
&gt; to Guilmor as "...that fat bastard" I didn't relish jumping in.
&gt;
I have stopped going to a.m.p-f.  Half the people there are Roger Waters
fans who do nothing but put down Gilmour and his music.  "That fat bastard"
was pretty mild compared to the usual fare.
 
&gt;    It's not true, BTW. It's a sexist assumption by people unable to
&gt; imagine that any woman could succeed solely on her talents.
&gt; 
Possibly, but in this case I think it was more a case of Dave Gilmour
haters roiling the waters, so to speak.
