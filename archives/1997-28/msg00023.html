&gt;    Kate music with cheezy synths overdubbed? Speeds
&gt; changed? Random quotes overdubbed?
&gt; 
&gt;    Selling one thing under the pretense of selling
&gt; something else is another type of stealing.
&gt; 
...### Granted, but there's something else people may be overlooking
here. Lots of people may like the "cheesy synths overdubbed". There's a
lot of popular stuff around that's even cheesier, as we all know.

&gt; &gt;I 've been looking for a long time for these songs
&gt; &gt;that are included in this CD and Mark was the only
&gt; &gt;one that offered me the chance to have them and
&gt; &gt;I don't see anything wrong in paying for something
&gt; &gt;that you want .
&gt; 
The person Kate is now may not like the songs, but the person Kate
&gt; was at the time of "The Whole Story" decided to re-record
&gt; the vocals on "Wuthering Heights". Does this make the
&gt; original vocal "bad"?

##### No, but the rec-recorded vocal on "Wuthering Heights" was very
skillfully and tastefully done. (Yell if you disagree, but I don't
expect many to do so.)

...
&gt;    As for making copies? Please volunteer! The people who
&gt; made the Love-Hounds Collection and Kateopia videotapes
&gt; didn't have any special magical powers. We have not been
&gt; inundated with offers from people with CD Recorders to
&gt; make copies. We need people to make the offer to make it
&gt; happen. (I know it's easier to make cassette dubs, but
&gt; a cassette tree sounds like crap within three generations).
&gt; 
&gt;    So, if you have a CD-R and some time (or $500 burning
&gt; a hole in your pocket to buy one) please make it happen.
&gt; 
##### I don't think this is a bad thing in principle, as long as you
don't try to rake in royalty-free profits off it.
The thought of doing it one day, when time and equipment permit, has
crossed my mind. Of course, my version would absoutely epitomize good
taste. ;-)

&gt;    Myself, I'm working on cleaning up the tape hiss with
&gt; Sound Forge and don't plan to burn a CD until I get some
&gt; decent results.

##### Sounds like a great idea in principle. Just don't overdo it--any
sounds you rub out along with the hiss are just plain gone.
