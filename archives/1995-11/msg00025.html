WretchAwry &lt;vickie@pilot.njin.net&gt; just got me SO excited when she mentioned:

* Vickie (thankful for Kirsty MacColl, because if we hadn't gone to
*        see her *wonderful* concert, I wouldn't have set the timer 
*        to record the Academy Awards.)

I know I promised a Kirsty post a while back, but I've just been soooooo
busy, but just to jump on and expand this thread a little while it's still
news, and knowing me, I'll digress:  

Kirsty plays the Great American Music Hall in SF next Tuesday, April 4. 
Of course, I have my tix, and it being general admission, I plan to get there
early to get a front seat to see the artist whose music I have 
played more often than any other in the last few years.  Ooh, fellow Katefans,
please don't tread on me too hard for admitting that, ok?  :-{

But it's true!  I currently listen to Kirsty more often than any other artist
in my collection. I deeply love her music, and it must be because I feel a 
kind of kinship to Kirsty's sentiments, a lot of them dealing with 
love-gone-wrong, my favorite theme. :-)  Her lyrics are emotional, intelligent,
and lots of times based in "anger", another of my favorite themes. ;-)   
When you couple this with her beautiful, plaintive voice, which was so 
appropriately described by a reviewer once as being "...able to melt butter." 

Her latest release is called "Galore", on IRS.  It's a collection of some of 
her "hits" and include some b-sides, the classic "Fairytale of New York" with 
the Pogues, and two new songs, "Caroline" and "Perfect Day (w/Evan Dando)"
are included in this generous 18-cut release. (I think Perfect Day is new.)
This album, together with the album "The Essential Collection" will give 
new listeners a great overview of Kirsty's incredible talent.  My personal 
favorite Kirsty album is _Electric Landlady_.  

So what ABOUT Victoria??  Victoria Williams also is on tour, and plays the 
Great American Music Hall the Friday after Kirsty, on April 7th.  

I am like, in heaven... And Vickie, it's all your fault! :-) !
