&gt;We've all participated in this year's heated gaffa debate. Now it's time
&gt;for another linguistic question: What does "Night Scented Stock" mean? I
&gt;have tried and tried and couldn't figure it out. My apologies if it's
&gt;obvious for you who have English as a mother tongue.

I had the same question as Anders which has now been answered.

I'm not so sure that having English as a mother tongue is going to help 
much
in deciphering these things.  I have spoken English and only English for 
almost 31
years, and  I can honestly say that quite frequently I have NO IDEA what 
K8's talking about.
One must journey to the UK, home of the GR8 K8, and ask the fine citizens 
there.  I would 
guess that there are a lot of inside jokes and cultural references that a 
person couldn't understand
without the aid of the BBC and all of the shared experiences therein.  I 
would suspect in K8's case
that it helps to have also been raised Catholic (reference the Gaffa 
debate)

Any UK Love Hounds care to comment on this?  I for one was surprised at 
the influence that
movies have had on her work over the years.
