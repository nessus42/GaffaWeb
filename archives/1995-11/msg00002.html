Archive-name: music/kate-bush-faq-diffs
Last-modified: 1995/03/19
Version: 1.2.p minus 1.2.k

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action.  The full version is posted to
rec.music.gaffa only.  You can get a full copy of the FAQ by requesting it from
me (uli@zoodle.robin.de).  If you subscribe to the list (done by sending
email to love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net) Bill Wisner will also provide you
with the full FAQ.  If you can't receive more than 64KB in one piece I can
split the FAQ for you.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.  Cosmetical changes aren't listed.

Sorry again for being late, but I tend to work on all my incoming mail first,
there might be something important in there that belongs into the FAQ.

-------------------8&lt;-------------------

This FAQ is completely free though not public domain.  I hereby declare I have
no right at all to stop anyone from posting this text if I ever lose the
ability or desire to post it by myself.  The only thing I require is that any
future maintainer will declare this too.  If you want to quote anything from it
outside of anything connected with Love-Hounds or rec.music.gaffa you have
to give the source (i.e. Love-Hounds or rec.music.gaffa).  This FAQ may be
redistributed in its entirety in any form on any medium, even be sold.

[change: the FAQ isn't public domain. I've been told (hi Don!) that being PD
requires that there be no limitations at all. So it's 'just' completely free now]

1.5. T-Shirts?

     There now is a second edition of The Official Lovehounds-T-Shirt.  It
     features the album cover of The Dreaming, but "Suspended in
     rec.music.gaffa" above it (the Suspende In Gaffa single used the same
     picture).  The back shows "love-hounds@uunet.uu.net" over a handwritten
     letter Kate gave to Doug Alan in New York in December '93.

                        To Everyone at
                                 "Love Hounds"
                        Thanks for all your support
                              With Love
                               Kate Bush
                                     xx

[It wasn't "years ago", it was just 16 months. I thought the text was way
older. Thanks |&gt;oug for clarifying this!]

4.4. Basic Discography/Videography

     Early in November '94 the next and last set of singles for The Red Shoes
     appeared, again in the UK only: And So Is Love.  Two CD singles (regular
     and with 3 video-prints), a Cassingle and a 7" picture single in a poster
     bag (giant 40"x60" poster) have appeared.

[Added the '94 to the November date, before I forget to change it when it's
not the latest November anymore...]

     This Woman's Work Boxed Set (TWW, 1990).
[... the Japanese version has ...]
            - more and bigger booklets in Japanese, including lyrics in
              English and Japanese, especially also for the two special CDs.
              The Japanese text basically is a hybrid of the biography
              entries from "Kate Bush Complete" and "A Visual Documentary"
              [TC2].  The text parts of the English booklets are contained
              completely in the Japanese booklets (in English language even).

[It wasn't clear before that there's nothing textually in the English booklets
that's not also in the Japanese booklets.]

5.   Questions about Kate's music

5.4. Never for Ever

     The Infant Kiss:
        The song is inspired by the movie "The Innocents", starring Deborah
        Kerr, which is based on Henry James' book "Turn of the Screw".

[new section]

5.5. The Dreaming

     Houdini:
        Harry Houdini (born Erich Weiss) was an escapologist who managed to
        escape by using a key that was passed to him by his wife Bess with a
        kiss she always gave him before he was bound and drowned.  ("With a
        kiss, I'd pass the key.")  Now Houdini and his wife previously agreed
        on a secret code ("Rosabel, believe!"), which he should use via a
        medium after his death to let her know about after-life.  At one point
        Bess was given the code by a "psychic," but she later found out that he
        obtained it from a former servant of Houdini's (it *was* simply their
        favorite song, rather than some involved code.)  So, it's easy to see
        how the confusion has happened.  Bess *once* stated that a "psychic"
        had given her the code, then she retracted that statement.  As usually
        happens, the people who want to believe in "psychic phenomena" accept
        want they want and disregard the rest.  So the first claim of contact
        is more widely reported than the true (but less romantic) story.
        Kate's song is closer in the details to the Hollywood film starring
        Tony Curtis than to the real events of Houdini's life and art.  This is
        in no way intended to disparage Kate's song, which concentrates on the
        *emotional*, rather than the biographical aspects of Houdini and Bess'
        relationship. [some of this by CW]

[clarified the various names of Harry Houdini]

5.6. Hounds of Love

     Hounds of Love:
        The beginning ("It's in the trees!  It's coming!") is from the 1957
        UK horror movie "Night of the Demons" (US title: "Curse Of The Demon",
        original title: "Casting The Runes"), though Kate re-recorded the bit,
        because she couldn't get enough quality from the original.

That's it for this month!
