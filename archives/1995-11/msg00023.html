OPEN THE HEAVENS

PURPOSE OF CONFERENCE
"Equipping the saints to do the worship ministry"

The primary purpose of this conference is to train and release people to
worship God.  Additionally, it is designed to equip those persons called
into worship ministry/leading.  To accomplish this, the conference will
cover topics such as "Centrality of Worship", "Worship in The Church",
and "Worship: A Window To Heaven".

To learn these truths, our prayer is that God will "Open The Heavens"
and visit us with His presence.  To facilitate this, we will have a
number of extended times of worship.



THE SPEAKERS
We are delighted to have some of the Vineyard's finest worship
leaders/speakers at this conference.  All three have extensive
experience in the area of ministering in, or teaching on, worship.

Phoenix area out of their congregation.  Brian has a passion for prayer
