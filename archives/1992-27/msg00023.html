Hi all,

once or twice a year I buy a CD that doesn't fit into my normal musical taste.
Then it has to be something more dance-like or so. Before reading the 
'Kate cover versions list' I didn't know that Blue Pearl did a cover of
'Running Up That Hill'. But, nonetheless, that CD from Blue Pearl was on my 
'try to find and listen to it' list. Just recently I found it, found out that
this CD is the one with RUTH on it and bought it without first listening to it.
And I don't regret that. RUTH is really quite beautiful and has a soul feeling.
I would say that this RUTH version is more influenced by the Amnesty 
International live version of RUTH, that makes sense since in both versions
Dave Gilmour is playing the guitar. For those who want to know: The Blue Pearl
CD is called 'naked' and is from 'Big Life Records', outside UK it
is marketed and distributed by Polidor, exept in Germany by Metronome Musik 
GmbH and France by Phonogram SA. It's order number is 'BLR CD4 - 847405-2'.

But that was not the best CD I found on that day. I also found Loreena 
McKennitt's 'The Visit' and I can really, really recommend to listen to that
one. I would say that it is something like 'Clannad goes Pop', i.e. it has
an Irish sound but is not too much folk or spherical oriented. Try to find 
that CD! (Warner Bros., 9 26880-2). Now I want to know: Are the other CDs
Loreena has published equally good? As I understand from a recent article,
she has published three other CDs. (BTW: I really 'found' the CD in my local
CD store: They had ordered it for another customer, I took the CD to one of
their CD players, took a listen (something you always can do there) and 
immediately repeated the order of the other customer.)

Uli
