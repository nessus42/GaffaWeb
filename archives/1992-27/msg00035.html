You see, I went to see Tori Amos live last night.
I've been looking forward to this for weeks, not the least of which reasons is
that Knox Vegas is a sleepy little burg, but mainly because Tori has become my
moon goddess.   ;)

The 'cert was at the Bijou Theatre, which is a wonderful old building which is
trying to raise money for air-conditioning.  They still don't have it, but
luckily the weather is becoming nicer here in K-town.

The concert itself was great.  Better than sex, even.  The only song I can
think of from _LE_ that she didn't play is "Girl", and she played "Smells Like
Teen Spirit" and "Angie."

Somebody named A Man Called E was suppose to open for her, but evidently he was
sick, or fired, or something, so a local K-villian named R.B. Morris (really
popular here 'bouts (with damn good reason)) opened for her.  He's a
bluesy-kinda' guitar player.  It was nice.

But the concert was over, and I was shakey in the knees,and I went and waited
with the crowd outside for her to come out so's I could play fanboy.
And I did.
And she hugged me.
And said I had nice dimples.
And I almost cried.

She's so NICE to people!!!  It was lalala.

Anyway, I picked up a little form to join the fanboy club, and it has this
little space (and I mean little) to tell where one first heard of her.  Well, I
first heard of her right here, on rec.music.gaffa, but I'm not sure how to
write that in the little "OTHER ________________" space.
Any ideas?

Anyone know when next she will be in Athens, Atlanta, Nashville, or anyplace in
between?

Anyway, be good kids.
