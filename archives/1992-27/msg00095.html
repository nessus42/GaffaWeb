Well, I just got my mailing from Intergalactic Garage.  Here's what I'm
ordering from them:  Nothing.

Not because of any politics, attitude, or any other excuse like that.  It's
just that they don't have anything I want (at the moment).  If I were just
starting out my music collection, it would be a Goldmine (put your own joke
here), but they didn't have the one thing that interests me at the moment:
the Never Forever Boxed Set (rumor has it that it includes a life-size blowup
doll of Kate).  I want to keep getting mail from them - they have potential,
but they swung &amp; missed this time 'round.

Still no word from C-Side.

Also, this debate about boots:

I don't dislike bootlegs not for any moral reason (I try to avoid having
morals unless I can make money from them), but because 80% of the boots out
there (not just Kate, but other artists, both ones I like &amp; the Grateful
Dead) are Live in Concert bootlegs, and I don't even like most "Studio"
live albums, never mind ones that sound like they were recorded off of a
"My first Sony".  As for bootlegs of "Rare Sessions" (such as the 8,000+
Beatles Abbey Road sessions), do I REALLY care if they have a version of
"Here Comes the Sun" with an extra two notes at the end? (Or, to put it
in Katian Terms, a version of "Experiment IV" with a so-overused-it-could-
be-a-Saturday-Night-Live-skit-voice-over?  I think not.

Bootlegs I approve of:  Ones of songs you can't get anywhere else, or at least
for a reasonable price (such as, say, they Cathy Demos).  If I could buy an
official everyone-gets-the-royalties-they-deserve of Kate's B-Sides, I would
in a minute.  But I can't, so recorded it from a friend who spent gobs of
cash on TWW boxed set.  Hey, XTC has a couple of rarities &amp; B's albums,
why can't Kate? (Outside the boxed set, I mean).
