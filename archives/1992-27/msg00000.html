Well, it's been a long time since IED's been able to type THAT 
subject heading to Love-Hounds, and alas! it'll be another long time
before it happens again.

Actually, this may already long since have been reported here, but IED
has not been around in a while, so...

VOX Magazine has a brief news report updating the rumors about Kate
and Prince.  As IED remembers it, Kate was seen talking intently with
Prince after one of his recent London concerts, and the assumption was
that they were discussing new plans to work together.  The report also
stated that there was a rumor of a four-track EP featuring recordings
that the two had already done together, and which was never released
(as we all know).  This was supposed to be the explanation for
Prince's thankyou to Kate on his last album. IED hopes this isn't all
just a repeat of someone else's old posting.  There was a little more
in the VOX report, but IED can't remember how it was worded.  Anyone?

Also, IED wonders if some knowledgeable and enterprising philocanine
might want to post this news to a Prince computer discussion group (if
there is one), in hopes that people there will keep an ear out for any
new four-track bootleg of Prince (with a funny-voiced Englishwoman
singing along with him) that might crop up among the seeming thousands
of such products that glut the Princefans' market these days...

   She really is...
 
P.S.: Visitors to New York City might want to stop in at Rebel Rebel
Records in Greenwich Village, where the proprietor keeps a poster
hanging from the ceiling over the cash register -- a poster of Kate
(from The Sensual World, the one with the orange band at the bottom)
signed and dedicated to Rebel Rebel by Kate in her characteristic
hand, in silver marker...A good place to keep up to date on Kate items
when you're in town...
