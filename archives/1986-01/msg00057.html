Well, Love-Hounds lovers, I think I just learned not to post 
off-of-the-top-of-my-head discographies...
First off, mea culpa.  It is indeed FINE Young Cannibals,
and Doug, you are correct, the band contains two former members
of the late lamented Beat; namely their bassist and lead guitar
player (one is David Steele, the other's name escapes me right now).

(NAUGHTY BOY FANNY SLAP TIME)
Remember, Doug - repeat after me:  
"'The Dreaming' was MY FAVORITE album of 1982, since it's MY FAVORITE 
album of all time"... 
I blush when you say four-letter words in music circles ("best") :-)
Naughty Naughty...

Now for the errata.  Here, in toto, is the Compleat Guide to

	Garlands (4AD CAD 211) (1982)
	Head Over Heels (4AD CAD 313) (1983)
	Treasure (4AD CAD 412) (1984)

	As mentioned before, there is the American compilation LP of Lp tracks
and singles, "The Pink Opaque" (1985)

As I said, Liz and Robin have appeared on/produced many other records on the
4AD label.  For those of you who have picked up the This Mortal Coil LP
"It'll End In Tears", there is also a 7" single of the track "Kangaroo" on 4AD,
and before the LP was released (ASIDE TO "CRITICS" -  RELEASED IN SEPT. 198*4*,
ASSHOLES! NOT 85), the Tim Buckley song that Liz sings on the LP was released
as a 12" single (also 4AD).

Editorial Comment:
	The catalogue numbers that 4AD uses are quite good, and I wish other
record companies would follow their lead.  Briefly:
- If a record is a 7" single, the Cat. # begins with AD.
- If it is a 12" EP, it begins with BAD.
- If it is an LP, it begins with CAD.
- The number that follows is :
	- First digit is the release year - 1980 (What happens in 1990? :-)
	- Rest of number is sequential order that record was released in year.

	Thus, for the Cocteaus' "Aikea-Guinea" (Cat. BAD 501), you instantly
know that it was a 12" EP, released in 1985, and it was the first record
that 4AD released in 1985.  Likewise, Bauhaus' "Terror Couple Kill Colonel"
(Cat. AD 7) was a 7", released in 1980, and the 7th record 4AD released in '80.
Simple, huh?
