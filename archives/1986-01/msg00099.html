Someone just gave me the advance cassette of the "Pretty in Pink" soundtrack.
"P.i.P." is the new film by the guy who directed "The Breakfast Club" and
"16 Candles" -- I think his name is John Hughes, but I'm not positive -- and
it stars Molly Ringwald, one of the more appealing of those horrid brat pack
people.  Still, I doubt I'll rush out to see it.

It has a new song by Suzanne Vega, "Left of Center," which is pretty crummy
(for lack of a better descriptive adjective) -- she did it in concert and
I didn't like it then, either.  One expects more from SV, one of the coolest
women in the universe.  It sounds like a stab at the Top 40.

Fortunately, there's also a brand new one from New Order, "Shell Shock,"
which I like quite a bit.  What else?  The Psychedelic Furs REMADE "Pretty
in Pink" -- blasphemy!!!  The A&amp;M rep told me that it had a "punkier edge"
but it really sounds like a second-rate cover version.  Or it would, if it
weren't for Richard Butler's voice.  

The rest -- "Round, Round" (Belouis Some); "Wouldn't It Be Good" (Danny
Hutton Hitters -- would you believe a cover version of a Nik Kershaw
song??????); "Bring On The Dancing Horses" (Echo and the Bunnymen); "Please
Please Please Let Me Get What I Want" (The Smiths); "If You Leave" (OMD);
"Get To Know Ya" (Jesse Johnson); and "Do What You Do" (INXS).  Better than
most soundtrack LPs, but that's not saying much, is it? 

Do you ever wonder what your fellow Love-Hounders and net.music contributors
look like?  I do.  Perhaps we could put together some kind of photo album!
Then I can find out if Larry Palena is really green and slimy or if he only
writes that way.

A Morgan Fairchild look-a-like,
-Sue
