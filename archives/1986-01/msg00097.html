rock star image? tim? gee I never got that impression ... maybe Lyle Preslar
but I thought they were anti-cockrock star .... guess I never saw them live
being in the dregs of Virginia at the time...

As for 10,00000000 MAniacs - don't believe Sue - these guys have little
intensity or energy and showed supreme disrespect for the audience.  And
I thought they *were* trendy, gee ...

If a band called DOGGY STYLE comes through your town - go see!  These guys
are hilarious ... color coordinated because they explain it makes them
feel like men they even revised the pogo getting everyone in the place
to jump up and down.  How untrendy! as if I care.  If you saw the Debby
Harry Spin - you might have noticed them demonstrating their dance ... well,
the last song, they got everyone who wasn't confused jumping around yelling,
"Doggy Style" when the singer yelped "How ya gonna do it?" ... They did a
bunch of go-go styles tunes which is Really untrendy and even a Beastie Boys
tune,, "She's On It" and, gawd, the Beasties are Super-duper untrendy ... I
even got one of the Tootsie Pops they threw out to the audience - By the time
I got to them, they had sold out their LP (Side By Side on Flipside Records)
but I'm gonna send away for it as soon as I get a money order - and what they
hell, if I don't like it I'll just give it to my Kid Sister...

Marginal Man, Black Market Baby and Urgent Fury - - - Marginal Man is on
tour and you'd better go see them - you won't forgive yourself when they
become the next big trendy thing and you can then say "I saw them when they
were untrendy" -- as for Black Market and Urgent Fury - well 2 good bands outta
4 ain't bad... Black Market Baby told alot of good jokes ... Urgent Fury was
way too serious - but what do you expect from a Puerto Rican hardcore band
from the Bronx?
