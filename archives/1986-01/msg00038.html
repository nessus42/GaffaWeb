Descendents/Dag Nasty 930 club, 

Big News: Dag Nasty will be putting out a 7" 4-song Ep on Dischord
in a month or so !! Dischord # 19 for those keeping count. 

Other Big News:  I had my first drink in a month ! Whoa boy, calm down.
Had too, after I found out that Husker Du and Soul Asylum will
be playing the 9:30 on Feb. 9th.  Had another one when I both 
my tickets (2 for 19.00, big bucks for big stars).  Total = 2 Beers, 
2 Tickets, 2 bands. one night.

Dag Nasty came up. The singer is now on lesson 6 of "Ian Mckaye's
16 steps to be a big time rock singer".  The band as a whole has 
improved since the last time I saw them, and there still improving.
I was more impressed this time.

In between sets you could hang out watching videos (like Til Tuesday's
video of "Voices Carry" while listening to the Gang Green version of
the same song) or go to the back bar for some good drinks or go outside
and listen to Peter Murray of Marginal Man and John Stabb of GI's talk
about their motorcycles (how macho are you??) or go around the corner
and hit the peep shows.  I myself like top stand outside a peep show 
house (no particular one) and when someone would exit, make it look like
I'm writing down information about them.  These clods then get all
nervous and uptight and want to know what your doing.  Then you tell
then you work for Jerry Falwell or something along those lines. They
hit the road fast.  Still waiting for one to pull a knife on me.

okay, okay, here come the descendents.  With Bill Stevenson back 
from Flag and Milo back from college, they ripped through their set.
And ripped through was right. Not one break between songs, just 
barrelling through most of their new songs.  Problem with the guitar
player, never turned to face the audience at all. guess he didn't like 
the way we looked. 

Still More big news: John Labovitz is in England now. who knows what
kind of deviant behavior he's unleashing on the countryside. 

look for the descendents in your town soon.
