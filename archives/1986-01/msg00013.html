&gt; From jer:

&gt; It's hard to believe that poetry that is consistent, and basically
&gt; good poetry, should also be accidental.  I can believe that of Jon
&gt; Anderson, who writes meaningless phrases that you find meaning in,
&gt; like patterns on a randomly-patterned wall, but not with coherent
&gt; poetry.

I've written a little bit of (bad) poetry.  What's really strange is
that often I just write what I think is nonsense.  A bunch of phrases
that pop into my mind, with images and vague symbols -- but nothing
coherent.  Then I might find the poem in a pile of junk a while later,
and when I read it, I know exactly what it means.  So, did I put that
meaning there unconsciously when I wrote the poem?  Or did I just read
that meaning into the poem later?

&gt; Maybe there's more to it than that... I wonder if John Carder Bush
&gt; reads her lyrics and says, "why don't you change this to say ..." ?

I dunno.  Maybe, but I kind of doubt it.  What's interesting is that
Kate said that the "tenner" / "tenor" double entendre was not intended.
On the other hand, I asked John Carder Bush if the "morning" /
"mourning" double entendre in "My Lagan Love" was intentional and he
said that it was.  Now I really want to ask Kate if the triple entendre
with "I wash the panes" (" I wash the windows" / "I cry" / "I wash the
hurt and pain") in "Get Out Of My House" was intentional.  It seems *so*
perfect that it must have been!  But if she thinks about this enough to
have come up with such a perfect triple entendre here, then how could
she have missed the "tenner" / "tenor" pun?  Maybe it is all
intentional, but only subconsciously....

There was a very interesting interview with Kate in a recent issue of
Hot Press.  She says some things that seem to hint that she does operate
on a subconcious level for many things.  For example, the interviewer
asked her about the covers to "Lionheart" and "Hounds of Love" and said
they might be seen as being somewhat kinky.  Kate said that she hadn't
thought about them that way before, but now that he mentioned it, maybe
she did see that they could be seen that way.

			Knowing no feeling
			My mind wanders through your world
			Only words live now

P.S.  John Bush said that he'd be willing to send me some of his poetry.
But I haven't gotten off my butt yet and written a letter to him.
Anyone else interested?
