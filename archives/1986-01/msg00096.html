Here are my 10 albums, all post 1977.  I guess I have problems with
this because I do listen to many albums that were put out before
1977 that never were quite 'with it' (ie, Mothers of Invention, Hawkwind, etc).
But I gave it a shot to see what I could come up with off the top of my
head.  Here goes (in random order).....

1. Laurie Anderson - United States I-V.
    Five records, this would keep the most sane man busy for months 
    listening to.  Everything you need out of her, and then some.

2. Joy Division - Still
    This is not Wham! 

3. Husker Du - Zen Arcade
    The gurus of electricfied folk music rip down everything.  
    Listen to side 2 for catharis, and side 4 for 'Reoccurring Dreams'.

4. Minor Threat - Out of Step
    Beyond their rock-star image was a band with more intensity than 
    i've seen in awhile.  This ep is the Threat at their peak, with decline 
    being immiment.

5. Motorhead - No Remorse
    I wanted 'Space Ritual' but it was pre-77, so this will do quite nicely.
    And this one does get played quite loud.

6. Soft Boys - Invisible Hits

7. Velvet Underground - VU
    But this album was released in 1985 !! Whew, I needed to get a VU 
    album on my list somehow.  Not the best, but the only one released 
    after 1977.

8. Brian Eno/David Bryne - My Life in the Bush of Ghosts.

9. Robert Fripp - Exposure
    The Best King Crimson Album. Ever.

10. Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers - Modern Lovers
     This one was recorded in 1977 when the Modern Lovers still had Dave
     Robinson.  Album contains 'New England' 'Here Come the Martian Martians'
     and 'Abomidable Snowman in the Market' among others.  But what I would
     give for a version of 'Roadrunner'. 


Pre-77 releases which caught my eye:

Hawkwind - Space Ritual
Velvet Underground - White Light/White Heat
Mothers of Invention - Freak Out
Brian Eno - Another Green World
King Crimson - A Young Person's Guide to King Crimson
