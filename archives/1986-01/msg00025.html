	To start off the new year two weeks late, a bunch of
mini-reviews...


The Explorers	Falling for Nightlife/Crack the Whip (12" single)

	The Explorers are Andy McKay, Phil Manzanera and James
Wraith (who? --- on vocals). Nice elegant dance music in the Roxy
Music mode, but nothing terribly spectacular. Wraith really sounds
like Bryan Ferry sometimes, especially on Crack the Whip.

Tuxedomoon	Holy Wars

	This was on some Best of '85 lists, but I was very disappointed
especially after the long wait. Blaine Reininger is gone, and the
band has a more commercial sound. Some of the tracks resemble good
film music, but nothing special. Winston Tong does a good Jim 
Morrison imitation on Bonjour Tristesse, but this is overall a
lowkey, unimpressive effort despite a few interesting moments.

Sonic Youth	Bad Moon Rising

	This is the most interesting album of '85 I've heard (sorry
Kate). Love that vicious guitar sound and the wailing, distraught
vocals. A set of harrowing, unforgettable sound pictures.

Fred Frith	Gravity

	If you like Fred Frith, you'll love this collection of
fake folk music and demented arrangements of light music cliches.
Frith is almost the Residents of the guitar.

Birdsongs of the Mesozoic	Magnetic Flip

	I was disappointed not to find their cover of Sombre Reptiles
on this album (is it on the EP, Doug?) Many interesting bits
here, though I liked side two and the Rocky/Bulwinkle theme better
than side one and the Rite of Spring variations.

Eberhard Weber	Colours

	You don't really hear Weber's rich bass lines that much in
this album (there's very little that compares with his solos in
Mother Stands for Comfort, for instance). His band plays very well
though. A nice album, just not enough Eberhard Weber.

Roy Harper/Jimmy Page	Jugula+

	Good '80s folk rock with strong political lyrics. Some of
the songs are too long for what they have to say, in my opinion.
There are some great snide remarks about the British music press
on the inner sleeve.
