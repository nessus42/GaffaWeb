Hello All,
 
Got through that time then.
 
Thanks to those who responded to my last post. Yes, of course you 
enjoy your flame wars. Why did I doubt it?
 
No, of course I don't have to read the flames. Perhaps if I can ever
figure out how to operate a killfile I may well use it. Perhaps I was 
misunderstood. The flames aren't driving me away from Gaffa - I find 
it too useful. But it seems to have driven other people, 
non-participants in the flames, away, and that seemed sad to me. 
Still, as no doubt many are thinking, "who am I..." etc. etc.
 
The reason for my post was very simply that in KBfandom, generally, 
in my experience, people are quite nice to each other, and protective 
of Kate too. Quaint, isn't it? Ed Suranyi patiently explains to me 
that it isn't quite that way in usenet land. So be it. I've had my 
twopenn'th.
 
Luckily I don't have the time "to bicker and argue about who killed
who," so I'll just make some brief responses.
 
I can appreciate the fact that Jon Drukman (hello Jon - getting
a swipe from you must mean I've now passed my Gaffa initiation)
does not like the style of some of the artwork in HOMEGROUND, and 
thinks that it's too airy-fairy (well, some of it anyway), but 
actually he's wrong  in drawing the conclusion that we see Kate in 
that way ie. as some kind of fairy princess. We have actually been on 
the set of a couple of Kate's videos, and seen her at work, and have 
met with her to discuss conventions etc. I don't think we labour under 
any delusions as to her personal divinity. Kate certainly doesn't. 
 
Her work now, as we both agree,  - that's (generally speaking)  
something different.
 
Fmcquarr@sfu.ca (sorry, your post did not reveal any other name)
raises an interesting point. Can we differentiate between Kate's
personal sexuality, and the sexuality of her art? It seems quite 
clear to me that there is a great difference between a discussion 
of the references to human sexuality in the work of any given artist
and gossip about whether that artist has slept with any other named 
celebrity of the same sex or not. 
 
Incidentally, did you find that series of HOMEGROUND articles 
interesting? Krys laboured long and hard on them and would appreciate 
any comment and follow up.
 
Odds + Sods dept:
 
Fabienne Grenier, one of our French subscribers has sent us a copy
of an article from a Russian music magazine whose title I cannot
reproduce as this keyboard isn't fluent in Cyrillic. Dated February 
1991, the magazine included a flexi-disc with two tracks "Babooshka" and

"Fullhouse".
