Jeffy denies:
&gt;I came out viciously against your crossposting warmroom stuff to Ecto.
&gt;It seems that even a year later you still don't get it.  Somehow, this is
&gt;not surprising.

No, you liar, you came out against the idea of another warm, cozy mailing
list.

&gt;[examples of naughty things I wrote which are apparently still making Jorn's
&gt;life a living hell mostly deleted]

Thanks for your caring concern.

&gt;&gt;&gt;"Jorn... is trying to forcibly create a friendly space..."
&gt;
&gt;You deny this?  Weren't you saying "Be nice 'n friendly on warmroom or I'll
&gt;kick you out, and I am sole arbiter of who is nice 'n friendly."

No comment. 

Jeffy throws caution to the winds:
&gt;Look, fool, anyone who knows me can tell you that I *don't* need to hide
&gt;behind anonymous e-mail.  If I have something to say, I say it, with my
&gt;name in the header, my name and the bottom, and my .signature at the end.
&gt;While I recognize that some people have the need to take advantage of
&gt;anonymous posting services for various reasons, I'm not one of them.  I
&gt;have nothing to hide and I stand behind what I say.  In fact, this is the
&gt;first time I've written anything addressed toward you since my very first
&gt;(and quite cordial, I'll add) response to your original 'vibes' posting.
&gt;You're welcome to think otherwise; you're also welcome to be wrong.

Since Vickie (and, presumably Chris) choose to back Jeffy up on this
question, I'll lay out the stylistic arguments:

Category One: Underlining style BOTH *asterisks* and _underscores_
(this is unique to Jeffy, in my experience)

This is *not* warmroom.

_Please_ do not post warmroom material to ecto.  If I want KaTe info, I'll
go to r.m.g.  It's more fun that way.

you're missing one obvious possibility:  that your inability to experience,
to *sense* those feelings from a CD is a shortcoming of your own and not
of the CD media.

magnetic tape with another tape of Mary Coughlan, _would you be able
to tell_?  Are your certain you wouldn't experience that feeling, that
emotion you associate with the tape now?

Subject: Crazyheaded Jorn

You refuse--nay, you shrink from--discussing the orig-
inal proposal, and instead, dextrous sleight of hand, have misdirected the
discussion so that it is now *about* the discussion.

     Leave us _our_ freedom.  We've heard what you have to say, and been
left, reeling in your cloud of irrelevancies, to presume what you've re-
fused to say, and yes, we have rejected your method of discourse.


===============
Category Two:  Straining for poetic effect

[04 Feb 92]
There would have been a sort of dishonesty about it, like a
genuine faux diamond; it may glitter, but you can crush it under your heel.

[08 April 93]
You, Jorn, have singlehandely brought this discussion to the level at
which it now creeps, scales in the mud, forward.

This device, this disingenuousness, this self deception, became, anon, a 
crutch.

You're  a caveman who explains rain as the tears of the gods be-
cause he's afraid to admit he don't know what it is.

You try desperately to replace the curtain, whose warp is misdirection and 
whose woof is abuse, and hide your tiny little theory.

Jorn, who the hell do you think you are? Where, out of what turbulent
pocket of polluted air, do you snatch the gall to say what you've said to
these people, in the way you've said it?

And yet, I've said less, and still less.

==================
Category Three: Intense cynicism

[04 Feb 92]
...we _have_ Ecto already; why do you folks feel like you need _another_ cozy 
little mailing list?

...when Jorn decided to share his little "golden" image with us, I couldn't
handle it anymore.

[08 April 93]
The only people
who have not expressed a desire for you to just go away and have your
breakdown in private are the ones who enjoy watching you go down in flames.

     Ending on a positive note:  Thanks, Jorn, for having your breakdown
in public.  This has been the most fun I've had since I witnessed a six=
car pileup, with deaths, several years ago.  Bleed on.

[16 April 93]
I *love* it!  This needs to be framed and mounted on the wall!

I AM THE ANTICHRIST!  I lead my legion of EctoDemons in the fight against
all that is good--the angels in flight for the Good Witch Jorn.

...I'll admit to a special little thrill when you called me "evil"...


======================
Category Four: Conceptualization of Jorn's 'errors'

[04 Feb 92]
gone so far overboard

trying to forcibly create a friendly space

Do you have put so little stock in your own opinions
that you feel nobody could possibly find them interesting unless they're 
people
dedicated to making you feel warm and cozy?

[28 March 93]
you're missing one obvious possibility:  that your inability to experience,
to *sense* those feelings from a CD is a shortcoming of your own and not
of the CD media.

[08 April 93]
You've gone off the subject (who thought I was about to say 'off the
deep end'?)

You say you want to win general agreement.  What a totalitarian term
you make of that.  What you want is to win.

What you demand is deference
and awe.  It's very important to you that you be the one who defines the
truth.

You, who are trying to impose your values system on others

You stand
and assert your freedom, Jorn, but even as you do you proclaim this town
not big enough for two modes of thought.

it your way if only they had the equipment to understand.  And until then,
you're more than happy to shoulder your burden of being the only person
who understands truth.  You, Jorn, are the center of the universe.

I see you sitting on a bus and telling the poor soul next to you how every-
body's against you.

[16 April 93]
Weren't you saying "Be nice 'n friendly on warmroom or I'll
kick you out, and I am sole arbiter of who is nice 'n friendly."

if you'd posted some of the drivel we've seen here to
warmroom, you would have had to delete yourself from that mailing list.

Your delusions of grandeur, your idea that all the forces of Ecto are
gathering to lay waste to you, is laughable.

This conspiracy theory actually suits you quite well.

this little self-lovefest you've got going

if you're going to go *this* far over the top

===========================
Category Five: science arguments

[28 March 93]
You seem to try to argue that the recording on the medium is actually 
changed by the vibes you put out while it's playing--you mention the
idea of "re-etching" and that the recording of the music is changed
(as opposed to the imprint being with the basic physical object).  How
is my play-only walkman any more likely to re-record-with-emotiona-imprint
on my tape than my discman?

[08 April 93]
(Just throwing down, for your patronizing disdain, a rational reac-
tion to your theory:  Film, when exposed to light reflecting off an ob-
ject, records no image of that object: only white light.  Control the
light with a lens, however, and you have an image clear enough to deter-
mine the nature of its subject.  What is the "lens" of this process of
recording emotions onto magnetic tape?  Is it likely that, even were these
"vibes" to have an effect on the tape, that their playback could possibly
be interpreted as an emotion similar to the one that produced the effect
in the first place?  Isn't it more likely that they would "play back" as
"white vibes"?  Remember, this effect would take place during the play
mode, not the record.)

===============================
Category Six: capitalized words

[08 April 93]
You accuse your questioners, Jorn, of being Kneejerk Scientismists.

Please, Old Mythologizer, 

[16 April 93]
I lead my legion of EctoDemons in the fight against
all that is good--the angels in flight for the Good Witch Jorn.


===========================
Misc punctuation:

Two-hyphens no spaces: thruout

Two-hyphens-no space-double quote:
[28 March 93]
changes then--"A stranger in an alien land"-- and

[08 April 93]
--"Jonni," etc.
words and phrases are there--"vibes", "magnetic tape", etc., 

Two spaces after end of sentence: thruout

Apostrophes: no errors, thruout (its-it's, plural-possessives)

Their/They're: correct thruout

Paragraph layout changed for anonymous [08 April] only, telegraphed by 
several slips in uniformity.  Hyphenation turned on for [08 April] (MLA 
hyphens)

Colon-space-space
March 28: once
April 08: four
(others, none)

Quotation marks: double everywhere but once [April 16]

Double or triple exclamation marks: never


(Need I go on?)

PS to the take-it-to-email crowd: this is my community too, I feel I
have a valid gripe that's profoundly important for all of us.  So stop
trying to sweep it under the rug, please?
