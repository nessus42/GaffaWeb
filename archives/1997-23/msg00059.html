Two Video's not full, but with a collection of many performances Kate did
throughout the world. Including the Efteling Special in Holland! The
quality of these recordings however is very poor!! Sometimes you hardly see
any picture at all. Or the picture has no colour or is in balck and white.
However it is very worthwhile watching this collection ones in your life.

other strict conditions.
