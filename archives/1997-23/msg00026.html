I got hold of a copy of the EMI promotional shoebox just after the release
of TRS. I paid BP 200 for mine. At the moment you can buy it for around BP
150, which should go up again after the new album is released.

It is a dark red shoe box, same colour as the ballet shoes on the cover of
TRS. It has the circular TRS picture on the lid. On the side is another,
black label, which reads " Size 4 / Colour Red / Style Balled / KT".

There are no shoes in the box however. The box contains a factsheet and
discography, a slide, a black fountain pen with "Kate Bush - The Red Shoes
- 1993" written on it, a video tape with the two versions of Rubberband
Girl on it, TRS CD.

I am wondering if anybody has a copy of the Japanes promo "Moments of
Pleasure" (2CD). I have seen it advertised for BP 500 (well, BP 499.99 to
be more precise), and as far as I know that is the most valuable, together
with the Japanese promo release of Moving/Them Heavy People with the Seiko
advert (according to Record Collector).

&gt; 
&gt; As I recall, every bootlegger in town ran out and started making these
&gt; cheesey "shoebox" packages and just threw in whatever they could think
of.
&gt; 
&gt; There WAS an official EMI promotional shoebox, and as I recall it did NOT
&gt; contain shoes.  The ads for them that showed up in Goldmine shortly after
&gt; TRS release described them as having a CD, a bio on Kate, a Red Shoes
pen,
&gt; a photo or two, and possibly other trinkets.  I never saw a description
or
&gt; picture of the outside of the box.  
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone out there has one of these promo boxes would you kindly give us
a
&gt; good description of the box and contents?  
&gt; 
&gt; For a while these were selling for huge amounts of money; I even saw one
&gt; advertised for $300. U.S., which is ridiculous.  Having not looked at
&gt; Goldmine in ages I have no idea whether many of these are still in
&gt; circulation.  If anyone ever comes across one of these I'd be interested
in
&gt; having a look at the thing.
