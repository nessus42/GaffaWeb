&gt;&lt;&lt; Cal Asked:	
&gt; &gt; I like what I've heard of Kate Bush. I know she has many albums, but what
&gt; &gt; album do you think is the best? I only want to buy one for starters.
&gt; 
&gt; Hhmmm...  Kate's catalog is like a good novel.  You just can't start in the
&gt; middle, so go back to the beginning and fall in love with TKI.
&gt;  &gt;&gt;

The Whole Story is, to me, a perfectly wonderful album to start out listening
to, since it captures Kate over several years worth of work and provides
selections from the albums which preceded it.  I think it provides a lovely
overview of Kate's work and yet isn't resigned to portray simply one phase of
style, a phenomena of which all of the other albums cannot help but be
guilty.  

I personally fell in love with Kate after hearing The Dreaming.  The Whole
Story was the 2nd album I got and was entranced by the many different aspects
of her work which appeared on that album  I was unaware that it was a
compilation album and was impressed with her wide range of style, lyrical
content and depth of meaning.  However, until I began to listen to The Kick
Inside, Lionheart, N4E and Hounds of Love, I was totally unaware of how much
her style and subject matter changed from one album to the next and was
thrilled to discover how much more in-depth each album is--a depth which
naturally, as a compilation album, The Whole Story cannot provide.  So, there
is a down-side to The Whole Story, however, I still maintain that if you
intend to hook a listener onto Kate, The Whole Story is the perfect album to
play to achieve your goal.

Take this with yet another grain of salt,
~~~Samantha

P.S.  I am delighted to announce there is one more Kate fan to add to our
ever-growing population.  The conversion of which I speak is that of my
younger sister.  In 1989 I forced her to listen to Kate's music and she
despised it (and despised me for torturing her by such "inhumane"
means....but something must have caught her attention over the years, for
just last week, she mailed me a card wishing me a Happy Katemas. She stated
that Kate is "one of the wonders of the world."  So, the moral of this story
is:  Hang in there ....it may take time to make converts and at times,
people's thick-headedness may cause them to appear as hopelessly stupid
creatures who cannot possibly be worthy of the use of their names and the
words "good taste" in the same sentence, but eventually, KATE WILL
PREVAIL!!!!  &gt;:-}
