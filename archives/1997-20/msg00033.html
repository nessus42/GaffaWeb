&gt; I guess after one listens to enough pop and rock, it
&gt; all gets repetitive, so in the "Bang Your Head Against
&gt; The Glass" threads, I am only glad I am the age I am.
&gt; A great ride so far.  The seventies had good music, the
&gt; eighties had machines, and so far the nineties have
&gt; mostly had retreads.  The rockTrain is out of steam.
&gt;
&gt; When looking around for "tis new to me" things to listen
&gt; to, I've been exploiting the RealAudio plugin and checking
&gt; out the All India radio network.  Even at 14.4, there are
&gt; some fantastic pieces there for those who know about
&gt; bhajans and ghazals, etc.  One lady, Alisha (sp?) is
&gt; rather Kate-like in her soprano, use of polyrhythmic
&gt; arrangements, and yes, the 22-tone scale.  Cool stuff
&gt; for you musician/composers out there.  The work of the
&gt; Singhs (chita and ?) is also very intriguing.  There is
&gt; much to be learned there.
&gt;
&gt; Folks like to carp and wince, but most haven't
&gt; even escaped their radios and tellys yet, so, hey, it is
&gt; relative to cause and connections, ain't it?
&gt;
&gt; Ya gotta give Kate credit; she's always trying to bust
&gt; the mold.  That takes a lot research and experimenting.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, if any of you are going to Siggraph, check out the
&gt; IrishSpace demo.  Some of the list members will be there
&gt; demoing it.  Get them to play the Leaving Earth scene
&gt; if you want to see what we did with Mna h'Eireann.

=====Your note touches on something I've been giving a good deal of
thought to lately--bitcasting. So far, I haven't been in a good position
to cat on it much: Trouble is, the vast majority of sites blow you right
off (and understandably) if you only have a 14.4 modem. And even with a
56K--or even with ISDN--you still don't get terrific sound. But it's
probably at least as good as shortwave, maybe even AM. So I'd really
like to tap into it with a 56K modem, and expect to just as soon as
finances loosen just a tiny bit.

My Web site (below) has several artists mentioned--only about half a
dozen, but I get real emjoyment still out of them. There have to be a
lot more around, though, to add to that set. I just haven't had time to
check them out.
