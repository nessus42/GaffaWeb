Exactly!!!!

A lot of people are all too eager to get on a new artist's bandwagon.
Case in point:  Jewel.    She's cute-n-shit.   but where she'll be in 5
years will up to the record companies and promoters.   How the HELL can 
Jweel be a VH1 artist of the month....when she only HAS 1 album????  aarrgh!! 

In the past 3 years, I've "discovered" several bands &amp; artists that started 
their careers in the 60's.  Most of those artists are still around.  Their
longevity is indicative of the quality of their music.  For me, three come
to mind right away:   Grateful Dead, Moody Blues and Amazing Blondel.  I LOVE
those 3 bands.  I was fortunate enough to have seen 4 Dead shows before Jerry
Garcia died and I consider myself very lucky.  It was fabulous.  I've yet to
see The Moody Blues...but that's just a matter of time.  As for the 
Amazing Blondel, I can only hope they'll tour America...     

These three band (as well as many others of that era) offer a quality in their
music that I just can't find in the likes of Smashing Pumpkins, Cheryl Crow,
Alanis Morrisette and Green Day.   it seems that the newer bands just can't
play
their instruments....They bang them...but they can't "play".  The messages
that come across are often bleak and devoid of love (any of you "Generation
Xers" 
recognize yourselves?)   For my tastes, there have only been a select few
"newer"
bands that can make me stand up and pay attention:  Phish, Crash Test Dummies,
Tears For Fears and Bjork.  Tori Amos was there too, until Boys For Pele.  
Sonmehow, she switched gears and I can no longer identify myself with her.  but
I
still LOVE  Little Earthquakes and Under The Pink.

In recent years, there has been a certain "revival" of a lot of 60s and 70s
bands...what does that tell you?   It tells me that they offer something that
the newr bands don't have or can't deliver.   You'll see a lot more young
people liking Pink Floyd than older people liking Green Day.  There's got to
be a reason for that.....    It must be the music....

peace
