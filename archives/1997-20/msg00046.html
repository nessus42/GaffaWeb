I like it! I think his vocal range approximates Kate's with no problems
and even reminded me of Jeff Buckley singing the Corpus Christi Carol
from his album, Grace. Maxwell's soulful interpretation of the recurring
chorus lines is very moving and intensely intimate.

I tend to be wary of covers of Kate's songs because they are so unique
to her:  I sometimes can't imagine anyone else singing them and doing
them justice.  I know that's wrong, that it's perfectly possible for
other artists to re-interpret Kate, etc.  I should get out more I
'spose.

It made me think, what if at some point, a Kate tribute album was
produced, full of hoary old rockers like Rod Stewart singing Sat in Your
Lap, or  Phil Collins doing Hammer Horror.  I think this has the
definite makings of another list!!!  What do other lovehounds think?!
Let's be having your tracks/artists lists.

Seriously, my fave coupling would have been Jeff Buckley doing possibly
This Woman's Work or The Kick Inside.  Or Wendy Matthews, a
Canadian/Australian singer doing the same.  I can recommend Wendy's
three albums, Emigre, Lily &amp; The Witness Tree.  Does anyone know of her
and has she recorded anything else lately?

	So tell us what you thought!

	I liked it. It's a bit like a Prince ballad with M's falsetto 
	and the lush instrumentation (there's even some staccato harp), 
	but it's quite beautiful.

	And his devotion to Kate is quite obvious -- his intro to the 
	song is:

	"This next song we're about to do is a song written and produced

	on an album that came out I think seven or eight years ago, an 
	artist by the name of Kate Bush. I don't know if you all are 
	familiar with her (some applause and shouts) but she is the 
	bomb. Truly."

	Cool, huh?
