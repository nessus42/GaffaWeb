&gt;I recently saw a copy of This Woman's Work (CD - Japanese version) for
&gt;just over $200. Looked new, in shrink wrap.

&gt;I didn't buy it.

&gt;Is this a reasonable price???

&gt;I basically have all of the "regular" CD's already (a couple on LP) -
&gt;Is there any other way to get the "collectible" CD's? Or is TWW still
&gt;"the completist's curse"?

&gt;I am not by nature a collector, but that box had an awfully strange
&gt;allure...

Boy, does it EVER have allure.  I don't have that beautiful, enticing
black box either--and I'm missing many b-sides and rarities, too.  From
what I've heard, it IS worth having if you have just the "regular" albums
and don't own bunches of her singles.  The b-sides that I've heard at this
point are divine.  I almost want to get the box just so I can have The
Empty Bullring (flip of Breathing 7") on disc!!!!

Anyway, there's been a lot of talk about availability and pricing of 
TWW here.  And from what I've read and seen, $200 is too much.  I saw it
advertised in a very recent Goldmine for $145 + p&amp;p  (the English
version, I think) and in a local shop for $149.95 (the Japanese version). 
Also,there's a fellow who's had a used copy for sale here on gaffa for $120. 
I have a friend who manages a record store, and he says that the English
and the Japanese versions are very similar in price--often the Japanese is
a little less.  He thinks he can cut me a deal for the Jap in the $120 range.

ALSO, there was a posting a little while back that the box might come out
in the good ol' US of A.  It seems likely, but one wonders if it would
contain all the same stuff.  I, however, don't know if I can wait.

I was a huge, obsessive Kate fan back in my undergrad days in the early
80's, but her music has been kind of on the back burner for the last
decade or so while I've explored other "musics" in a variety of other
"phases"--e.g. my British psychedelia phase, my British folk-rock phase,
my world music phase, etc.  But a couple of weeks ago I had a transforming
experience!  I was in the shower and I started singing Kate songs.  All of
a sudden it hit me--I must have the TWW box!!!!  Since then it's become a
near obsession again.  Spooky.

QUESTION FOR YOU EXPERIENCED GAFFANS (I'm obviously a newbie):  What is the
difference between the European and Japanese issues of TWW, if any???? 
Any more news about the possibility of a domestic release?

Thanks!!!!!           Nancy N.
