Whoever wondered what I was talking about when I said I've listened to
the new songs (thanks, btw, to everyone involved with it), I posted something
to love-houns and that's without a d and so it came back to me but not to you
and anyhow, here it is again but let me just tell you that I've listened to the
songs - all three - again and my impression improves with every listen - that's
normally a very good sign, especially when you don't know when this raising
will stop and so there's even hope that the songs will reach heaven...

------8&lt;-------

I ftp'ed the three newest songs from the UK (8.6 KB/sec! faster than playing
it...) and have just listened to them. My impressions:

Rubberband Girl: Hmmm...
Eat The Music: Hmmm...
And So Is Love: ok...

The first two didn't impress me at all. Kate, where is your voice? Hopefully
only lost by the bad sound quality of 8 bit 8 kHz mono sound files. Hopefully.
If my impression doesn't change with the arrival of a more hifi version, then
I personally doubt that these songs will be very successful. I really hope
that it's just the low-fi, as it was with me and Moments Of Pleasure.

And So Is Love is a lot better IMHO, but it also isn't very 'charty' stuff.
I think I will like this song, but not as much as almost any PRE-Candle-In-
The-Wind song. [says he and just types cursor-up and enter to listen to ASIL
again.] Hmmm... maybe it is really ok.

Another thing about Kate's voice: I think it has lost its clear upper range.
She can sing high as before, but it sounds a bit more stressed and painful.
Kate, if you ever read this: STOP SMOKING! That can't be good.

Somehow until now I also miss anything that makes the new songs special. All
albums up to Hounds of Love were VERY special, in at least half of the songs.
The Sensual World didn't please me too much, but it wasn't bad either. [click,
cursor up, enter, click.] Some of the songs on TSW are not that special to
me until now, so I don't think this will change very much in future. I just
hope that there are more special songs on The Red Shoes again.

There's actually hope for me (at least until October 4th or so ;-) ), becaue
in the long run the four singles of Hounds of Love aren't what makes the
really special parts of that album.

[click, ctrl-c, cursor-up*~10, enter, click - Eat The Music is playing]

Jorn and whoever else was at the special promotion show of these four songs
in Chicago: Is the bass power due to some non-linearity in either recording
or playback or is it due to the real ting? The lower frequencies are VERY
prominent in each of the three songs.

Eagerly waiting,

Uli

Well, the Prince fans will like it.
