&gt;The most enjoyable part of the group was the breadth of the discussions,
&gt;ranging from the art debates to banjos to the Housemartins to Skinny Puppy
&gt;and Severed Heads. It encouraged me to try various groups that I never 
&gt;would have tried before, some I liked others I didn't. What has happened
&gt;to this group since then is mainly what has happened to to the rest of
&gt;Usenet... factionalization. Now reading Love-Hounds, I know that the
&gt;discussion has been sanitized to that of a particular genre of female
&gt;alternative/pop artists like Kate, Tori, Jane Siberry, etc. And even then
&gt;the Tori fans had to split off into their own mailing list because of
&gt;complaints of "too much Tori" in this group. 

Well, anytime an artist generates a *lot* of discussion, they deserve
their own mailing list anyway. Ok, maybe not the Utah Saints :-).
Of course, the same thing happened with Happy Rhodes, and I have to
say that as depressed as the "Happy wars" made me, it all turned out
for the best with the birth of Ecto. It *is* a place where we can
discuss everything from art, movies, books &amp; music (all kinds, though
yeah, it is focused on females) to the weather, abuse, African politics
and near-miss possible heart attacks (mine, yuk) and everything in 
between. Stuff that just can't be discussed on gaffa. I *love* Love-Hounds/
gaffa, but it is nice to have a place where I can talk about other things
that interest me without fear of getting flamed.

Is that a plug for Ecto? Sorta, but not really. I know that not everyone
would appreciate all the "extra" talk, or Happy's music, for that matter.
I just like to say every now and then how great I think Ecto is, and to
thank Love-Hounds/gaffa, without which Ecto wouldn't exist.

&gt;Not that there hasn't been some positive things happen. It's great to see
&gt;the Homeground crew on the net. Ron Hill has taken up much of the slack 
&gt;in IED's absence. And with no offense intended to the illustrious former
&gt;humble pseudo-moderator Doug, we don't have the interminable periods of
&gt;silence when Doug was too busy to moderate the group (which led to some
&gt;creative workarounds, such as the KTB group...but that's another story).
&gt;And although I've not had much to contribute for several years, and
&gt;my interests have drifted some, I still stay tuned in here to keep track
&gt;of all things Kate.

Absolutely! Kate *IS* God, after all!

Btw, I too appreciated the blast from the past, even though I wasn't
around the net then.

And I too wish that IED were back on a permanent basis.
