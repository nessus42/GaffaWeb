  I should perhaps start by saying that I didn't care much
for Suzanne Vega's "days of open Hand". Even saw the concert
twice, and was disappointed both times. Guess I was comparing
it too much to the fabulous tour after her second album.
I did, however, take immediately to 99 Fahrenheit when it came
out, and on the strength of that decided to give Open Hand
another try. I find I like it much better this time around.

--

  I was playing around with some new audio software on
my computer system this evening, and Open Hand happened to be in
the caddy at the time. While 'Men in a War' was playing, I happened
to switch the output sample rate down from the usual 44.1 KHz
down to 32 KHz -- effectively playing the song at 3/4 speed,
and dropping it down by about 3/4 of an octave. Sounds great!
Comes out in what sounds like a masculine voice, with the
words perfectly understandable, at quite a reasonable tempo.
As if sung by a guy who wasn't in a hurry to get through the
song. Gives a very interesting perspective, showing how a male
artist could do quite a reasonable 'cover' of some Vega songs.

  Those of you with Silicon Graphics Indigoes might want to do
this sort of playing yourself. For the rest of you... sorry,
it's kind of hard to demonstrate. I'd consider making a 15 or 20
second sound clip available to demonstrate to anonymous FTP, though.
