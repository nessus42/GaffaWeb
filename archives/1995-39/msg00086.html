Let's open today's Lovehounds, shall we?

Steve ZPJ &lt;zpj@huskbeat.demon.co.uk&gt; posts:

&gt;OK, I'll send it to everyone who wants it. Just email me for it, it's 
&gt;about 50k in JPEG format and it will be UUEncoded when I send it.
&gt;I'll add you to the list automatically Len, unless you don't want it 
&gt;in that format or something.

Sounds good, but remember, kids - DON'T POST BINARIES
TO LOVEHOUNDS!  Best bet - email it to someone with a
web page, have them put it up.  then email it to those poor
spuds out there who still have no Web access.

Eoin Armstrong &lt;mostrong@iol.ie&gt; sez:

&gt;The book is not really worth the read. It's a little pretentious and
&gt;Vermorel very often ends up describing her in a very sexual way: it's
&gt;almost embarrassing reading some of the passages. However from what I've
&gt;heard, it's certainly better than 'Princess of Surburbia', his first
&gt;book. This is affectionately known as 'Vermorels First Joke Book' and
&gt;'Kate Bush &amp; the Strange...' is known as the 'Second...'

&gt;I must admit, though, that there are some good photos in it - but it's
&gt;easily the worst biography of Kate's I have. 

I have to agree entirely here - the only thing worse than Fanboy drool
is PRETENTIOUS Fanboy drool.  Still, yeah, it has some really nice 
photos.

Unfortunately, this seems to be the most-available KateBooK.


Richard BREITNER &lt;ritchieb@worldnet.net&gt; asks:
 
&gt;Does anybody know how O(+&gt; and Kate did "Why should I love U" on
&gt;Kate's last release "The red shoes" ?

Yes.  Very horribly.

KateKnight &lt;103042.307@compuserve.com&gt; duhs:

&gt;Okay fellow worshippers, what would YOU like to see in a website 
&gt;devoted entirely to our beloved songstress (and NO ONE else)?

&gt;E-mail me. Because -

&gt;KATEMANIA is currently under construction.

Oh BOY!  The Ed Wood of Lovehounds is making his own
Web Page!  I can't wait!

"I Can't tour in 1996.  I'm too busy with playing with this
World Wide Web thing."
