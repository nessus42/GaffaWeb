Hello friends,
I don't know if anyone was faster with this, but better twice than nothing.
Today I received a Christmas newsletter (or how should I call this?) from
the KBC. It's two pages, one with pen pals and swaps, the other is a letter
from Kate. She has done a new song:

-------------
"Dear All,
I've been taking time off work this year and it's been really good for me.
I've still kept busy but I've also had lots of time to rest and catch up
things.
Many, many thanks for your continued support - I've had such positive
feedback from you about the last album and the film. I feel so priviledged
to have such nice people responding to my work.
I've just done a song for Donal Lunny who's putting an album together of
traditional Irish music. It was fun and very challenging.
The lyrics are in Gaelic so I will eagerly await comments from all
Irish-speaking listeners in particular. I'm sure Ma gave me a helping hand!
Much love to you, a very Happy Christmas and warm wishes for '96."
Kate x
--------------

Lisa added:
"There is no definite release date yet but it will hopefully be available
in or some time after March 1996. The title is to be "Common Ground (Celtic
Voices)" and it will be released by Premier Records which is part of EMI
Records. We understand that it will be available worldwide.
At present the artists appearing on this will be:
- Kate
- Sinead O'Connor
- Christy Moore
- Neil and Tim Finn (of Crowded House)
- Davey Spillane
- Sharon Shannon
- Elvis Costello
- Maire Brennan
- Andy Irvine
- Paul Brady
- Brian Kennedy
- Liam O'Maonlai (from Hothouse Flowers)

(There may be another couple of artists but as these will not be confirmed
until later this week, too late for the overseas Christmas posting
deadline, we thought we would get this off to you now.)

We will let you have further details when we have them in 1996 so don't
forget to make sure we have your replacement SAE's marked 12. 
(Overseas SAE + IRC)

Kate has also designed some charity Christmas cards for the Brian Eno
project "Warchild" we understand these are available from major outlets
including HMV stores. 

As I write this, it is snowing - long may it continue!
Have a great Christmas and I'll be in touch in '96.
All the best

Hey |&gt;oug, this is a nice pen pal for you: "Leigh Dulake, he's very much
into Kate, Madonna and a few other artists."

and: Jason Cuss, Castleford, W.Yorks is planning his 5th Kate party, called
"Northern Lights V". 

That's it.
best wishes
    Wieland
