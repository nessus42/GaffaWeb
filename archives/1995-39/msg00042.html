&gt; Well, I don't know anything about the article, but a few years ago at a
&gt; small college record store I found a really incredible Kate poster... It
&gt; has just her head &amp; shoulders and a whole bunch of leaves &amp; vines are
&gt; woven into her hair. On the top of the poster it says "The Secret History
&gt; of Kate Bush (&amp; the Strange Art of Pop)", and across the bottom "Fred
&gt; Vermorel". Is this from some book I don't know about? I just assumed it
&gt; was... Anyone?

'Kate Bush &amp; The Strange Art of Pop' was first published by the Vermorel
in 1983. It goes into the history of the Bush family (and goes back
several hundred years) and describes how Henry Bush, Kate's great-	
grandfather I think, died after falling into a ditch in a drunken stupor
in 1872.

The book is not really worth the read. It's a little pretentious and
Vermorel very often ends up describing her in a very sexual way: it's
almost embarrassing reading some of the passages. However from what I've
heard, it's certainly better than 'Princess of Surburbia', his first
book. This is affectionately known as 'Vermorels First Joke Book' and
'Kate Bush &amp; the Strange...' is known as the 'Second...'

I must admit, though, that there are some good photos in it - but it's
easily the worst biography of Kate's I have. 

Has anybody heard if Kate has started re-writing 'Leaving My Tracks'?

Mo.
