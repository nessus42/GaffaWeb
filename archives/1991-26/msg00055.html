Does anybody know much about this bands's albums?  I'm looking for a bit of
info...

I know the background of the band (such as the familial relations within the
band, and their relationship to Enya).  I also know they've been around for
quite a while (well over a decade).

Currently, I have _Macalla_ and _PastPresent_, both of which I bought about
a year ago.  Today, I bought _Fuaim_, on which Enya (Eithne) was a member
of the band.  I seem to remember reading a year or two ago that Enya was only
on this one album.  Is this true?  Currently, my favorite stuff by Clannad
is the traditional stuff with the Enya-esque wall of sound production.  I
love the sound of the beautiful female vocals meshing with the male.  In
that vein, I love the opening tracks of both _Macalla_ and _PastPresent_.
I was rather surprised, listening to _Fuaim_ that there really wasn't any
music like this...especially since not only was Enya on the album, but also
because it was produced by Nicky Ryan, who produced both of Enya's solo
albums.  In looking over the credits on _PastPresent_, I noticed that none 
of the albums on BMG which are represented on this best-of compilation
were produced by Nicky Ryan.  And yet it was these albums that contain the
songs with the sound I love so much.  I guess I'm just confused as to why,
when Enya and Nicky (and Roma!) Ryan were with the band, they sounded one
way, and when Nicky and Enya did solo work, it sounded the way Clannad did
without Nicky and Enya!

So, having spewed out all that, I guess what it comes down to is that my
next Clannad albums, assuming I can find them, will be _Legend_ and_Magical 
Ring_ (both represented on _PastPresent_).  But what of their other older
stuff?  How does it compare to _Fuaim_?

Well, 'nuff said about Clannad.  How did/are the KaTemas parties going?
Everyone having fun?
