Egads, I hate to start unusual rumors, but the earth shook last night
after I 'phoned and cranked the new Residents disk, _Freak Show_.

The Residents have a history of uncredited "guest" musicians appearing
on their albums, along with many rumors about these guests.  On the second
track, "Harry the Head," of the new disk, a woman sings a verse, and
she sounds, especially on some syllables, strikingly like your Fave.
Dead serious.

WARNINGs:
I do not recommend that you all Hound up the Residents disk.  Most people
do not like the Residents, 'cos the tunes are monsterweird.  Further,
a couple women are credited for doing vox on the album.  Third, though
the woman sounds strikingly like KB, she also sounds unlike her...kinda
weird.

Is there any LH out there who has intersecting interests in both the Rezzies
and KB who can help me with this?  I listened to it about twenty times,
and IMHO, it has about a twenty percent chance of being Kate Bush.  It sure
shocked me when it first came through.  Here they are singing a nice tune
about a head in a jar ("Harry...The head is dead") of formaldehyde, and
then, out of nowhere, this woman just pipes up.  If it is not KB, the 
singer sure has been influenced by her.

NOTE TO RESIDENTS FANS:
I cannot review new things by artists I really like until
I have heard them for a month or so, so please do not barrage me with
requests.  Briefly, the sound of the disk is heavy on electronics, with
more imaginative arrangements than _The King &amp; Eye_.  The vocals are
not unlike the recent Elvis/Hank Williams versions, but there are more
of the old-style main Resident vocals here than in the last few releases.
Female background vocals a la _God in Three Persons_ are prominent.
There are speed-altered voices, and there are some scary psychedelic
lyrics all over the place (see above), which make it at least a lot of
fun.  One thing's for sure: If they decide to tour with this one, there's
room for a mind-altering, wild show. 

The Main Theme (and the names of the opening/closing tracks):
"Everyone Comes to the Freak Show/But Nobody Leaves With a Smile"
