This was one of my first posts, back in 1989.  It hasn't seen much
circulation since then, so here it is again.  These are the reconstructed
real lyrics of TSW, straight from the last page and a half of James Joyce's
Ulysses.  (Thanks to Ryan (for the recipe) and Jeff Lueck for giving me my
first taste of seedcake (not out of their mouths, thank Kate!) at Katemas
Chicago, 1991!)


                      The Sensual World (restored)

MMMH, YES,
THEN I'D TAKEN THE KISS OF SEEDCAKE BACK FROM HIS MOUTH
..first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth
GOING DEEP SOUTH, GO DOWN, MMH, YES.
and it was leapyear like now yes
TOOK SIX BIG WHEELS AND ROLLED OUR BODIES
16 years ago my God
OFF OF HOWTH HEAD AND INTO THE FLESH, MMH, YES,
after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes
HE SAID I WAS A FLOWER OF THE MOUNTAIN, YES,
he said I was a flower of the mountain yes
BUT NOW I'VE POWERS O'ER A WOMAN'S BODY-- YES.
so we are flowers all a womans body yes [sic]...

TO WHERE THE WATER AND THE EARTH CARESS
..and Gibraltar as a girl where I
AND THE DOWN OF A PEACH SAYS MMH, YES,
was a flower of the mountain yes
DO I LOOK FOR THOSE MILLIONAIRES
when I put the rose in my hair
LIKE A MACHIAVELLIAN GIRL WOULD
like the Andalusian girls used
WHEN I COULD WEAR A SUNSET? MMH, YES,
or shall I wear a red yes
AND HOW WE WISHED TO LIVE IN THE SENSUAL WORLD
and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall
YOU DON'T NEED WORDS-- JUST ONE KISS, THEN ANOTHER.
and I thought well as well him as another

AND THEN THE ARROWS OF DESIRE REWRITE THE SPEECH, MMH, YES
and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes
AND THEN HE WHISPERED WOULD I, MMH, YES
and then he asked me would I yes
BE SAFE, MMH, YES, FROM MOUNTAIN FLOWERS?
to say yes my mountain flower
AND AT FIRST WITH THE CHARM AROUND HIM, MMH, YES
and first I put my arms around him yes
AND LOOSENED IT SO IF
and drew him down to me
IT SLIPPED BETWEEN MY BREASTS
so he could feel my breasts
HE'D RESCUE IT, MMH, YES,
all perfume yes
AND HIS SPARK TOOK LIFE IN MY HAND AND, MMH, YES
and his heart was going like mad and yes
I SAID, MMH, YES
I said yes
BUT NOT YET, MMH, YES
I will Yes
MMH, YES
