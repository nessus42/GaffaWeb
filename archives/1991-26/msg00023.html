&gt;QUESTIONS ON KATE BOOKS:
&gt;========================
&gt;
&gt;                What is the book on Kate Bush
&gt;         called the "Visual Documentary" like as 
&gt;         I have seen it in the shops and would like
&gt;         an opinion.. is it worth the 30 Aussie dollars
&gt;         that the shop asks?

&lt;tries to remember his Aussie-&gt;American conversion&gt;

Probably.  

I just got a copy from some friends in England who paid #8.95.  After shipping
and such I'll probably give each of the two friends who chipped in to buy
it in the first place around $12.  The book is fairly informative (though I
must admit that spending too much time reading gaffa makes most books seem
like old news...)  There are a lot of great photos and the layout is pretty
good.  My only complaints are that it came out far too early to include TSW,
and doesn't have enough color photos.  Anyway, I'd recommend this book to 
those with a chance to buy it.

&gt;               There also was a newer book on KaTe
&gt;         with a green front cover with Kate's face with flowers
&gt;         in her hair on it.
&gt;         I cannot recall the full title but it had the word
&gt;         SECRET in it in parenthesis. This book
&gt;         was smaller and 10 dollars cheaper.

AIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!  NO!  DON'T DO IT!

This book is "The Secret History of Kate Bush (&amp; the strange art of pop)"
by Fred Vermorel.  The book has one saving grace:  the cover contains one of
my two favorite pictures of KaTe (the other being the cover of TNW).  This
book is wretched.  I never would have bought it...my copy was a gift from
yet another friend who spent the summer in England a couple of years ago.

Jeff
