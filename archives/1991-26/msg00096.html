&gt;Enya is half-sister to Marie and yes Fuaim is the only album where she was an
&gt;"offical" member of the band she might have contributed some on others, I'm
&gt;not sure.

Ah.  I didn't realize she was "only" a half-sister.  Does that make Noel and
Padraig uncles by blood or by marriage?  ;-)


&gt;the first three being mainly traditional with little if any wall-o-sound
&gt;keyboards

Heh...with all the men in the band to sing harmony, it's more of a wall-o-vocal
cords!

&gt;I tend to preffer that to the later stuff.

I'e now listened to _Fuaim_ 3 times and I love it; it's just not what I 
expected.  It certainly wont' keep me from buying any of the other older
albums.

&gt;Even though Legend, Magical Ring, and Atlantic Realm are listed on PastPresent
&gt;I've never seen them in the stores (My copy of Magical Ring is a import that I
&gt;stumbled across in a used bin).

When I was in Olsson's buying _Fuaim_ I saw a copy of _Atlantic Realms_, but
I don't remember if it was an import or not.  I actually think it may have
been domestic.  I've seen _Magical Ring_ as a domestic, but that was most of
a year ago, and I haven't seen it since.

&gt;The earlier stuff is comming out on Shanachie
&gt;Records so far I've seen: In Concert, Fuaim, Clannad 2, Crann Ull and Dulaman 

This was what made me buy _Fuaim_.  I was out on the Great Residents Search
trying to find _Freak Show_ and either _The Speckless Sky_ or _The Walking_.
Olsson's had none of the three, but they had, much to my surprise, _Fuaim_.
The last time I saw _Fuaim_ at Olsson's was last August, and it was $24.
On Saturday I paid $15.  A pity that the album's only ~35 minutes.

I have this memory of also seeing a Clannad album dated 1990, as well as a 
CD single from the same time.  Anybody know anything about it?  This memory
could well be a figment; it's been known to happen.
