&gt; How's this compare with _Swollen_?  I've never seen/heard any HH other
&gt; than _Swollen_, although the Trouser Press Guide lists a couple. Is this 
&gt; sucker available on CD?  Label, catalog number?

It's not on CD and I believe it's out of print now. It's label is
Texas Hotel and the catalog number is 7. It was released in 1988.

I like it better than _Swollen_ and I *really* like _Swollen_! It's
not really an album, it's an EP. 
The songs are 1. Retarted Camel 2. Present (my favorite) 3. Sad Song
4. Catscan 5. Urgent 6. Hard On Lynda.

The line-up was different from _Swollen_. Lynda L. Limner/vocals &amp; bass,
Donna Y. Smith/keyboards &amp; backing vocals and Rene R. Garcia/percussion.
With help from...Evan Player/bass &amp; metal, Michael Meister/backing vocals
and Armistead Wellford/bass &amp; clarinet.

It was recorded in Athens, GA and produced by Lynda's brother, Michael
Stipe. Why is he so famous and she's so obscure? Damn! 
We almost rented Lynda's apartment when we moved up to Chicago. They were
moving to Florida and offered to give us theirs. Didn't work out though.

&gt; While I'm at it, I asked for opinions on Bel Canto _Birds of Prey_ on 
&gt; rec.music.misc and got no response.  I really like _White Out Conditions_;
&gt; should I get BoP?  Was it here that someone said BoP was very inferior to 
&gt; WOC?  What year was WOC released (there's no copyright on the CD)?

There's no date on my CD either, but at least it had the lyrics, which
the LP (which I bought first) didn't. I never ever listen to BOP. I like
a couple of songs, but I just don't think it's anywhere near as good as WOC,
which, IMHO, is a timeless classic. Get BOP if you're able to get a really
good deal at a used record shop is my advice. Her voice is worth a few bucks,
but the music isn't worth full price. I hope the next one is better.

Danm, I forgot to put Concrete Blonde on my DID list!
