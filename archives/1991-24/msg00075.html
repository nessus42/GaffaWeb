Chris here,

  Just catching up...

Vishal Markandey asked:
&gt;&gt; Indulge me if you please, by answering a rather whimsical question.
&gt;&gt; Imagine that you were to meet Kate and had an opportunity to talk to 
&gt;&gt; her. What would you think ? What would you say ? What would you talk
&gt;&gt; about ? (Besides "Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God..." :)

and D. J. Schaeffer replied:
&gt; Easy enough.  I'd tell her how much I enjoy her music and I'd ask her if I
&gt; could buy her a cuppa.
&gt;
&gt; (Of course, it's easy for me to say that now.  In reality, I'd probably
&gt; blurt out something like... "Marry me!")

   Speaking from experience..."Hi, Kate!" and "Hello."
     Vickie: "Hi...I thought you cut your hair."

Subject: Re: Squids?

&gt; Now here's a funny tale. It involves the bloke who is Vanilla Ice's UK
&gt; publicist - it's his job to sell Vanilla Ice - (deleted)
&gt; In his spare time he runs a record label (JSH Records) to release stuff so &gt; far by his own band 'The Hit Parade' who are obscure to a very major degree &gt; to the extent that most British fanzines don't write about him, let alone 
&gt; the music press. He'll play gigs for little more than transport cost 
&gt; apparently as he loves playing live. He also wrote arrangements for the 
&gt; Would-Be-Goods (on El records) who? (on who?) and generally puts a lot of 
&gt; effort into music where profit is the least likely thing he'll ever see.

   The concept of self-assigned penance springs to mind. (Hair shirts
being currently out of fashion.)

   By the way, just to clear one thing up...I wasn't comparing Record
Company Executives to squids. I was comparing the experence of dealing
with them to the _tactile_sensation_ of bathing in a tub full of squids.
   Sorry for any confusion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Ron, i hope you've got a quote or two explaining just why KaTe is 
&gt; dressed as She-Ra in the choruses -- not that i'm complaining, mind you...

  Why, that's the "Sprit of Feminiene Vengence!" Note the next to last
swing of the sword! Yikes! Severe anxiety!

&gt; while it may not be a 'killer' look, my favorite expression of
&gt; Kate's is that soft, slow, slightly sleepy smile that spreads
&gt; across her face at the end of "O England, My Lionheart" on the
&gt; Hammersmith video.
&gt; 
&gt; And for something completely and heart-stoppingly beautiful,
&gt; check out the video for "Delius."

   Faves here would be almost _any frame_ of "December Will Be Magic"
(Bongo version) or "Egypt" from the Christmas special.
