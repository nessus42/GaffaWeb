        Of course I am going to include a "full set" of Kate's quotes about
schooling.  Cloudbusting contain EVERYTHING she's ever said that I have access
to, with the exception of duplicate quotes.  The only question is WHERE to put
a specific quotes.  Quotes about kate's schooling obviously go in Part II- The
Story.  Quotes about Kate's religious feelings go in Part III - Subjects under
the Religion heading.  The only real question is does a particular quote about
a subject like religion also belong under the STORY part.  As it happens there
is one quotes there.  
        Anyway, I was asked if there were any quotes about Kate's feelings
about her school so here's a two sections from Cloudbusting 0.98B.  The first
couple ones are from the section while she's at school and the later ones are
from when she left school.  There are a couple more quotes inbedided in other
sections. 


        I think I was quite a shy person.  It was just a straight school. 
There wasn't much concern about self-expression in an artistic way.  There
were music and dancing clases, but there wasn't very much concentration on
that - it was much more on maths, biology.  I think I learnt a few things from
school which were useful, but generally it wasn't an environment that I felt I
could express myself in - because I was shy, I think.  (????,TWS)

        I found it wasn't helping me.  I became introvert.  I guess it was the
teacher's system, the way they react to pupils, and I wasn't quite responsive
to that.  (1978, March, Melody Maker)

        I was unhappy at school and couldn't wait to leave.  (????,AVD)

        It's difficult for me to go back that far but I was quite shy.  I was
just a girl growing up.  I learnt a few things from school which were useful,
but generally it wasn't an environment I felt I could express myself in.  It
was just a straight school.  (????,AVD)


YOU GOT LOT OF "O" LEVELS, YOU GOT 10. [KATE LAUGHS] SEEMS LIKE A WORLD RECORD
TO ME.
        How did you know that? 
        OH, I KNOW A LOT OF THINGS.  [KATE LAUGHS] DID YOU ALWAYS WANT A
MUSICAL CAREER IN SPITE OF ALL THOSE QUALIFICATIONS? 
        Yes, I did.  I've always wanted to be involved in music.  I never
thought I'd actually be able to sing them, sing my songs.  But it seems that
I've done it.
        WELL, I DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE COULD DO THEM REALLY.  YOU LEFT SCHOOL
AT 16, WHAT DID YOU DO AS SOON AS YOU LEFT SCHOOL? 
        Well I started training as a dancer, because it seemed very
complimentary to the music, and I just didn't want to waste my days doing
nothing.  (1979, Ask Aspel)

        NOW YOU CAME AWAY FROM SCHOOL WITH TEN "O" LEVELS, SO DOES THAT MEAN
YOU WERE A VERY ATTENTATIVE PUPIL?
     I think i've just found the whole system of school something that didn't
really appeal to me - I couldn't really express myself in that whole system.
     SO, PRESUMABLY, YOU'RE FAVORITE LESSON WAS MUSIC?
     I did enjoy music and english, but, I just didn't really enjoy school as
I got older.
        WHY WAS THAT?
     It's very hard to say, um, I just...
     IT'S VERY RESTRICTIVE, WASN'T IT?
     Yes, I think I did find it restrictive.
     RIGHT, SO YOU COULDN'T GET AWAY QUICK ENOUGH?
     Well, at that point in my life, I really did want to leave school. 
(1985, Conversation Series 1)

        It was what I wanted to do.  I didn't want to go to University so I
didn't see any point in staying on.  (????,TWS)

    The idea of university just loomed like a really sinister thing. I
couldn't face it. I was lucky - something came up and took my mind off it. 
(1987, KBC 21)

        NEVERTHELESS, KATE QUIT SCHOOL AT THE AGE OF 16 WITH 10 "O" LEVELS,
SPECIALIZING IN ENGLISH AND MUSIC AND SHOWING AN UNUSUAL INTEREST IN LATIN,
ALTHOUGH SHE FOUND IT AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT LANGUAGE TO MASTER. 
        The reason I left was that I felt I could do something more in tune
with my purpose - music.   (1978, March, Melody Maker)

        I felt the only reason to stay in school was to take and get exams ...
after O levels, I felt I just didn't want to go on... (????,TWS)

        My parents wern't keen on the giving up of school at the beginning to
go into singing and dancing but once they saw I was serious about it they gave
support.
        I was quite stubborn about my decision and in the end they realized it
was for the best.   (C.1980, Music is my life)

    I definitely *became* a person when I left school and suddenly took
control of my life.  I felt like that was the first time I'd really been
there.  Do you. . .?  It was the beginning of my life really.  (1989, Q)
