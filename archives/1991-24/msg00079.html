 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: MisK.

   To answer Scott Borst's question about what "official" releases
by Kate Bush were _not_ included in the boxed set, here are all the
legitimate Kate Bush tracks that are missing, as far as IED knows:

   Dreamtime (The Dreaming instrumental/remix)
   Running Up That Hill (instrumental)
   The Sensual World (instrumental)
   The Man With the Child in His Eyes (single mix, with spoken intro)
   Army Dreamers (single mix, with longer, non-fadeout ending)
   The Big Sky (The Special Single Mix, with re-mixed opening bars)
   This Woman's Work (original soundtrack album mix, with spoken words)
   This Woman's Work (Special Single Mix)
   Be Kind to My Mistakes (original soundtrack album version, much longer and
               than and very different from the single re-mix)
   The Confrontation (instrumental from the Comic Strip film, GLC)


In addition, here are some other tracks that EMI has no very good
excuse for not having included in the box set, in IED's opinion:

   Three other pieces of music heard in the GLC film and thus officially made
               public but never released on a record
   Brazil (cover of old standard pop song from unreleased soundtrack
               album, it was originally scheduled for release and was
               certainly available to EMI for inclusion, but they just
               didn't want to take the trouble)
   The Wedding List (live, Prince's Trust Gala film, released on video)
   Running Up That Hill (live, Amnesty International's Policeman's Third
               Ball film, released on video and CD)
   Breathing (live, Comic Relief's Ha! Ha! Ha! soundtrack album)
   Do Bears Sh... in the Woods? (live duet with Rowan Atkinson, Comic
               Relief's Ha! Ha! Ha! soundtrack album)
   Cloudbusting (video re-mix with extra music, from the official video)
   Maybe (early demo which Kate played part of on BBC Radio)
   Babooshka demos (2 demos which Kate played parts of on BBC Radio)

   Add to the above all the scores of early demo masterpieces which
proliferate in terrible bootleg dubs; all the guest vocals Kate has
done on other people's records; all the other amazing live performances,
including the complete soundtrack from the Hammersmith Odeon film; plus
God knows what other jewels in the EMI vaults that are just gathering dust...

   To continue the list of Love-Hounds' favorite Kate Bush video clips,
IED's three favorites (preferred over any of the official videos) are
Ran Tan Waltz (from the BBC Kate special), Army Dreamers (the Mrs. Mopp
version, from RockPop, German television), and Experiment IV (the
Wogan Show lip-synch version).
