I said:

&gt;&gt; I find it rather depressing that, after the ordeal, she now
&gt;&gt; has knowledge of a future she cannot change - and is still fated to walk
&gt;&gt; down that path.

And Alan replied..

&gt;What's depressing about knowing you're going to live until you're old and
&gt;have two children? I'd have thought that was a very happy and inspiring
&gt;thought - at least she would know she has to make the best of her life
&gt;from that point onwards because these two children will be dependent upon
&gt;her when they are born.

&gt;And it isn't necessarily that her life will be predetermined... all she
&gt;sees of it is herself and the two children... that leaves so much to the
&gt;imagination so there's plenty of things that could happen to her without
&gt;her knowing about them beforehand... who is the children's father and
&gt;what happens to him? What happens to all of the people already in her
&gt;life?

I'm just commenting on having the foreknowledge of her life, and not whether 
the circumstances will be positive or negative.  The 'depressing' part (for 
me) is *knowing* that your path is predetermined - *knowing* that humans are 
all really just unwitting actors.  While we would feel like we can make 
decisions that have an impact on our lives, she would know the truth - the 
script has already been written.  Those without that knowledge can at least 
delude themselves.

Which is why I would prefer the skater's death - then it was just the 
*potential* of her future weighing in her mind, and not something she was 
fated to live through.  However, I have a feeling that this is her actual 
destiny speaking to her, and that the narrator lives - the details are 
pretty specific here.

Doesn't mean it's true, though!
