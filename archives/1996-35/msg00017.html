Hi!

&gt; I guess I can be called one of the breed of KaTe Bush fans. I am fourteen,
&gt; live in Australia and bought Hounds of Love (about when it came out), some
&gt; time ago I know, and have lster bought all her albums. To reply to an
&gt; earlier message, my dad also loves KaTe Bush, aparrently he went to her
&gt; only concert MANY years ago.

You really bought Hounds of Love when you were 3 years old?! Wow!

Not to deillusionise you, but did your father go to Europe for that concert?
For there were no concerts of Kate outside of Europe, and that was back in
1979.

&gt; Anyway, I bought The Red Shoes in a red box with a gold string, a pair of
&gt; small red shoes and a certificate. There are 500 made and I was wondering
&gt; if I am just lucky, or if everyone has it. Thanks.

Well, it's not that these boxes (there are several of them) are easy to find.
But since most of them are not official, they're not real collector's items
as well. The album in the box is a perfectly regular album, and the box is
by someone else. Hey, even *I* could buy some cardboard boxes, some red
dance shoes, some golden strings, print some certificates, and buy some
regular albums and sell them.

It might be the case that you have one of the few real EMI promo shoe boxes,
in which case the box would be worth something, but from your description
it doesn't sound so. As far as I know there's only one official box
containing a pair of shoes, and that box is too small to hold a CD, not even
a 3" CD single, for the shoes are about size -3... The other official boxes
do as far as I know not contain shoes. There is an Australian official box
containing a video tape, that'd be quite interesting for a collector.

All official boxes are promo items by the way.

Bye,

Uli
