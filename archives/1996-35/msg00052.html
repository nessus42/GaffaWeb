&gt; Subject: Talk to me about the Ninth Wave
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Kate Fans,
&gt; 
&gt;      Is there one coherent plot behind the 9th wave? People usually
&gt; mention that it's about a drowning woman, but I've not seen a
&gt; discussion of the individual songs with respect to this drowning
&gt; motif.  Is there an "accepted" exegesis?
&gt; 
&gt;      My primary interest is what a third person, omniscent observer
&gt; would see when watching the drowning woman. My assumption, which is
&gt; quite open to objection, is that there IS an underlying set of
&gt; physical events, a "timeline," along which the highly personal events
&gt; described in the songs can be placed. This is a coarse outline:
&gt; 
&gt;      And Dream of Sheep  ----  In the boat, she falls asleep
&gt;      Under Ice           ----  A dream; the storm arrives
&gt;      Waking the Witch    ----  Wakes up, finding herself sinking
&gt;      Watching you w/o me ----  In the face of death, 1) Grief
&gt;      Jig of Life         ----                        2) Struggle
&gt;      Hello Earth         ----                        3) Acceptance
&gt;      Morning Fog         ----  The moment of her dying.
&gt; 
&gt;      What follows are some SPECULATIONS (not proofs) regarding these
&gt; matters; they are thoughts that I jotted down after having read the
&gt; "most-lyrics" file a few times. It's not my primary intention to offer
&gt; a coherent story; it is rather to start a discussion.  Anything I have
&gt; put in quotations is from the song itself.
&gt; 
&gt; AND DREAM OF SHEEP 
&gt; - ------------------
&gt; The woman is on a boat, and waiting for rescue, since a storm is
&gt; approaching. "Little light shining"---this is presumably a light on her
&gt; boat, which "will guide them [the rescuers] to"  her. Hence her "face is
&gt; all lit up." She is afraid the the potential rescuers might "take [her]
&gt; for a buoy," so she is "racing white horses,"  i.e., her boat is moving
&gt; with respect to the white foam on the tip of the waves, so that she will
&gt; not appear stationary, and be mistaken for a buoy.
&gt; 
&gt; She wishes to sleep out the storm, because she is afraid of it; she
&gt; wants to be "weak" and "dream of sheep" rather than to have to go
&gt; through the ordeal.  The radio says "Gale east," announcing the
&gt; storm. She is worried that she might miss her rescuers, but reassures
&gt; herself that she'll "wake up to the sound of engines." She tunes in on
&gt; people talking to each other on their two-way radios, and wishes that
&gt; she hadn't left hers back on the shore. Finally, sleep overcomes her.
&gt; 
&gt; UNDER ICE
&gt; - ---------
&gt; This song is very likely the dream she has while asleep on the boat.
&gt; She talks about herself as if she is observing a past self. "I'm
&gt; speeding past trees"---this is as detached as her first person
&gt; narrative gets, and it is in this detached style that people usually
&gt; recount their dreams.
&gt; 
&gt; Presumably, while she is having this dream, the storm overtakes her
&gt; boat, and capsizes it. We know from personal experience that, even
&gt; though certain dreams appear to occur over a period of hours or even
&gt; days for the dreamer, the actual physical time that passes for an
&gt; outside observer (say, for a neurologist monitoring the dreaming) can
&gt; be as short as minutes or even seconds. Thus, it is entirely plausible
&gt; that this song, as well as the beginning of the next, occur during the
&gt; few seconds in which the woman's boat is sinking.
&gt; 
&gt; In the following songs, the discrepancy between "real time" (of an 
&gt; observer watching the drowning woman) and "personal time" (of the
&gt; woman, seeing scenes from her life go by) increases.
&gt; 
&gt; WAKING THE WITCH
&gt; - ----------------
&gt; This song does the best job of resisting any imposition of a "plot"
&gt; onto the Ninth Wave. Even if the witch in the song is being drowned
&gt; (see below), we are very far away from the "real world" where the
&gt; protagonist is drowning. We have here deeply penetrated the woman's
&gt; psyche. A further complication arises from the line, "We are of the
&gt; going water and the gone. We are of water in the holy land of water."
&gt; The air of mysticism in this phrase helps connect the water with the
&gt; witch-motif of the song. However, it also removes us a little from the
&gt; protagonist.  We can more easily identify with a woman who is
&gt; drowning, and thinks of her loved ones; it is perhaps more difficult
&gt; to identify with a woman who communes with water-spirits.
&gt; 
&gt; The song nevertheless contains important direct references to the
&gt; drowning theme. The most clear instance is the last line, apparently
&gt; shouted down at the ocean from a helicopter, "Get out of the waves!
&gt; Get out of the water!" We can understand this line as reality
&gt; "breaking into" the witch-trial world of the woman. This is consistent
&gt; with the hypothesis that the witch trial is yet another (very 
&gt; hallucinatory) dream---perhaps a waking dream the woman is having as
&gt; she realizes that she is caught in the water.
&gt; 
&gt; A more minor examples is "There's a stone around my leg." Perhaps the
&gt; witch is being drowned instead of being burned or stabbed; the
&gt; distorted male voice says at one point "You won't burn... you won't
&gt; bleed... go down!"
&gt; 
&gt; WATCHING YOU WITHOUT ME
&gt; - -----------------------
&gt; With this song we are again on firmer ground. After the initial
&gt; struggle, the drowning woman's first thoughts turn to her loved
&gt; ones. They are at home, waiting for her to come back from her boat
&gt; ride; "I should have been home Hours ago, But I'm not here. But I'm
&gt; not here."  Note that the "You" in this song could be either singular
&gt; or plural.  Perhaps it is her lover; really any loved one could be
&gt; substituted here.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of my favorite Kate lines are in this song. "Can't let you know
&gt; What's been happening. There's a ghost in our home, Just watching you
&gt; without me." She is drowning and almost dead; she is the ghost that
&gt; occupies the home of her loved ones. She haunts their home because she
&gt; is thinking of the home; her thoughts occupy it. She is there in
&gt; thought, but ultimately not in reality.
&gt; 
&gt; THE JIG OF LIFE
&gt; - ---------------
&gt; Part of her wants to give up the struggle---and dream of sheep, I
&gt; presume, i.e., let herself drown. Then she has a vision of her
&gt; future---an "old lady," the lady she could be if she survives the
&gt; accident.  This vision of a possible future takes life in her mind as
&gt; the waters begin to overwhelm her, and begins to beg for its right
&gt; to exist---"C'mon and let me live, girl!"
&gt; 
&gt; The second part of this song is puzzling to most of us, I'm sure.  It
&gt; can perhaps be argued that the male voice in this song is a call to
&gt; the woman to resign her life, i.e., the voice of death. This is the
&gt; evidence as far as I see it. He says "Catch us now for I AM your
&gt; future." Earlier in this song, we saw one possible future for the
&gt; drowning woman---the future where she would survive, have children,
&gt; and grow old. The most obvious other alternative, is the future where
&gt; she drowns and therefore is dead.  The female voice thus comes to
&gt; represent life, the male voice its antithesis. Also, his proposal to
&gt; wait for the time "when the lifespray cools" in an "empty world" seems
&gt; to point to this interpretation. However the solution is not a very
&gt; attractive one, and I hope someone can come up with a better one.
&gt; 
&gt; HELLO EARTH
&gt; - -----------
&gt; Once again we seem to be in trouble. What is she doing on the Space
&gt; Shuttle?  Perhaps she is imagining things she would like to do, but no
&gt; longer can. "With just my heart and my mind I can be driving, Driving
&gt; home, And you asleep On the seat." Obviously, she is drowning, so she
&gt; can't &gt;actually&lt; drive home; but instead she settles for doing it with
&gt; just her heart and her mind, settles for being with her loved ones in
&gt; her imagination.
&gt; 
&gt; Similarly, then, she is orbiting the earth in her imagination, and
&gt; in her imagination blotting it out of sight. I am reminded of 
&gt; "In Search of Peter Pan," on _Lionheart_: "When I am a man I will
&gt; be an astronaut, and find Peter Pan."
&gt; 
&gt; She is resigned to her fate. She calls the tempest "Murderer!" and
&gt; asks herself "Why did I go?"---why did she leave her loved ones
&gt; behind.  The choruses signal the approaching moment of her death. The
&gt; last lines in German, "Deeper, deeper, somewhere in the depths there
&gt; is a light..." also point to the idea that she is sinking.
&gt; 
&gt; THE MORNING FOG
&gt; - ---------------
&gt; Does she drown or is she rescued? The value of this song to me 
&gt; increased dramatically when I began to consider the possibility that
&gt; she does not make it, that this song is an expression of her last
&gt; state of consciousness before she breathes out her spirit. Let's 
&gt; look at lyrics for the evidence in either direction.
&gt; 
&gt;           SHE LIVES                          SHE DROWNS
&gt;   -------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;                                           Begin to bleed,
&gt;       Begin to breathe,
&gt;       begin to speak.
&gt;       D'you know what?
&gt;       I love you better now.
&gt;                                           I am falling
&gt;                                           Like a stone,
&gt;                                           Like a storm,
&gt;                                           Being born again
&gt;                                            Into the sweet morning fog.
&gt; 
&gt;                                           I am falling,
&gt;                                           And I'd love to hold you now.
&gt; 
&gt;                        I___   kiss the ground
&gt;                        I___   tell my mother,
&gt;                        I___   tell my father,
&gt;                        I___   tell my brothers,
&gt;                        How much I love them.
&gt; 
&gt; I feel that a lot depends on what contraction is used after the "I" in
&gt; the last five lines. If she is falling, and would love to hold her
&gt; loved one, that means that she can't do it---she is drowning, and her
&gt; imminent death has sparked this enormous love for everyone she is
&gt; close to.
&gt; 
&gt; The "most-lyrics" file has the last few lines listed as "I'll kiss...
&gt; I'll tell I'll tell, etc..." However, when I listen to the song, it
&gt; sounds ambiguous to me. It could well be "I'd kiss the ground, I'd
&gt; tell my brothers, How much I love them." The "would"-form goes towards
&gt; supporting the theory that she does in fact drown; the "will"-form
&gt; perhaps supports the other extreme.
&gt; 
&gt; To me, The Ninth Wave has a lot more aesthetic value if the woman does
&gt; drown. This is not because I hate her or anything, but simply because
&gt; in this context the last song grows in emotional power. She looks
&gt; death in the face, and her last thought is that she is a richer person
&gt; for her ordeal---that she loves more, and loves better.
&gt; 
&gt; - ---------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; In any case, even if you completely disagree with everything I've
&gt; said here, please let me know your feelings towards the Ninth Wave
&gt; as a story.
