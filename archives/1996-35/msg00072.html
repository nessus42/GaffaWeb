     This one seems set to run forever!  Here's my contribution.
     
     KaTe connections - every person I have been out with has had a KaTe 
     connection.  My current partner has been into KaTe from the beginning, 
     like me.  We first connected through my KaTe sale/auction about three 
     years ago.  Nothing further until the 1994 Convention when he happened 
     to be the one person who sent some photos of the event to me following 
     me placing an ad. for same in a KaTe fanzine.  We then met fleetingly 
     via some mutual former friends quite by chance early 1995; got into a 
     lengthy correspondence through the year, met about three times and 
     then "BAM!" last Samhain.  Our KaTe linked lives are now joined, KaTe 
     photographs and paintings adorn the walls of our humble dwelling unit, 
     KaTe music plays on the tape deck, KaTe videos frequently find their 
     way into the video player.  My personal view is that when you are into 
     KaTe's music and the whole KaTe "thing" as much as I am, it just 
     wouldn't work to have the closest of relationships with someone who 
     wasn't similarly touched by her art.  There would always be a big part 
     of you they could never understand.  My motto is, if you find someone 
     who is into KaTe, then they will probably have an awful lot of other 
     things in common with you too.  I think a great many people would have 
     to agree with that one.
     
     Brightest Blessings
