I am so envious of the luck of some people who have partners who love KT. I 
used to share my joy with my best friend with whom I discovered TKI when we 
were both sixteen, but he's been in Thailand for 8 years! Since then the KT 
sharing has been very sparse - until I discovered this list. There has been 
only one other notable time where the joy of sharing came through, and that 
happened two months ago. I was sitting in a bar with some friends when 
beside me I heard a young chap (only 19) mention KT and I turned around and 
asked "How much do you know of her stuff" and he said "ALL OF IT!" Needless 
to say neither of us spoke to anyone else for the next two hours and I'm 
ashamed to say (althoug it was great at the time) that we bored our 
respective friends stupid as we sang and sang and sang KT songs from every 
album, doing the harmonies where we could and ending up soul buddies for 
life! Has anyone else had such a thing happen - especially with someone from 
the 'next generation' of KT fans, so to speak? Whereas I usually am not 
impressed with the under 25's these days (what an old stick in the mud) this 
was really impressive - I mean, she's hardly top-20!

&gt;For once I feel like a lucky Kate fan. My wife and I discovered Kate at the
&gt;same time (though at different locations). ....
