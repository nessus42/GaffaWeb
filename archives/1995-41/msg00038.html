Hi, everybody.  I just saw that I sent this with an email error and
that may be why this didn't get posted.  So I'm going to go ahead and
send this again and if you got two, well it's a fun post anyway.  :)
Happy new year, everybody!



Hi, Lovehounds!  Well my schedule really got busy.  But I've finally
finished tabulating some of the questions and what I'll do is post
part of it now.  Then later, I'll post the whole thing, (this will be
good for those who may not be able to read rmg over the holidays). So
thanks in advance for your patience with all the bandwidth.

I'm not breaking the tie on this one (since it's number one and since
these are the only songs that received more than one vote).  Songs
that were voted as least liked but never voted as anyone's 20
favorites or any other category:

Why Should I Love U (Her collaboration with Prince)
Full House
Shoedance (Extended mix of "The Red Shoes")
Not This Time
Dreamtime (Instrumental to "The Dreaming")

2.  Candle In The Wind					   5
3.  The Man I Love					   4

FAVORITE GUEST APPEARANCES

1.  Don't Give Up (a duet with Peter Gabriel, on his album "So")	11
2.  Do Bears . . . ?  (a duet with Rowan Atkinson from Utterly,
Utterly Live:  Comic Relief)					  4
3.  The Seer (a guest vocal on Big Country song from their album of
the same title)							  3

						    				
While I'm the conductor of this poll, and would like to be attributed
for conducting it, I consider this poll to be the property of all
Lovehounds and who have my permission to include these results on
their pages if they wish (especially since I don't have one).  Of
course, this poll will also be in the general archives.    

Total number of Lovehounds this time around-- 27  (We'll do better the
next time someone runs one of these.)

All ties were broken first by anyone who wanted to change their votes
or vote for more songs (indicated by an asterisk), then by number of
people who voted on the song, and then by a flip of a coin.  (All
tails in the air but when the penny landed it's still dancing . . .
argh!  Got to get a better coin and one not so evil!  :) 

Titles with slashes indicate different titles given for the same demo
recording.  Versions featured with a number of votes represent a
minority.

Commentary on the results:  It appears that eighteen years after the
fact,  "Wuthering Heights" is STILL the Lovehounds' favorite, her most
successful single to date.   "Cloudbusting" clearly won by a landside,
with Kate's retelling of Peter Reich's "A Book Of Dreams" and the
guest star of Donald Sutherland.  When it came down to minialbums,
"The Ninth Wave" beat "The Dreaming."  The winners of least liked
songs clearly had some disagreement with other Love Hounds since all
three of the tunes are featured on the top 100,  Kate's covers of both
Elton John tunes captured almost half of the voters, period.  And
while Kate has guested more often than we seem to remember, "Don't
Give Up" is our favorite, hands down.  Much to my surprise, no one
voted for her duet with Midge Ure ("Sister and Brother"), but that's
what happens when one choice is available, I guess.

The rest will be displayed after New Years'.  A BIG THANK YOU  to all
who voted, and also thanks to Robert Little (are you still out there?)
for his contribution, early on.  I am very curious how this poll rests
compared to the Lovehound Conventions' poll from last year.  I'm sure
tastes can change over time.  :)   And Happy Holidays to everybody!
Especially since December Will Be Magic Again!
