Archive-name: music/kate-bush-faq-diffs
Last-modified: 1995/12/28
Version: 1.3.v minus 1.3.u

This is a human understandable 'diff' from previous month's FAQ to this
month's FAQ.

If you are on the mailing list (love-hounds) instead of rec.music.gaffa this
is all you will get without further action.  The full version is posted to
rec.music.gaffa only.  You can get a full copy of the FAQ by requesting it from
me (uli@zoodle.robin.de).  If you subscribe to the list (done by sending
email to love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net) Bill Wisner will also provide you
with the full FAQ.  If you can't receive more than 64KB in one piece I can
split the FAQ for you.

All paragraphs which have been changed/added/deleted are listed here,
additional comments in []s.  Cosmetical changes aren't listed.


Finally I caught up with my almost-12000-emails backlog of the last three
months.  Since the habit of posting the RFAQs weekly has somehow stopped
already (anyone missing them?), I'll include the whole section of RFAQs
in here.  There's also a new one (the last), though not by Stev0, so the
humor is somehow missing.

-------------------8&lt;-------------------

0.   Really Frequently Asked Questions

     Also known as 'Read Before Posting'.  Please excuse stev0's [SB] humor...

     Q:  What does "Gaffa" mean?
     A:  Duct tape. [see also 1.1.]

     Q:  When will Kate tour again?
     A:  Never.  Ever.  Really. [see also 4.2.]

     Q:  What is Kate saying at the end of "Leave it Open"?
     A:  "We let the weirdness in" [see also 5.5.]

     Q:  What is the words of that spoken word part in "Jig of Life"?
     A:  You don't want to know.  Trust me.

     Q:  What is the best album in the entire history of Creation?
     A1: The Dreaming.  Anyone who disagrees is an asshole.
     A2: Hounds of Love.  Anyone who disagrees is an asshole.

     Q:  Should I post binaries to rec.music.gaffa?
     A:  NOOOOOO!!!!!!!! [see also 1.4.]

     Q:  When is Kate's next album coming out?
     A:  Your guess is as good as mine.

     Q:  What are the URLs to some Kate Web pages.
     A:  <A  HREF="http://american.recordings.com/WWWoM/cgi-bin/ubl?card+1032">http://american.recordings.com/WWWoM/cgi-bin/ubl?card+1032</A>
         [see also 4.11.]

     Q:  Hey!  The episode of "Saturday Night Live", hosted
         by Eric Idle, in which Kate was the musical guest,
         doesn't have Kate on the tape I got!  Was I ripped off?
     A:  Yes [see also 4.1.]

     Q:  Which is better, the British, Japanese, or Canadian Boxed Set?
     A:  You'll just have to get all of them and decide for yourself.
         [see also 4.4.]

     Q:  Is it OK to talk about other artists on Lovehounds?
     A:  Yes.  It is encouraged. [see also 1.1.]

     Q:  Even at length?
     A:  Yes.  Well, don't go TOO far - posting multi-megabyte discographies is
         frowned on (and yes, people have done that).  Use your judgement.
         [see also 1.1.]

     Q:  Can I even talk about Tori Amos?
     A:  Yes, you can even talk about Tori Amos. [see also 2.2.]

     Q:  What about Happy Rhodes?
     A:  Er, that will be all for today... [see also 2.1.]

     Q:  What to do about spam postings?
     A:  A few things.  [see also 3.3.]



2.1. Who is Happy Rhodes?

[...]
        The Keep                ?               13.99

[There's a new Happy Rhodes album out there.]

2.2. Who is Tori Amos?

[really-deep-thoughts is up and running again!]

     Tori will have a new album (called "Boys for Pele") out in January, so
     watch out for those singles again!

[yeah!]

     There now also is the second Big-8 newsgroup for a female artist, called
     rec.music.tori-amos, though it's (unlike love-hounds and r.m.gaffa)
     not connected with the mailing list.

[Big-7 -&gt; Big-8 - don't forget humanities.* !]

2.3. Other mailing lists that might be of interest

     Loreena McKennitt - Old Ways

        subscribe: old-ways-request@lists.mindspring.com
                   Body: subscribe
        post:      old-ways@lists.mindspring.com

[up again, has a new address]

3.3. Spam postings

     What is a spam?
	
     A spam is a commercial posting in a forum where it's not wanted.  That's
     most of the times selling things or services that have (in our case)
     nothing to do with Kate Bush or even music.  Most spams also appear in
     a whole lot of places all at once.  Someone selling a few Kate Bush
     records is definitely not a spam.  A professional record dealer selling
     more than a few records is also not a spam.  (Nevertheless both should
     avoid posting long sales list to the group.  Instead post an announcement
     that you've got stuff to sell and will send the list to interested
     people.))  A 'student' praising magazine subscriptions most definitely is
     a spam.
	
     What to do about spam postings?

     1. Write to the relevant postmasters (politely, they're likely to have
        hundreds if not thousands of similar mails), possibly including the
        complete spam posting including *all* headers (esp. "Received:" lines).
     2. Do not mailbomb the originator.  Most of the times, the addresses
        are faked, that is, the only one not having trouble with the mail
        bomb is the spammer himself.
     3. Do not write to love-hounds/rec.music.gaffa, we all know it as well
        as you do.
     4. With repeated spams, check out with the maintainers of our moderator
        software &lt;love-hounds-request@uunet.uu.net&gt;.  They might be able to do
        something about it.
     5. Most important: do not call/write/ask/whatever the originator about
        whatever he wants to offer to you.  That's what he wants to achieve,
        and that might be what's paying him (addresses = information = money).
        You can complain if you know who he is, but please: do not play into
        his hands.

     See also the net-abuse newsgroups (news.admin.net-abuse.misc etc.).

     P.S.: to be a bit more PC: spammers could be female as well...

     On to a more friendly subject:

[A totally new section, I hope people with more knowledge agree with my
suggestions here.  Bill et al, I presume that you *can* do something
about spam postings, as soon as a certain posting is known as a spam,
am I right?  I'm also only hinting at our spam filter - don't advertise
it, so that noone might get the idea of thinking to get around it.

I'm also lying now, for section 1.3. says "Be assured again that no article you write is thrown away due to its contents or your person." But I stand up to
this one.]

3.4. What is Katemas?

[new section number, and indeed a more friendly subject]

4.1. Kate Bush - her career and Kate as a human being

     Yes, she appeared on Saturday Night Live on December 9, 1978 (With
     host Eric Idle of Monty Python fame), but the tape you can purchase of
     that show has her edited out!  Yes, that's Donald Sutherland in the
     Cloudbusting video.  No, we don't have her home address, though we
     know that she has just bought a house in Reading.

[half-sentence about the house in Reading added.]

4.4. Basic Discography/Videography

     The latest KBC newsletter (#11) brought the following info from Kate
     herself (brought to you by [WW]):

        Dear All,
        I've been taking time off work this year and it's been really good for
        me.  I've still kept busy but I've also had lots of time to rest and
        catch up things.
        Many, many thanks for your continued support - I've had such positive
        feedback from you about the last album and the film.  I feel so
        priviledged to have such nice people responding to my work.
        I've just done a song for Donal Lunny who's putting an album together
        of traditional Irish music.  It was fun and very challenging.
        The lyrics are in Gaelic so I will eagerly await comments from all
        Irish-speaking listeners in particular.  I'm sure Ma gave me a helping
        hand!
        Much love to you, a very Happy Christmas and warm wishes for '96.
        Kate x

        Lisa added:
        There is no definite release date yet but it will hopefully be
        available in or some time after March 1996.  The title is to be ommon
        Ground (Celtic Voices)" and it will be released by Premier Records
        which is part of EMI Records.  We understand that it will be available
        worldwide.
        At present the artists appearing on this will be:
        - Kate
        - Sinead O'Connor
        - Christy Moore
        - Neil and Tim Finn (of Crowded House)
        - Davey Spillane
        - Sharon Shannon
        - Elvis Costello
        - Maire Brennan
        - Andy Irvine
        - Paul Brady
        - Brian Kennedy
        - Liam O'Maonlai (from Hothouse Flowers)

     Kate has also designed some charity Christmas cards for the Brian Eno
     project "Warchild".

[Thanks Wieland for passing this on, and thanks Kate for a new song. Though
with 1 song/year we can expect the next full album in 2007 or so :-/]

     Hair Of The Hound (June 16, 1986):
        This tape is now out of date since all four videos from the Hounds of
        Love album are also on The Whole Story.  You might want to get the
        LaserDisc, since it's in CAV (Constant Angular Velocity) instead of
        CLV (Constant Linear Velocity) like The Whole Story, that means you
        have better freeze frame than with CLV LaserDiscs.
        Tracks: Running Up That Hill, Hounds Of Love, The Big Sky,
        Cloudbusting

[stuff about CAV and CLV added]

     The Sensual World (1989):
        Contains three videos from that album and interview footage with
        excerpts from a lot of other videos.  The American version (video tape
        as well as LaserDisc) contains much less interview footage than the
        British version.  The British version is the complete 1989 VH-1
        special.
        Tracks: Interview, The Sensual World, This Woman's Work, Love And
        Anger

[added the stuff about the LaserDisc]

     Songs about Kate Bush:

     Peter/Jimmy(?) Buffet - Mexico
        (?)
            This cover version of the old James Taylor song mentions Kate near
            the end of the song: "...gay men in blue jeans - no, no, that's not
            politically correct, that's KATE BUSH in blue jeans!!!" [E, DMcK]

[New entry, now is his name Peter or Jimmy? Elena said Peter, Daniel corrected
her to Jimmy, noone gave his/her comment about this]

4.6. Chart success

     Lionheart:
        US: 201 (in '84)
     The Dreaming:
        US: 157

[exact positions of these two albums in the Billboard charts by...]

     The biggets part of this list was compiled by studying old issues of
     Homeground.  Other entries came from [NB].

[...[NB], which is Norman Buchwald - thanks!]

  4.7. Printed books

4.8. Fanzines

     Kate Bush Club (KBC):

        The KBC also sends out short information sheets (just a photocopied
        DIN A4 page) more or less regularly.  To get these, send an SA[S]E
        marked with the current SAE number (currently SAE 12) to the KBC.
        Don't expect too much if there's not a new album or a convention
        around.

[#11 is out, see above, now we're waiting for #12]

4.9. Electronic books

     "Moments - A Red Shoes Collection"
        This is a collection done by Wieland Wilker [WW] which brings in all
        the stuff around The Red Shoes that came through love-hounds.
        You can find this collection on:

           <A  HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/moments/">ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/rec.music.gaffa/moments/</A>

[Thanks, Wieland, you seem to have too much time ;-)]

4.11.Kate Bush World Wide Web (WWW) pages

     Experiment IV, the Kate Bush Home Page:
        Thanks for Richard Frost &lt;r.frost@adl.dmt.csiro.au&gt; for setting
        this up, this is the definitive Kate Bush Web Page.  It's still
        under construction, but it is a one-stop center for all your
        Kate information needs.

[Richard has a new email address]

5.3. Lionheart

     Coffee Homeground
        This song features three lines in German, but it's not as prominent as
        in Hello Earth.  The lines read "Es schmeckt wunderbar" (it tastes
        wonderful), "Noch ein Glass mein Liebchen/Liebling" (another glass, my
        darling), and (maybe) "Dann sterb ich wohl" (then I will die).  The
        last of these is still not yet finally decided, since it's even
        difficult for native speakers of German to make out.  It might be
        something completely different, only Kate can tell...

[recent discussion about the third German line added - did we finally
come to a conclusion?]
