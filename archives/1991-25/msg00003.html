Recently, David Gavender, R.L.McMillion, and others have been discussing
various rock acts (for lack of a better term) such as The New Kids, GNR
KaTe, Happy, Innocence Mission, the Roches, and others.  The thread has
hit on discussions of the relative merits of each and what constitutes 
"Art" or an "artist", vs. a pop phenom, or a marketing ploy, or a product.
I'm not gonna get into that discussion, but it got me thinking.  

recently, on the infocd list, we were surveyed with one of the questions
being to provide our 10 DIDs, Desert Island Discs, which is basocally 
a take off of Pulse Magazine's DIDs column.  For those of you that aren't
familiar with this, the questions is simply, if you were stuck on a desser
Island, and were only allowed to have ten records/cassettes/cds, what 
would they be?

I'm curious as to the DIDS of the Love Hounds~p
So many of you seem to be virulent on your support of people like Peter
Gabriel, or Kate, or other types of "artists" as opposed to say Ratt, or
Whiteney Houston, or Duran Duran who seem to be just issuing records for 
the monetary rewards.  And yet, certainly none of us was into KaTe at
age 14 (I would guess).  I would suppose that any 30 year old such as 
myself, was into Ted Nugent, or Styx, or Flyod or Zep back in '77 or '78
when KaTe first burst on the scene.  Are any of these types of bands still
warm in anyone's heart?

I'm digressing, so let me tie this all together.  When I tried to sum up
my 10 favorite DIDS, I examined my whole collection, wrote down all of my
favorites, then paired the list to 10.  Man was this a tough thing to do!
I realized, however, that I didn't have six KaTe albums listed, or more
Beatles, or any Neil Young (THAT AMAZES ME).  I found that when push comes
to shove, I did want diversity.  So I'm curious.  Where do all of you stand?

Reading this digest, objectively, ie., having a non-Kate fanatic read it, 
I suppose we all sound a bit crazy with our constant "KaTe is God"
"She really is" comments.  Would your KaTe collection fill your musical
needs on a desert Island?  Not mine, my list is below and includes my 
observation to infocd...



          1. The Beach Boys       Friends/20/20 (or any BB on Capital)
          2. The Beatles          The Beatles
          3. Bow Wow Wow          I Want Candy
          4. Kate Bush            The Kick Inside
          5. The Doors            The Doors
          6. Don Henley           Building the Perfect Beast
          7. Paul McCartney       Ram
          8. Rainbow              Long Live Rock and Roll
          9. Squeeze              Singles 45 and Under
         10. Voice of the Beehive Let It Bee

     Comments:  Only 10 DID's?  I never realized how tough it was to
select only 10.  I'm amazed that Neil Young _Decade_, or Adam Ant
_Friend or Foe_, or Frankie Goes To Hollywood _Welcome to the Pleasuredome_
didn't make my list.  Wow!  And what about Brian Wilson, or the Bangles,
or, U2, or, or...





So, y'all, let's hear it.  What are you dids?

P.S.  i never joined the fray in the HoL vs TD constest of early spring,
mostly because you're ALL wrong.  To paraphrase myself of 12 years ago,

                TKI RULES !!!!!!

oh, yeah, Ritchie Blackmore is God!
