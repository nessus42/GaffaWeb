        I, too seem to have missed many posts.  Usually there are about 20-30
posts a day and the last week or so it seems that there have been, at most,
ten a day, plus I seem to read many responses that are to messages that I have
never read.  
        JORN, has THE GARDEN been posted into the archives yet??   Hopefully
Cloudbusting will arrive on Friday.  I have already posted the first Part of
it on GENIE.  
        On the question of Kate Bush VS. New Kids On The Block, where IED says
he suspects Kate fans are on "the correct path" and that NKOTB fans aren't, I
suspect the "correctness" of the path is less interesting than the LENGTH of
the path.  I don't know, but I seriously doubt most New Kids fans will have
any interest in them five or ten years from now.  As a matter of fact, I
suspect most of them will see it as an embarrasement.  This is the real
difference, for me.  'Cause I think most Kate fans, whether they stick with
Kate or not, won't end up feeling about her music that way.  As a matter a
fact, even if they end up leaving her music, they could very well see her as
part of the "path" that led them to other musics (ie. classical) wheras the
New Kids are a "dead end" path.  This is of course presuming that the New Kids
don't end up showing the kind of growth Kate and other people like the Beatles
did.
        This is just on the music side, on the personal side, I think New Kids
fans are in for a big let down.  It quite probable that in the next few
months/years, the image of the New Kids will dramaticlly change, as it usually
does for teen and other idols.  I don't know if it will happen simply cause
they aren't "Kids" any more or cause there image is to speaky clean to be real
anyways.  On the other hand, the image of "our" Kate remains rouphly the same
as it's always been.  Image has played a secondary role in our appreaciation
of Kate, certainly when compared to new kids, and Kate has always shunned
having much of any image, but I think she is just about the only person around
who portrays herself to be rouphy what she is.  Whatever the specifics of
Kate's life, I highly doubt that there is much that goes against the basic
image of a nice, dedicated artist.  I mean, just compare any "headlines" about
Kate compared to some of the recent "New Kids" headlines.  
 
        As far as favorite Kate videos - here's my list! 
 
THE BIG SKY - official version.  THE GREATEST VIDEO EVER!!!! 
THE WEDDING LIST - from Kate's TV special.  
THERE GOES A TENNOR - official version. 
SUSPENDED IN GAFFA - cause it's the only one I haven't seen!! 
 
        In case my earlier message didn't get through, I second Jorn's
recommendation of the Gurdjieff issue of Gnosis, interesting stuff! 
        Someone had asked about Kate schooling quotes, I don't know if they
made it the first time I posted them, but here they are in case they didn't.  
 
YOU GOT LOT OF "O" LEVELS, YOU GOT 10. [KATE LAUGHS] SEEMS LIKE A WORLD RECORD
TO ME.
        How did you know that? 
        OH, I KNOW A LOT OF THINGS.  [KATE LAUGHS] DID YOU ALWAYS WANT A
MUSICAL CAREER IN SPITE OF ALL THOSE QUALIFICATIONS? 
        Yes, I did.  I've always wanted to be involved in music.  I never
thought I'd actually be able to sing them, sing my songs.  But it seems that
I've done it.
        WELL, I DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE COULD DO THEM REALLY.  YOU LEFT SCHOOL
AT 16, WHAT DID YOU DO AS SOON AS YOU LEFT SCHOOL? 
        Well I started training as a dancer, because it seemed very
complimentary to the music, and I just didn't want to waste my days doing
nothing.  (1979, Ask Aspel)
 
        NOW YOU CAME AWAY FROM SCHOOL WITH TEN "O" LEVELS, SO DOES THAT MEAN
YOU WERE A VERY ATTENTATIVE PUPIL?
     I think I've just found the whole system of school something that didn't
really appeal to me - I couldn't really express myself in that whole system.
     SO, PRESUMABLY, YOU'RE FAVORITE LESSON WAS MUSIC?
     I did enjoy music and english, but, I just didn't really enjoy school as
I got older.
        WHY WAS THAT?
     It's very hard to say, um, I just...
     IT'S VERY RESTRICTIVE, WASN'T IT?
     Yes, I think I did find it restrictive.
     RIGHT, SO YOU COULDN'T GET AWAY QUICK ENOUGH?
     Well, at that point in my life, I really did want to leave school. 
(1985, Conversation Series 1)
 
        It was what I wanted to do.  I didn't want to go to University so I
didn't see any point in staying on.  (????,TWS)
 
    The idea of university just loomed like a really sinister thing. I
couldn't face it. I was lucky - something came up and took my mind off it. 
(1987, KBC 21)
 
        NEVERTHELESS, KATE QUIT SCHOOL AT THE AGE OF 16 WITH 10 "O" LEVELS,
SPECIALIZING IN ENGLISH AND MUSIC AND SHOWING AN UNUSUAL INTEREST IN LATIN,
ALTHOUGH SHE FOUND IT AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT LANGUAGE TO MASTER. 
        The reason I left was that I felt I could do something more in tune
with my purpose - music.   (1978, March, Melody Maker)
 
        I felt the only reason to stay in school was to take and get exams ...
after O levels, I felt I just didn't want to go on... (????,TWS)
 
        My parents weren't keen on the giving up of school at the beginning to
go into singing and dancing but once they saw I was serious about it they gave
support.
        I was quite stubborn about my decision and in the end they realized it
was for the best.   (C.1980, Music is my life)
 
    I definitely *became* a person when I left school and suddenly took
control of my life.  I felt like that was the first time I'd really been
there.  Do you. . .?  It was the beginning of my life really.  (1989, Q)
 
        The money [FROM AN INHERITANCE] did enable me to think that I could do
it because I was obviously worried about leaving school and finding myself
nowhere.  I had strong feelings in not having little securities like a nice
little job.  I wanted to try and do what I wanted and if it went wrong, okay,
but at least try to do it.  (1978, March, Melody Maker)
 
     YOU NEVER HAD ANY WORRIES ABOUT GETTING A JOB, DID YOU?
     Yes, I did. I think when you leave school and you don't know what you're
going to do, um, I was very much throwing myself to fate. if it hadn't worked,
I would have been in a very difficult situation. and, I just worked very hard
and hoped that I'd be able to make something of it and I was very lucky.
     DID YOU EVER CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE CAREER?
     I considered it, but it was never anything serious. and that's why I felt
I had to leave school and just go for it, cos if I didn't make an attempt to
throw myself into that lifestyle, I didn't feel it was something that was
going to come to me.   It's something you have to go out and get.
     WAS THAT PARTLY INFLUENCED BY YOUR UPBRINGING, BY YOUR PARENTS?
     I don't know what it was influenced by. I think it was the very strong
desire in me that had started when I first started writing at the piano that
this was what I wanted to do. I didn't want to go to university.  I didn't
want to be in a job where I couldn't be creative.
        BUT HOW DID OTHER PEOPLE REACT TO THAT? THEY MUST HAVE BEEN A BIT
TAKEN A BACK.
        You mean my family?
     YEAH, YOUR FAMILY, IN PARTICULAR.
     Yes, I think obviously, my parents were very concerned. I was leaving
school going into something that was completely insecure and I think really
they had a tremendous amount of faith in me, in that they wanted me to be
happy. and they understood that I wasn't just spending my time doing nothing.
I was very seriously working on a career that could be insecure, but they had
a great deal of faith in me.  (1985, Conversation Series 1)
 
        DID YOU EVER CONSIDER DOING SOMETHING ELSE, OTHER THAN BEING A SINGER?

        When I was at school I wanted to be a vet and a physiatrist, but I
didn't really, I didn't really want to be that was just, I suppose, to keep
people happy to think that if I did get a career it would be a straight one. 
But it wasn't what I wanted to do at all. 
        DID YOU DO THINKS LIKE A LEVELS AND O LEVELS? 
        I took O levels and my mock A's but I left before...
        HOW MANY O'S DID YOU GET?
        [LAUGHS] I got ten. 
        TEN! 
        Yeah.  
        THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU WENT OFF TO SING? 
        I don't think so no.  I think they thought I was a bit foolish.  But,
um, I though it was right.  
        WAS THERE ONE DAY WHEN YOU DECIDED, "THAT'S IT!  I'M GOING TO BE A
SINGER, I'M GOING TO MAKE THAT A CAREER?
        Yes there was!   I didn't think there would have been, but one day I
was with a friend in a park, and I just knew that was what I wanted to do.  I
had to leave school and I had to do it.  And I'm very glad I did!   (1979,
Kate Bush On Tour)
 
        I think that actual decision about going for it was just before I left
school and that's why I left school.  I didn't feel that I could get what I
wanted out of school anymore in a way that was going to encourage me getting
involved with music.  I really had to leave and go into a more artistic kind
of lifestyle and dancing was a particulary good one to choose I think. 
        Well, when I left school I knew very much that I wanted to go into the
music business, that that's what I wanted to aim for.  And I wanted to do
something that would fill my day, that would be a good discipline for me, and
that would be complimentary to the music.  And dance was something that I'd
only just discovered recently at that time.  And I felt that there was a whole
world of expression there that I'd never experienced and that perhaps the
combination of that with singing would make an interesting performing vehicle.
 So I started training with a mine artist called Lindsay Kemp, who was a very
big inspiration for me, and then started dancing at a school.  And since then,
though the videos the dance has been an incredibly useful thing for me. 
(1985, Good Rockin Tonight)
