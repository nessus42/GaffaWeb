Man alive, I am _OVERJOYED_ at the reaction to my asking for everyone's
DIDs.  I really believed that most of you would list the box set as 
eight of the ten, just so you could demonstrate your commitment to the 
"cause".  I was wrong!

Part of my motivation was that I have been introduced to several artists
via the lovehounds and I was curious in general who else might get mentioned.
Already I have taken notes on some recomendations-Act/Propganda, Coctou Twins,
to name just two-on stuff that sounds intriging.  Keep them DID lists coming!

I've given some thought to assembling these lists into a dids file.  Would 
there be any interest if I did?  When I finish, I could put it in the 
archives if there was some interest.  Given my 2 second MTV attention 
span, however, I make no promises.

Finally, to our moderator, how many lovehounds are there? I would assume
that it would be easy to count the digest people, is there any way to 
count those on rec.mus.gaffa?

P.S. the the Happy fans out there.  WXPR "listener supported public radio
from the University of Penn" played a track from Warpaint on 22 July at
noon.  The DJ commented offhandedly that *HE* would not recommend the CD-
leading me to believe that the program director wanted it played.  Since
I'm not involved with the Happy list, I posted this here, for what its
worth.

P.P.S.  Why is it musically correct to like/respect New Edition (and its 
spinoffs Bell Biv Devoe, Bobby Brown, etc) when it is musically incorrect
to like/respect the New kids?  the same Svengali created them both for 
the sole purpose of generating $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.
