&gt;Really-From: "Michael H. Dyre" &lt;MHDYRE01%ULKYVM.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu&gt;

&gt;In going thru some old albums, I noticed that John Giblin (Love and Anger,
&gt;Rocket's Tail) played bass on Phil Collins' 1981 _In the Air tonight_ along
&gt;with Shankar on Violin recently with Peter Gabriel on _Passion_.

Giblin also played on Collins' HELLO, I MUST BE GOING in addition to FACE VALUE.

More trivia:  John Giblin's claim to fame, at least for me personally, was as
one of the bass players for Brand X.  He came on the scene late in the Brand X
game, round about the release of PRODUCT in 1979, I think.  He was also playing
on DO THEY HURT? and IS THERE ANYONE ABOUT?  He joined Percy Jones on the bass
for some tracks, and by his lonesome on others.

Brand X was a progressive rock/sort-of-fusion band, that also featured Morris
Pert, Robin Lumley, John Goodsall, Peter Robinson, Mike Clarke, and Phil
Collins.  And, liner notes by Michael Palin.

Unorthodox Behavior  (1976)
Moroccan Roll  (1977)
Livestock  (1978, live album)
Masques  (1978)
Product  (1979)
Do They Hurt?  (1980)
Is There Anything About?  (1982)

and a compilation last year, I think.

There is one more album, not listed under Brand X, called MARSCAPE (1978?)
The front cover credits Jack Lancaster (a saxplayer not in Brand X) and
Robin Lumley (Brand X's keyboardist), however the rest of the group is
included, as well as an orchestra.
