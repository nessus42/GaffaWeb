_Cash Box_ has finally reviewed the album, in the Dec. 16 issue:

KATE BUSH:  _The Sensual World_ (Columbia OCT 44164)

     Kate Bush's influence can be heard in so many new acts that she
should be receiving royalties.  Ethereal vocals, literate, provocative
lyrics and an unforced sexiness that almost always catches the listener
slightly off guard, so powerful and potent is that element of her work.
All those characteristics are in full force on _World_, Bush's first
release in three years and a timely reminder of one of the biggest
talents, male or female, of this decade.  Whereas she was once awfully
pretentious (appealing, interesting and full of promise, but pretentious
nonetheless), her talents have ripened so that the gap between what she
hears in her head and what we, the audience, finally hear are, if not in
perfect sync, then at least on the same wavelength.  No longer do you say,
"Well, I know the effect she's *after*."  The emotional and social
terrains covered on this album are among the richest and most ambitious
of this year, and are wholly satisfying.  The track "This Woman's Work,"
originally featured on the soundtrack to _She's Having a Baby_ and now 
available as a single on import, should turn up on several critic's 
lists as one of the best of the year, if not the decade.  The same could
be said of the album.
				--  Ernest Hardy

Interestingly, in this magazine the album continues to climb in the
charts.  It is up from 33 to 32 this week.
