Howdy,

 I am so ecstatic.  I just got the new Ryuichi Sakamoto album, 
 Beauty, from a Japanese Pen Pal.  I can tell that it will take
 a few listenings before I really know which of these songs I'll
 love.  It is so different from his previous albums.  The 
 vocalizations come from so many countries.  The combination
 of classic Japanese, synthesized sounds, other styles of music
 from around the world challanges my prejudices, both artistic
 and otherwise.  The more I listen, the more I like it.

   OH, YES.  I'm sorry this is a Kate Bush newsgroup.
   Not that any of those comments above could relate
   to her at all. 8^)

   Oh, YES.  What prompted me to make my first posting to this
   newsgroup after reading it for a couple of years and having
   met many of the network personalities and personae at Tracy's
   Place, pre-earthquake:

	I went to a Bay Area Swap Meet last weekend.  I was 
	able to obtain a number of video renderings of Kate, 
	which for me produce such a satisfying artistic 
	expression.  Kate is able through dance/mime explain 
	many aspects of her lyrics which I seldom understand
	just from listening.

	I was surprised and quite disappointed to find that 
	none of the Beatle bootlegs were available.  I asked 
	around and no one knew anyone who had them.  In fact 
	there were no bootleg cd's anywhere.  Finally someone 
	told me that there had been a raid at the previous
	swap meet and those things were gone.  Someone else 
	commented to me that bootlegs were too popular and 
	would be around much longer than any arguments to 
	their moral validity would be.

	Well, most of that disappointment faded due to what
	I did find.  I wasn't looking for it, since I have
	either missed any information about it in this news
	group, or no one else has posted of its existence.
	I found a book of piano arrangements of Kates songs.
	Well, not all, but according to the 1981 cover, 
	"The Best of Kate Bush".  I can't say that these are the
	best of all possible arrangements, but most of them
	seem reasonable from the few quick play throughs
	I've done.


	The list of songs:

	Army Dreamers
	Babooshka
	Breathing
	December Will be Magic Again
	Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake
	Hammer Horror
	James And The Cold Gun
	The Man With The Child In His Eyes
	Oh England My Lionheart
	Saxophone SOng
	Them Heavy People
	Wow
	Wuthering Heights

	This would lead me to believe, that there are 
	other relatively good arrangement/transcriptions 
	of Kate's music.

	The credits:

Editor: Cecil Bolton	Text: Peggy Jones	Design: Dan Galvin
Butterfly Artwork: Nick Price	Photographs: Novercia
	Piano Transcriptions: Gordon Rees.
	Kate's Comments (C) Novercia Ltd. 1980


	Does anyone know of any other collections?  I would suspect
	they are from the U.K.
						Steve
