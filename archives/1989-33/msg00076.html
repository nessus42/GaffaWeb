I DO NOT list the number of times I hear Kate on the radio -- at
least I haven't for many months.  I did at the beginning, when it was so
rare.  But now, I hear Kate at least once a day, and several times
on many days.  It would be ridiculous for me to post that every day.
When the album is actually featured on a particular day (which will
not happen any more) I like to put what was played in the record.

However, I think it might be informative to see how high she is on
their playlist, as an example of how Kate is doing on alternative
radio generally.  I for one am interested in other reports around
the country.

Also, I sometimes quote the DJ's when they talk about Kate.  I love
to hear people talk about her (in a positive way, of course), so
I assume other people do too.

I've been posting a lot of reviews and things lately, too.  I've gotten
lots of encouragement from people to keep this up, so I will certainly
continue.  When I don't post a review, but simply mention its existence,
|&gt;oug always asks me to send him a copy for his archives.  If I have to
type it in for him, I may as well send it to all of Love-Hounds, since
I'm sure some people are interested.

The main thing I want to say, though, is that for heaven's sake, if
you're not interested in an article, JUST SKIP TO THE NEXT ONE!  I
will not be hurt.
