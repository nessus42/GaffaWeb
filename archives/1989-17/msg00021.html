(referring to article &lt;8908281244.AA12377@EDDIE.MIT.EDU&gt;)

[stuff deleted]
&gt;  So..._Temptation_ is pretty hard to find.  As far as the soundtrack goes,
&gt;there really is no reason that censors should ban it...(in my opinion at
&gt;least)...while it may be the soundtrack to a controversial MOVIE, the
&gt;soundtrack itself is just instrumental (no blasphemous lyrics).  And as
&gt;for the author of _The Last Temptation of Christ_, his name escapes me too.
&gt;All I can remember is that it's something Greek-sounding, like Nikos Theo-
&gt;something-or-other.  (BIG help, right??  :) )

The author of `The Last Temptation' is/was Nikos Kazantzakis , who
happens to be one of my favourite authors. His most famous noven is
undoubtedly `Zorba The Greek'. Other famous novels of his are `Christ
Recrucified' (no, it's not a sequel to `The Last Temptation'!!) and
his autobiography. Anyone who has read the preface to `The Last
Temptation' will know that Kazantzakis wasn't trying to be
blasphemous. We was just - shall-we-say - non-standard Christian. (The
book was banned by the Vatican, like many other famous works!)

&gt;  Anyway, sorry if I misled you about _Temptation_.  I'm just sorry that
&gt;you didn't (and won't) get a chance to see it.  Have any friends in
&gt;America that you can visit??  :)

Might be the only option... the film was `banned' in Inverness, as far
as I remember.  Another film on a similar topic, `Life of Brian'
(starring John Cleese), cannot be shown on BBC TV. The same goes for
`The Exorcist` and `Last Tango in Paris'. Some people in the UK are
worried by the fact that satellite TV might result in `high-quality
televised pornography' [sic] from France. The BBC and ITV (the two
commercial channels) have censors who spend their time previewing
everything, removing sex &amp; nude scenes (and even sometimes a little
violence...(from Miami Vice)). A certain elderly lady OAP by the name
of Mary Whitehouse spends her time complaining of any televised
activity that might suggest that people use the parts of their bodies
located between the neck and the knees.

Now for the music-related part of the posting. Unfortunately it has
got nothing to do with KaTe, but...

A friend of mine recently heard a song on the radio by a group called
`Mannheim Steamroller' (or something like that). He has looked in all
the (major) record stores in town, but still hasn't got a clue as to
where the group comes from or they have released any albums. 

Can anyone enlighten him/me ? (I bet it's some kind of American 70s
symphonic rock, since that's what he normally goes for (sigh))

Regards
