 Subject: Rumors condemned to Tower of London on Friday the 13th

     Anthony Meadley asks whether there is any truth to the story
that some of John Carder Bush's poetry has been consigned to the
Tower of London for its obscenity. No. The truth is that two of
John Carder Bush's poems, published ca. 1970-74, are housed in
the Special Collections Room at the British Library. This is
a collection more often referred to as the "Enfer" (Hell), because
it was used to keep so-called obscene (mainly pornographic) books
in a separate place from the main collection.
     The poems, however, are not what anyone (except perhaps our
more righteous and "sin"-obsessed minority) would call pornographic.
The fact is that there are a great many books that are in the BL's
SC which "make the grade" by a very slim margin, so to speak. It's
really no big deal.
     (IED says "a couple of poems", because JCB has published a few of
his two- or three-page poems individually, as books.)
     As for the report about _The_Sensual_World_ being scheduled for
Friday the 13th, that would be neat, except that _The_Sensual_World_ is
scheduled for October 16th. Sorry, CJ.
