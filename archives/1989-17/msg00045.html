     The single, _The_Sensual_World_: UK release date September 18.
IED's information is not certain on this next point, but it seems that
it's just _possible_ that the title of the _album_ (though not the
single) may really be _The_Sensual_World_in_October_. This still seems
very hard to believe, and as IED says, his information is vague in this
particular, but for the record, it is possible.
     Kate "really likes" the new album, is very pleased with it, and
--this may be of some comfort to the more hardcore fans--she says that
she's "not at all sure it will be popular in America," but that she did
not let herself worry about that in making this album.
     Furthermore, she believes that there will be a _different_ first
single choice for the CBS (U.S.) release than the one chosen for the
rest of the world (_The_Sensual_World_). IED gathers that Kate still
has little say in what happens to her product in the U.S., or else that
she is willing to bow to the advice of the U.S. companies on such points.
Basically, IED understands that although she would of course be happy
to find that the new album is successful in the U.S., she is _not_
particularly interested one way or the other.
     Also, Kate has, as of September 1, only shot _one_ video, the
one which is to accompany the single _The_Sensual_World_. Ergo, since
the chances are that CBS will release a different song as the first
single in the U.S., there is still no video to accompany that other
song. Kate did not seem to be in any great hurry to get such a second
video done for the U.S. market, either.
     As for touring--she has no plans to do a tour at this time, but
she has not ruled out the possibility of planning a tour in a year or
so, if the album should prove successful in the U.S. Any plans for a
tour at this point would be contingent upon the album already showing
signs of huge popularity, because CBS would otherwise not be likely to
want to pay for the kind of production she would require. At any rate,
she has not yet closed her mind to the idea of touring sometime within
the next year or eighteen months.
     Finally, the record company has been slating her for a lot of
interviews, possibly including _Rolling_Stone_.
     That is all that IED knows at this time. And if you're wondering
how he came to learn all this--don't ask.
