Some semi-tongue-in-cheek predictions about some future events in Kate's live:

1. The first single from "The Sensual World", to be released in late September,
will be in the vein of so-called "Acid House" music. It will be panned by the
the music press in Britian, where "Acid House" is now associated with
perversion, drug taking, pidgeon killing and other immorality. 

Kate will defend the song saying "That's not really what it's about, but
it's kind of you to think so!".

2. Plans for a world-wide, two year tour will be announced and then quickly
postponed indefinitely. It will later be mentioned in the press that Kate 
has been seen "in a motherly way" at recent public appearances.

Kate will respond to this saying, "That's not really what it's about, but
it's kind of you to think so!".

3. Sting, Midge Ure and Bob Geldof (spelling?) will change the emphasis of a
benefit at Wembley stadium from "Save the Rain Forest!" to "Save the East 
Wickham Farm!" after it is learned that the Bush family plan on selling the 300
year-old estate to a Canadian shopping mall developer for 4.3 million pounds.
Speculation will run rampant that Kate needs the money to pursue a criminal
investigation against a world-wide gang of bootleggers who got ahold of some
early demo tapes.

Kate will deny this need saying, "That's not really what it's about, but
it's kind of you to think so!".

Here's to the new album, "Huzza, huzza, huzza!"
