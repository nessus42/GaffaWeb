 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick
 Subject: _The_Sensual_World_ release dates

     Steve Schonberger has suggested that IED share again what knowledge
he has so far acquired on the subject of release dates for _The_Sensual_
World_. According to IED's latest information, the 7" and 12" (and
perhaps a CD-single, either in 3" or 5" form?) of _The_Sensual_World_--
the title of the first single as well as the album--will be released
sometime around the end of September, in _England_ and Europe.
     Then the _album_ will be released on Monday, October 16, again
in _England_ and (presumably) the rest of Europe. The official release
date of the album in the United States is still October 17th, according
to some PR person in the Hollywood offices whom IED pestered again this
afternoon. However, she did not have a date for a U.S. release of any
single from the album yet, nor did she even know whether _The_Sensual_
_World_ would be used as the first single in this territory or not.
      Meanwhile _Billboard_ has finally noted the imminent arrival of
Kate's new album. In the brief column called "UK Beat" (in the latest
issue) the album's release is noted, as is the information that it was
produced by Kate Bush and Del Palmer together, and that Dave Gilmour
is featured on it. Also, even this simple bit of information was badly
screwed up by either the writer of the column or the typesetter, for
it reads as follows: "...Word finally comes of the release of Kate
Bush's album _The_Sensual_World_In_October_..."
     That is all IED knows about the dates so far. He assumes that
it will be possible to find advance copies of the first single in L.A.
sometime around September 15-25, and if this proves correct Love-Hounds
may rest assured that they will hear about it in this forum.
     IED must, however, warn all readers of Love-Hounds (to some this
will no doubt come as welcome news) that he will probably not have much
to say to the group for a while following his acquisition of the new
single and album, as he will proabably feel that a suitable period of
silent, private contemplation should be observed by him. He looks
forward to much stimulating discussion about the new music as soon as
that period shall have passed.
