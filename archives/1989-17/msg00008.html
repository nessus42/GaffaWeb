Hello there Andrew--
  I saw your note in Love-Hounds regarding the banning of Martin Scorsese's
_The Last Temptation of Christ_.  Sorry.  I guess that, by giving a review
of the movie, I led you to believe that _Temptation_ was easy to find
around here.  It isn't.  I live near Albany, New York (the state capitol)
and I believe there was only ONE theatre around here that didn't ban the
film...and THAT theatre took more than it's share of abuse from people
picketing and so on.  Once the movie left the theatre, the same people who
opposed the film were trying to ban _Temptation_ from hitting the video
rental places, and for the most part they were successful.  There are only
a few places that carry the movie...that's why I was so surprised to find
the movie in, of all places, a local supermarket which has a video rental!
  So..._Temptation_ is pretty hard to find.  As far as the soundtrack goes,
there really is no reason that censors should ban it...(in my opinion at
least)...while it may be the soundtrack to a controversial MOVIE, the
soundtrack itself is just instrumental (no blasphemous lyrics).  And as
for the author of _The Last Temptation of Christ_, his name escapes me too.
All I can remember is that it's something Greek-sounding, like Nikos Theo-
something-or-other.  (BIG help, right??  :) )
  Anyway, sorry if I misled you about _Temptation_.  I'm just sorry that
you didn't (and won't) get a chance to see it.  Have any friends in
America that you can visit??  :)
  Take care.
                                       All the best,
                                            Deb Wentorf
