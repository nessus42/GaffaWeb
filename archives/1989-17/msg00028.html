Mannheim Steamroller is the cornerstone of a smallish independent record
label over here in the US called American Gramaphone.  The label got its
start in the mid-to-late '70s with a series of audiophile-quality LP
releases that were sold mainly through record stores as demo disks; the
single most successful of these albums was one called "Fresh Aire" by
a band called Mannheim Steamroller.

Released in 1975, "Fresh Aire" blended classical forms with a mix of
contemporary and traditional instrumentation (read:  piano,
harpsichords, horns, and strings meet synths and drumkits) to produce
an early precursor to much of the New Age music of today.  Composer
Chip Davis is the core of MS, writing all the material.  And yes, he is
the guy behind C.W. McCall of "Convoy" fame.

Over the years American Gramaphone has diversified its catalog somewhat,
but Mannheim Steamroller (and more recently, the band's attendant
paraphenelia) are still the centerpiece of the label.  Each of Mannheim
Steamroller's albums is linked to a theme, making them instrumental
concept albums in a way.  Here's what they have out:

	FRESH AIRE
		Topic: Spring
	FRESH AIRE II
		Topic: Fall
	FRESH AIRE III
		Topic: Summer.  Their strongest album, in my opinion,
		with a very baroque sound in places.
	FRESH AIRE IV
		Topic: Winter
	FRESH AIRE INTERLUDES
		A re-recorded collection of softer pieces from the early
		albums, with an environmental twist.  Quite soothing and
		pleasant.
	FRESH AIRE V
		A fascinating album, taking on the theme of Johannes
		Kepler's early writings on possible travel to the
		moon.
	FRESH AIRE VI
		Based on themes of greek mythology.
	THE MANNHEIM STEAMROLLER CHRISTMAS
		The single best album of Christmas music, ever.
	"A FRESH AIRE CHRISTMAS"
		A close second.
	SAVING THE WILDLIFE
		Soundtrack to a public-television special.
	CLASSICAL GAS
		With Mason Williams

If you can't get these CDs in Scotland (not an unlikely prospect) then you
may have to write to the label:

	Mail Order Department
	American Gramaphone Records
	9130 Mormon Bridge Road
	Omaha, Nebraska 68152

This stuff is definitely NOT bombastic '70s symphonic rock, but if you
haven't heard it yourself, it's hard to understand exactly what it *is*.
Not to everyone's tastes, but worth a listen.  For the new listener, I'd
strongly recommend Fresh Aire III first, followed probably by the first
Christmas album and then Fresh Aire V.  A word of warning, though: these
are short albums, virtually all in the under-forty-minute range.

                                                Lazlo (csbrkaac@ariel.unm.edu)
