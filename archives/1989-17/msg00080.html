&gt;Really-From: tracyr@uunet.uu.net (jane smallberries)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;welcome back to ed!  glad to see you're back where you clearly 
&gt;belong (posting to love-hounds).  i too, heard the top 105
&gt;"modern rock" songs on live 105, and was pleased to hear 3
&gt;songs in a row from KT (first experience of hearing *any* KT
&gt;on the radio, for me).  i think all three were taken from
&gt;_the whole story_, as the version of "wuthering heights" they
&gt;played was that one with the different vocals (an older kate
&gt;voice, where she really pronounces "Heath-Cliff").  
&gt;

It sure is glad to be back from New Mexico, where the choice of 
radio stations is limited, to be sure.

Yes, the version of W.H. they played is the one from _The Whole Story_.
In fact, that's the version they *always* play (and I've heard them play
that song about nine times now).  I've only heard them play a Kate song
not from _The Whole Story_ once:  "The Big Sky".  The DJ who played that
was Steve Masters, who's also the music director, so he's allowed to play
anything he likes.  The other KT songs KITS ("Live-105") has played, to
my knowledge, are RUTH (about five times), "Hounds of Love" (about four
times), "Experiment IV" (about six times), and "Cloudbusting" (once).
I think TWS is the only album the station has; Mr. Masters occasionally 
brings in his own albums.

I started listening to this station last December, so you can get an idea
of how frequently they play Kate.

Also, if you can pick up KFJC at 89.7 FM from Los Altos Hills, Tracy, then you
should listen to "Holden Caulfield"'s show Mondays from 6 am to 10 am.
He's a very big Kate fan, and plays something from her most weeks.  On
his show, I've heard "The Dreaming", "There Goes a Tenner", "Burning
Bridge", "The Big Sky" (Meteorological Mix), "Ran Tan Waltz", "Babooshka",
"Suspended in Gaffa", "Leave It Open", and "All We Ever Look For", among 
others.  If someone requests Kate, he'll almost certainly play her.

Incidentally, KITS was just voted radio station of the year by _Billboard_
magazine, and Steve Masters was named Music Director of the year. (This is
in the category of major market album/modern/oldies rock station.)
