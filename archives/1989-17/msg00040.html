* From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
* Subject: More of the same
*
[the usual loquacious bulk of IED's post has been abbreviated]
*     IED wondered for a time at the ease with which people like Tim
*Maroney and Lazlo could resolve these undeniably complex issues, and
*make their violent, righteous attacks against others with such blithe
*equanimity. They may be able to claim a moral superiority over :&gt;oug's
*position, which IED also finds untenable. But even there--and
*certainly in any comparison of their moral deliberations with IED's--
*they seem excessively smug and self-confident. IED asked himself why?
*     And an explanation occurred to him. Tim and Lazlo seem to find
*it quite easy to reject all of the mitigating circumstances and
*arguments which IED considered, and to place all their confidence in
*the simple assumption that Kate's moral right over her tapes precedes,
*overrules and condemns all other aspects of this particular case.
*     And why is this? Their simple-minded concern with only
*one piece in a complex, many-sided puzzle does not indicate that
*Tim and Lazlo are better able to judge the problem than the rest
*of us. On the contrary. So what other distinctions between them
*and us can be seen? In IED's opinion, there can be only one explanation:
*Lazlo and Tim Maroney are not, according to IED's definition of the
*term above, "true" Kate Bush fans. [...]
*[...] Rather, their sacrifice is to be pitied, for the only
*thing that it indicates to IED is that they do not truly live in the
*world of Kate's art. This is a fact. [...]
*[... on what they claim are purely moral
*grounds is really nothing more than an unwitting admission that their
*appreciation of Kate's art is insufficient to override their rather
*ordinary and facile sense of right and wrong. And for this, IED
*pities them both.
*
*-- Andrew Marvick

Not True KaTe Fans ????
Not True KaTe Fans !!!!
Come on, IED, admit it, we all know that Tim Maroney and Lazlo (sounds
like a great name for a bar band, doesn't it: "Tim Maroney and Lazlo")
are just arguing because they like too.  They don't care about KaTe's
demos, and what to do with the bootleggers who are profiting from sales
of poorly made records.  They don't really care what we Gaffan's do,
either, as long as we respond to their posts and continue to acknowledge
them...
