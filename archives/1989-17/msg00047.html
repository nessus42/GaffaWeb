In article &lt;8908281244.AA12377@EDDIE.MIT.EDU&gt; Deb writerered:
&gt;_The Last Temptation of Christ_.  Sorry.  I guess that, by giving a review
&gt;of the movie, I led you to believe that _Temptation_ was easy to find
&gt;around here.  It isn't.  I live near Albany, New York (the state capitol)
&gt;and I believe there was only ONE theatre around here that didn't ban the
&gt;film...and THAT theatre took more than it's share of abuse from people
&gt;picketing and so on.  Once the movie left the theatre, the same people who
&gt;opposed the film were trying to ban _Temptation_ from hitting the video
&gt;rental places, and for the most part they were successful.  There are only
&gt;a few places that carry the movie...that's why I was so surprised to find
&gt;the movie in, of all places, a local supermarket which has a video rental!

I don't want to start up more legal arguments.  It seems that Usenet is full
of aspiring lawyers, who write "I'm not a lawyer, but &lt;200 lines&gt;".

I wonder how far one a protester can go under the law.  The Oz and US law
systems are based on UK or European ideas, and so general principals
probably port across fairly accurately.

A basic tennant seems to be that one has the right to `injure' someone's
beliefs, but not their physical person.   So that  &lt;Salmon Rushdie&gt;  can
write a book which is (allegedly) offensive to the beliefs of &lt;Muslims&gt;,
and they cannot &lt;kill&gt; him becuase of it.
This seems to be at odds with &lt;Islamic {Fundamentalist} Law&gt; though....


Take the case of someone protesting outside a movie.  If they physically
{but non-violently} block the door, then to get in, you have to move them,
and therefore, probably in a legalesque sense, "Assault" them.

This looks kinda crazy, I know, but I have absolutly no idea what the law
says about this sort of pacifistic "unstoppable force and immovable object"
situation.   It looks to me like, given a sympathetic police force,
whichever side uses less physical contact/force is more in the right.
So that if the [extremist] protesters form a human mountain blocking the
entrances, then they can validly stop [non-extremists] people getting in.
(Unless they all go in through the unguarded exits!  ;-)

Any comments?   Can extremism win through pacifism?

BTW. How did Rushdie's "Satanic Verses" book go in other places of the world?
Here there were marches and protests and some [illegal] calls for Rushie to
be assassinated.   Some bomb threats were made to book stores intending to
stock it, but I don't remember any bombs being found/detonated.
I think many book stores backed down, and refused to stock it.
