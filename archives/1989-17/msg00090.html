&gt;On Sept 26, the new Tears for Fears album is due to be released.  The first
&gt;single is already on the radio in some places (I heard it in, of all places,
&gt;Indianapolis, but have yet to hear it here in Pittsburgh).

Yes, it's called "Sowing the Seeds of Love", and it's already available
domestically as a cassette single and a CD5" single (with about an extra
minute at the end of the CD5 version).  Also included are a short, throwaway
song called "Tears Roll Down" (which would have made a great song if they'd
finished it), and the CD5 also has the "U.S. Remix" of "Shout" (pretty lame).

&gt;It's a fun song, neat melodicly, and not quite as depressing as some of TFF's
&gt;earlier stuff.  

I agree - it's very optimistic.  Jonathan - you're the first person I've
seen that mentioned the single without mentioning how much it sounds like
"I Am The Walrus".  It's supposedly an open tribute to the Beatles.  The
video is also very good, IMHO.

&gt;I didn't catch the name of the new album, nor any rumors re: why it took so
&gt;long to come out with it (about 4 years by my count).  Anyone else heard?

The new album is supposedly called _The Seeds of Love_.  Pick up a copy of
the most recent _Q_ magazine to see an interesting recounting of the events
of the last 4 years.  In a nutshell, they began work with two producers
(sorry, I forget who), then started over with Chris Hughes producing (he
also produced _Songs from the Big Chair_).  After finishing about an album's
worth of stuff, Roland and Chris got into what Curt calls "an Olympic
shouting match" over a guitar sound, so they sacked Chris and started over,
producing themselves with David Bascombe (_Big Chair_ engineer) co-producing.

Does anyone know of bootleg releases of the finished-but-never-to-be-released
tracks?
