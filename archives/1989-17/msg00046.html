Let's talk about ... Kate.  After listening to both obsKuriTies I
&amp; II (thanks Tracy!), I'd like to make a few observations.  First
off, it's just so amazing that she had done so much at such a
young age.  Being a frustrated musician in my youth only increases
my awe for what she accomplished.  One would expect most of her
work to be like "Camilla" which has a neat little melody and
interesting lyrics but lacks something overall (IMHO).  Being the
work of a child, one can definitely recognize talent in the song
and would expect improvement through continued work.  Other songs
though lack nothing.  I love "Maybe (aka Davy)" and "Passing
through Air".  I can't help but wonder if the version of "Maybe"
recorded later for "The Kick Inside" will ever released?  We can
only hope.  Finally, "December Will Be Magic Again" is currently
my favorite song which means I play it time and again.  I just
hope the tape doesn't wear out before Christmas.

Now for another problem, I'm becoming dangerously musically
uni-dimensional.  With Katemas and these two new KT tapes, I find
myself listening to Kate Bush to the exclusion of other artists. 
With another album due for release soon, the problem can only get
worse.  I've been writing a lot lately, and while writing I'll
listen to obsKuriTies I and then obsKuriTies II.  Then I'll
put on TKI to listen for similarities, and then HoL just because I
like it.  Well we've gone this far, maybe we can put on "The
Dreaming" to liven things up.  Then we dig out "Lionheart" and
then "Never Forever", and then maybe more obsKuriTies to reflect
on the beginnings of such a precocious and perceptive talent. 
Corey believes that this can be easily controlled by listening to
other music, if Corey can only remember what that is.  Corey
believes there is no danger of turning into ... AAAARRGGHH!
It's already happening, Corey is writing in the third person!
