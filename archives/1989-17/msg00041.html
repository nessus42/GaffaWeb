	I have noticed that most of the people I know in the:

		SCA/Renn Faire/Computers/Technical/Folkie... etc.

	genre seem to like both Kate Bush and Jethro Tull.  I would like
	to know why people out there think this is...

Most of the people I know in the computer/technical "genre" have never
even heard of Kate Bush, and if they have, they know her as "the one
who did that stuff for Peter Gabriel" (i.e. backing vocals).  I myself
(I admit it) was a member of the latter group until about a year and a
half ago when I bought The Whole Story (mostly because I liked the
poster so much :-). (Needless to say my life changed forever that day.)
Of the people I know who *have* heard "real" KT music, most of them are
either ambivalent about it, or downright hate it.  One guy even told me
he once won a Kate Bush record from a local radio station, listened to
it once, and then (gasp!) "used it as a frisbee."  Personally, I
wouldn't do this with any disk (even if I loathed it), but to do it
with a KT disk is surely a felony.  The unfortunate point is that,
unlike you, I know *VERY* few people (in any discipline) who know of
and like Kate Bush.  KT is a lonely habit around here (TGFLH*!).

On a sweeter note, I attended a record collectors convention in town
this past weekend, and they had *tons* of Kate stuff.  I picked up
the Big Sky Meteorological Mix 12" and a couple of new posters.  It was
indeed most comforting to see so much Kate stuff and so many people
(mostly the collectors) who knew who she was!  Wow!
