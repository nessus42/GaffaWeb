&gt; Really-From: nv89-pyl@nada.kth.se (Patrik Yle'n)
 
&gt; I feel I must agree with you on this point, I've had the album
&gt; for a week now, and I've been listening to it almost constantly.
&gt; I don't think that TSW comes anywhere near to The Dreaming or
&gt; HOL when it comes to conveying the feeling in the songs...
&gt; There are no songs on TSW that give me goosebumps like
&gt; "Cloudbusting" or "Night of The Swallow" for instance.
 
Really? I shiver ever time I listen to the album. Even after I had
owned the promocassette for a month and had worn the tape out, I
shivered when I bought the CD one day late and played it at loud
volumes in a dark room. "The Fog", "Never Be Mine", "Rocket's 
Tail" and "Deeper Understanding" all scare the skin right off of
my body, they're so eerie and powerful...

&gt; Of course, there are some great songs TSW as well, "Heads We're
&gt; Dancing" and "Never be Mine" for instance, but I think TSW isn't
&gt; nowhere near the class of TD or HOL.

Will people stop comparing TSW to HoL or TD!?!?!?!? It's a completely
different album and should not be "measured" against other works,
either KT's or other artists. Look at it for what it is and if then
it doesn't do anything for you, you can flame it, but don't say
that isn't worth it just because it isn't on the level of earlier
works.

Sorry for picking on you directly Patrik, you have not been the
only offender; however, you said what others are saying most suc-
cintly and I could not contain myself.
