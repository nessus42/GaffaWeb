	I've listened to it at least twice a day since I bought it.  Sometimes
closer to 7 or 8.  I've tried to see the genius in it, but alas, I think this
is truly a step down from HOL, and definitely a step down from TD.  Don't
crucify me on this.  I still love the album.  I just feel that she let me
down.
	I wasn't expecting the ethereal.  So maybe it's just shock.  I'll just
quickly step through the tracks, and leave it until I finish my analysis.

The Sensual World - A great opener.
Love and Anger - "Big Sky" take two.  I didn't think BS was terribly
    wonderful, and wouldn't have asked for another.
The Fog - Hard to say.  Occasionally I've found it intense, but normally I
    find it quite boring.  Haven't determined why yet.
Reaching Out - Does the synth line in this remind anyone else of Quadrophenia?
    I think the vocals on this track are incredible.
Heads We're Dancing - I really like this one.  I shouldn't (it's too poppy for
    my tastes), but I do.  Catchy I guess is the best word.  What feeling!!
Deeper Understanding - Black box...does Kate have a NeXT?  Gee, this one sort
    of hits home for some reason :-)
Between a Man and a Woman - I am captivated by the delivery of the opening
    lyrics, which she promptly drops, never to be heard again...this
    disappointed me.  I don't like the rest of the song as much.
Never Be Mine - Interesting perspective.
Rocket's Tail - I'll jump on the bandwagon and brand this the best song on the
    album.  Textures, vocals, Gilmour...all perfect.
This Woman's Work - I'm glad she put this on the album.  Definitely a plus.
Walk Straight Down the Middle - eh.  Doesn't do much for me.

	I'm sure you're all terribly happy I bothered to post that.  Oh, a
couple other things.  I've been trying to push these idiots around here into
displaying the album a little more prominently.  I've been somewhat
successful.  Even talked one of the sales people into buying it.  And WHFS has
been playing tracks from the album pretty routinely.  Nobody else around here
would play Kate, so I haven't been listening for it.  Hopefully I'll have a
more in depth review in a few days.  Until then...
