Thanks to Steve Wallis for posting the Radio One interview...or so far 
at least the first part of it.

In that interview Kate talks about _Rocket's_Tail_, a truely awesome
piece of work...

&gt; KT: About _Rocket's_Tail_?  Oh God, you would ask me about that one &lt;laughs&gt;.
&gt; I wrote this for the trio, really, musically, in that I wanted a song that
&gt; could really show them off.  

Then after explaining how she crafted the Trio's part in _Rocket's_Tail_...

&gt; RS: Rocket is one of your cats.
&gt; 
&gt; KT: Rocket *is* one of my cats, and he was the inspiration for the subject
&gt; matter for the song, because he's dead cute &lt;both laugh&gt;.  And it's very
&gt; strange subject matter because the song isn't exactly about Rocket, it's kind
&gt; of inspired by him and for him, but the song, it's about anything.  I guess
&gt; it's saying there's nothing wrong with being right here at this moment, and
&gt; just enjoying this moment to its absolute &lt;something&gt;, and if that's it,
&gt; that's OK, you know.  And it's kind of using the idea of a rocket that's so
&gt; exciting for maybe 3 seconds and then it's gone &lt;phutt!&gt;, you know that's it,
&gt; but so what, it had 3 seconds of absolutely wonderful... &lt;both laugh&gt;

While in the _New_Musical_Express_ interview, Kate said...

&gt; "Rocket's my cat,but it was written for the Bulgarian girls.  Ridiculous 
&gt; collection of images, nothing to do with Rocket, really. He just started it
&gt; all off."   

It sounds like Kate isn't entirely comfortable talking about this song.
I can only imagine that this means something to her personally.

Could it be about Kate's feelings about her own fame?  Once every three
years or so she launches herself into the public view once again.  Fame
can be so wonderful but at the same time it can be a very lonely thing.

At the beginning of the song its almost as though she's telling someone 
else (perhaps one of her collaboraters, Gilmore or Gabriel?) that they
must be crazy to go on this rocket ride, it may be great for a short
time but you can also end up burnt out and alone.

And then Kate knocks us out with the irony, she's about to take that 
rocket ride again herself.  But she tells us in the interview that it's
alright now, she can live life for the moment and enjoy it.

I've just started working on this idea but I think it may be worth
consideration.

So am I nuts?
