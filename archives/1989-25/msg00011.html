I've been reading this group for a while and recommending Kate
Bush to various friend, but only on the basis of _Hounds of Love_
and _The Whole Story_.  Just last week I finally got around to
borrowing some Kate Bush albums from a friend so I could check
them out.  I got _Lionheart_, _Never For Ever_, and _The
Dreaming_.

Since then I've pretty much been listening to only _The
Dreaming_.  On _Lionheart_ Kate sounds just a little too
munchkin-like for me to stand right now, although I'm not
rejecting the album so much as leaving it lower on the priority
list.  I'll listen to it when I get tired of the other stuff.  I
took one pass through _Never For Ever_ and liked it better, but I
just can't stop listening to _The Dreaming_.  Obviously all these
stories about people who couldn't stand it on first hearing are
about people with very different musical tastes than I have.
When I first put it on and it started with "Sat in Your Lap" I
just sort of ho-hummed through it, since I've heard that enough
before.  But then all the new songs started, and I was entranced.
I have a hard time characterizing the music I like except that I
tend to prefer stuff that I would describe as weird and intense,
and _The Dreaming_ has plenty of that.  Yum.

Then today I decided I would go on a quest for _The Sensual
World_, in order that I could fully OD on KT.  The first two
stores I checked said, basically, "We had it in but it's much
more popular than we thought it was going to be so we're sold
out."  The second store was, interestingly enough, playing it on
their house system; as I was wandering around trying to get the
lay of the place (difficult since my 'chair wouldn't fit through
most of their aisles) I kept thinking "Gosh, that sounds a lot
like Kate they're playing", but none of it was familiar.  Soon
enough I heard the Kate-like voice singing the words "between a
man and a woman" and realized that this indeed must be the new
album.  I was tempted to hang around the store to hear more songs
but decided to look at a third store.  Fortunately, the third
store had multiple copies, so now all I have to do is get the
album over to where I can listen to it.  In Eugene, Oregon, at
least, the album seems to be selling pretty rapidly.
