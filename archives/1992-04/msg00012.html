&gt; &gt; Geez, can you say "hypersensitive"?
&gt; ...
&gt; &gt;  Therefore, I can sincerely say to anyone who was offended
&gt; &gt; by my previous posting - plllltttt!
&gt;
&gt; so, let me get this straight.  you're bothered that we were bothered
&gt; and expressed our disapproval, so you're expressing your disapproval?
&gt;
&gt; classic dweeb...

The fact that you had such vehement "disapproval" shows that
you do indeed need to Get A Life, as Steve Berlin suggested.
As far as your "classic dweeb" comeback, let me say it was
utterly brilliant (not), and the final, overwhelming proof to
the old adage... "It takes one to know one..."

I think Steve Berlin's and Neil Calton's musings were amusing
and probably hit a bit uncomfortably close to home for some
people.  I don't have time to dig down and grab up Vickie's
quotes, but Vickie, as I alluded to in my email to you,
feminists, and Katefans as well, need to  _lighten up_.

That Steve's post should bring on such flotsam and jetsam is
really crazy.

And while there are many people who are vastly
Kate-knowledgable, putting together a massive opus of Kate's
quotes doesn't make you any authority.  It makes you a good
organizer.  It's not your "work", as in an author's work, it's
the works of another essentially, that you have organized.
Often proving to be most helpful, other times proving to be
somewhat cumbersome, outdated and repetitive.  This _may_ have
been what Steve was getting at about the 10 year old
interviews.  Just a guess, I don't really like to interpret
too much of another person's intent.

By the way, I think Saurav Misra looked at it the right way.
Like, it's a joke.  SOme people have so much trouble laughing
at themselves.  Geez.

While I'm at it, the above mentioned Vickie/email referred to
Vickie making a point that I had referred to myself as a
feminist, that is, a person who believes that people of any
gender should do what they want, to their fullest potential,
blah, blah, blah, and soon thereafter referred to figure
skater Katarina Witt as having a "fat ass" and noting that she
fell a few times during an exhibition show here in Orlando a
couple years back.

Vickie felt the two were contradictory, as the term "fat ass"
implied that I supported the notion that women must be
Vogue-thin or anorexic looking to fit the American image of
"attractive".

If anyone took it that way, belive me, I do NOT feel that way.
Women and men are attractive, at least to _me_, in many shapes
and sizes.  However, Katarina Witt did indeed look fat-assed to
me that night, I think it affected her performance somewhat,
and if Brian Boitano or any male skater had looked that way,
rest assured I would have called him "fat-assed" with
unf;linching hesitation. (that's unflinching, my fingers are
tired.)

Hence, the idea that once you label yourself as a feminist or a
communist or a donkey-fucker, people slap a whole set of values
and attitudes on you, as if they are "correct" or "not correct"
according to the label yo wear.  So, that's why i said to
Vickie that, while _some_ (stupid) people might have
interpreted my "fat-assed" comment to mean that I thought only
thin women were attractive, at the same time, "feminists" (as
well as others) need to lighten up sometimes too, and not read
alot of stuff into a remark that simply isn't there.

In summmation, I believe in many feminist ideas, yet the
truth of the matter is, there are no fatso figure skaters in
the Olympics.  Male or female.  Katarina Witt, while a pretty
woman, had, in my opinion, put on a bit of weight and was
carrying it mostly in her hiney, therefore, the term
"fat-assed" leapt to mind, and I still stand by it.  The term,
not Katarina's ass. ;-)

Don't label me, you'll only end up confused as well as
probably wrong.

Later,

Cynthia
