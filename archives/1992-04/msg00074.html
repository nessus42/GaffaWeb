 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; [|&gt;oug on Danielle Dax:] These two records are combined on one
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Japanese import CD called *Up Amongst The Golder Spires*.
 &gt;   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 &gt;&gt; Pardon me while I wipe the drool off my chin... would you please give a
 &gt;&gt; label name and catalog # if you know them?  I had always thought that 
 &gt;&gt; this stuff was out of print on LP and unavailable on CD.  Are any tracks
 &gt;&gt; omitted?  How much (gulp) did it cost?
 &gt;
 &gt;First off, I should make a slight correction.  "Golder" up there
 &gt;should be replaced with "Golden" -- *Up Amongst The Golden Spires*.
 &gt;Sorry for the typo.  I don't have the CD here -- I'll have to remember
 &gt;to write down info on it when I go home.  Remind me if I forget.  I

Whilst on the subject, I heard of a Japanese-only Dax recording (LP or
CD I don't know - back in '87 or '88) called "The Chemical Wedding".
I _think_ that at the time it was the only place to get some new song 
called "Cat-House" (could be wrong though!).  Was my information off,
and it was actually referring to "...Golden Spires" in a pre-release
(or whatever) title, or has anybody heard of an object like this.

Oh, and did the UATGS have a Holly Warburton cover (a good enough reason
to seek out those old 12" singles on their own)?

ObKT: I waited and waited for the Rocket Man single, and in the first
week of January I finally found a (read: ONE) copy in one of the two import
records stores in town, and promptly forked out $17 for it.  I wasn't too
impressed when one week later, UK copies were available in the normal
record stores for $5.  Makes you want to eat your own intestines, doesn't
it?  If only I felt it had been worth it...
