&gt;&gt; Interesting, Doug. I had always interpreted that line to mean, "When they 
&gt;&gt; call me on the phone, I let my answering machine let them (i.e. their voice) 
&gt;&gt; into the room.", like when people screen their calls.

&gt;Exactly what I thought.

Mmm I had never thought that.

&gt;&gt; Does the term "to ring" mean to visit, in addition to meaning to call on
&gt;&gt; the telephone, in British English?

&gt;No!

I don't really tihnk it's used here, either. you might "call" on
someone, and that would mean dropping by physically, not telephoning,
but i can't actuall ytihnk of anyone using "ring" to mean stopping by.
However, I've always assumed that's what Kate meant in the song. I'm
not qute sure why, but it seems a logical use of the word in my mind.

&gt;Also, (pedantic trival point) KaTe must have written most of TD during
&gt;1981, when she was 22-23 - some time before 25 8^).

Perhaps it's not unusual for people to feel a lot of stress,etc.. at
25, but might i point out that kate is far from usual ;) But serious,
I think making the generalization at all isn't a good idea unless
really good surveys have been done, and recently.  I don't know many
people who've all had stressful periods at the same ages. or maybe
people these days are just more diverse in experiences than they used
to be - increased education and communication probably leads to this.
