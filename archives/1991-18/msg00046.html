1) COME HERE


   I see you almost every day
    You sing the words 
     That I might say
     
   So don't you think that 
    We could have something dear?
     Come here and let me 
      Show you what I think

           Come here                Come here
              Come here                Come here
          Come here                Come here
                Come here                Come here

             I want to feel you in the dark, babe
   
                         Come here
                             Come home

   I see in you
    A million stars
     I know that you'll
      Go very far

   I only want to 
    Know you better babe
     Give me the time to 
      Show you what matters

           Come here                Come here
              Come here                Come here
          Come here                Come here
                Come here                Ahhhhh 

            I want to feel you in the dark, babe
   
                        Come here
                            Come home

   Maybe you know me 
    I'm right inside your closet
     Open the door 
      And let me out

   If you can free me 
    Then maybe we can play there
     All you have to do 
      Is look my way

           Come here                Come here
              Come here                Come here
          Come here                Come here
                Come here                Ahhhhh

            I want to feel you in the dark, babe
   
                        Come here
                            Come home

   Can you tell me 
    Why I shouldn't love you?
     Maybe I have something 
      You might like

   Be still (shhhhhh) relax
    And let me have your hand, babe
     Come with the one 
      Who'll love you as a man

           Come here                Come here
              Come here                Come here
          Come here                Come here
                Come here                Ahhhhh

             I want to feel you in the dark, babe
   
                        Come here
                            Come home

           Come here                Come here
              Come here                Come here
          Come here                Come here
                Come here                Come here

                I want to feel you in the dark

2) THE REVELATION


   There is no sun
   There's only moon
   It comes too late
   It comes too soon

         The only reality
          Isn't real at all

   There are no dreams (Mikey)
   There is no sleep
   There are no treasures
   For this little girl
   To keep

         The only reality
          Isn't real at all
 
   I know life (Mikey)
   Is a relative term
   And I won't live until
   I'm lying with the worms

          The only reality
           Isn't real at all
 
   There is no love (Mikey)
   There is no peace
   There's only me
   And my beast

         The only reality
          Isn't real at all

         The only reality
          Is you and me

  
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 


3) MANY NIGHTS


   Tonight, tonight
   And for many nights

     Although I am not very real
     Am I something you can love?

  {repeat...}


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


4) UNDER AND OVER THE BRINK


   On the brink of complying
     I'm very slow
   And I say to myself:

   "Oh no, don't go
     Well I like you the way you are
   So please don't change
     Don't you know that your mind could rearrange?"

   So today it starts and tomorrow it ends
     I lost my soul and I lost my friends
   So today it ends and tomorrow it starts
     The brooding of a million hearts

         Music's the way, the only way I know
           It's time to let the brooding heart
         Choose the way to go

        'Cause love is not the answer
           It's never here to stay
         What's here through the night 
           May be gone by day

   On the brink of attack
     I'm society prone
   And they're telling me: 

     "You should find out what is wrong"

   I think I'm alright
     I'm still putting up a fight
   But I keep on losing
     Soon I'll be dying of fright

   On the brink of insanity
     I see my friend
   And I'm trying to tell him:

    "It can't be the end
   Well, you've made me live
     Now you've got more to give"

   If he goes o'er that brink
     Who will I cry with?
 
         Because music's the way, the only way I know
           It's time to let the brooding heart
         Choose the way to go

        'Cause love is not the answer
           It's never here to stay
         What's here through the night 
           May be gone by day
         What's here through the night 
           May be gone by day

 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


5) LET ME KNOW, LOVE


   I wish you could feel what I do now
    Knowing what or why but never how

   It's hard making the emotions turn around
    The ones you want lost and never found

      Ooh can you feel it yet, love?
       Let me know when you do, love

   You know what it's like to disappoint yourself
    You store your confidence on a shelf
       (Let me know when you do)

   You hate the world for its influence on you
    You hate your heart for betraying you

      Can you feel it yet, love?
       Let me know when you do, love
 
   I can't get rid of those ugly things
    When peace flies over I miss its wings
       (Let me know when you do)

   I want to be the person in my dreams
    I find it harder than it seems

      Ooh can you feel it yet, love?
       Let me know when you do, love


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


6) WHERE DO I GO?


   I stepped on a life
   A living emotion
   I murdered the concept of devotion

   Oh lord..lord..let me die
   Or let me live not another lie

   I crushed a soul
   A soul like mine
   Oh lord, what was in my mind?

   Oh lord

        Where..where do I go from here?
        Oh lord..oh lord

   Let me get it back
   The heart inside
   Let me live again
   Give me back my pride

   All the faith that you had 
   Can be born again
   Despite the bad ways of the girl
   With the purest of hearts
   Can you believe she's making a start?

   Baby I want to live
   I'm not ready to die
   Don't want to make my precious few cry

   Oh lord

        Where..where do I go from here?
        Oh lord..oh lord

   Oh lord while I'm young
   Don't take the breath from my lungs
   I will start again
   Oh babe with all of my friends
   They will trust in me lord
   Until the very end

   I stepped on a life   (I stepped on a life)
   A living emotion      (A living emotion)
   I murdered the concept of devotion

   Oh lord

        Oh lord..lord
        Let me die or let me live


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


7) NOT FOR ME


   No not for me
   Brutal simplicity
    Sane insincerity

   No not another day
   Wasted away
    On a mental stray

        Where is the man of my dreams?
         Where is the man of my dreams?

   Who will be the one 
   To keep me from the sun?
    Ready and willing to run

   It's too, too far
   To all my perfect stars
    Nonexistent are

        Where is the man of my dreams?
         Where is the man of my dreams?

   Keep your life
   Keep your normal wife
    Live your tiny plant life

   No, not for me
   I tear instinctively
    And wish for idiocy


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


8) ONE ALIEN


              The spirit in me
     Knows your soul will be free

             One alien has come, unalien to one

                   Will they ever return 
   To bring you back to where you belong?

                   You'll find a place
                     Of peaceful grace
          You've fought from the start
   For the road to all of their hearts

                   Will they ever return 
   To bring you back to where you belong?

    Baby I'm here and I've been quite an alien too
                    I'm on a road that's parallel to you
    Baby I'm here and I've been quite an alien too
                    I'm on a road that's parallel to you

            Your love's too pure
       And your motives too sure
          A society cannot stand 
             A truly genuine man

                   Will they ever return 
   To bring you back to where you belong?


     Baby I'm here and I've been quite an alien too
                     I'm on a road that's parallel to you
     Baby I'm here and I've been quite an alien too
                     I'm on a road that's parallel to you

             The spirit in me
   Knows your soul will be free

         One alien has come, unalien to one
               One alien has come, unalien to one
  Alien has come, unalien to one

1) NOONE HERE


   I feel warm and whole
   But there's noone here
   Yes, and mine's a heavy soul
   But there's noone here

                                        sun
                                     my    is
                                 Look        rising
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

      And it's rising over there
      But there's noone here
      There's noone here
      I'm without a body
      To keep me warm
      And not even a kitty
      To share my storm

   Well I know what I need
   But there's noone here
   And I know just where I bleed
   But there's noone here      ` 
                                `
                                 `
                                        sun
                                     my    is
                                 Look        rising
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

      And it's rising over there
      But there's noone here
      There's noone here
      And I'm without a body
      To keep me warm
      And not even a kitty
      To share my storm

   Well I want a warm brain
   But there's noone here
   'Cause mine's under a strain
   And there's noone here

                                        sun
                                     my    is
                                 Look        rising
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      And it's rising over there
      But there's noone here
      There's noone here
      And I'm without a body    ^ ^
      To keep me warm           * *
      And not even a kitty       +      ^ ^
      To share my storm                 * *

tu) to the funnyfarm


   i'm on my way
    i can feel it coming on
  my brain's been strained of all reality

     i'm on my way
   to the funnyfarm
    and when i go i'll bring with me
  both of my bros

      i've lost my way
    through this world of profanities and
     i thrive on the wind and the rain and the cold
  i've lost my way
    through this world of profanities
   and i'll not find it before i'm very old

      i need reassurance that i'll always be insane
     i want my teddy bear to lay on
       and when i go
    i'll be efficient at making ashtrays
     when i go
       i'll do nothing but catch me moonrays


           For I know what you don't know 
           And I see things you'll never see 
           And I've a different way of living you know 
           And I've such a different frame of mind 
           And

   so...

    i'm on my way 
   to the funnyfarm
     and when i go i'll bring with me 
    both of my bros

3) ASYLUM MASTER


   Oh silent moving chill
   It's looking bleak
   You're not mine to touch and
   I dare not speak
   I need your presence 
   Be you dead or alive
   My misery demands 
   Your company to survive

            The living, breathing corpse
            Whose shadow rightly
            Before me walks
  
   Only in your eyes lies your soul
   And only in your arms am I whole
   So damn your father for loving your mother
   I curse him
   For now I want no other
  
            The living, breathing corpse
            Whose shadow rightly
            Before me walks

   Master of the round walls 
   Still my heart
   It only makes my dreams fall apart
   Trap me in your courtyard
   Of broken stone
   Oh it's cold and grey but
   I'll not be alone

            The living, breathing corpse
            Whose shadow rightly
            Before me walks

4) BEAT IT OUT


   DWINDLE DAY, YOUR FLICKERING RAY
   PUT TO REST, SO THAT I MAY LAY

   TO CHURN AND ROLL
   ON THE FLOOR
   AND BEAT IT OUT, AND BEAT IT OUT

   GOT TO GET IT OUT
   GOT TO GET IT OUT
   [REPEAT]

5) THE CHASE

   ||   My feet are failing me
   ||   I need to rest
   ||   My mind is killing me
   ||   And it's doing its best
   ||
   ||   The chase is on, and I'm losing
   ||   And I'm trying to run, my legs are refusing
   ||   And I can feel his cold breath
   ||   Lingering like death
   ||
   ||   Can't go any faster, I think I'm beat
   ||  I feel the disaster
   ||   And I feel the lack of his heat
   ||   The chase is on, and I'm losing
   ||   And I'm trying to run, my legs are refusing
   ||   And I can feel his cold breath
   ||   Clinging to my neck
   ||
   ||   I'm running toward you
   ||    Don't fail me now
   ||    I don't live life so well
   ||    I need you to show me how
   ||
   ||    The chase is on, and I'm losing
   ||    And I'm dying to run, my legs are refusing
   ||    And I can feel his cold breath
   ||    And it's lingering like death
   ||    And I can feel his cold cold breath
   ||    And it's clinging to my neck
   ||
   ||    The chase is on
   ||    The chase is on
   ||    The chase is on
   ||    The chase is on
   ||    The chase is on
   ||    The chase is on
   ||    The chase is on
   ||    The chase is on
   ||
   ||    And I can feel his breath
   ||    And it's on the back of my leg
   ||    And I can feel his breath
   ||    And it's on the back of my leg
   ||  
   ||    And I want your hand
   ||    And I want your love
   ||
   ||    I want your hand
   ||    I want your hand
   ||    I need your love
   ||    I need your love
   ||    I want your hand
   ||    I want your hand
   ||    I need your love
   ||    I need your love
   ||
   ||    I need you to be strong
