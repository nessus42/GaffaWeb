Greg sez:

&gt;thank you thank you thank you Jeff, Vickie, Chris, et al, for the Happy
&gt;lyrics!  i'm waiting desperately for "Would That I Could" (sic?) from
&gt;Ecto -- up there with RUTH for leaving me dazed and blind with rapture
&gt;(which is awkward while driving, BTW;  but what a way to go!)

Well, geez, all ya gotta do is ask!

_Ecto_ is the one album "we" always had the lyrics to (Happy sent 'em to
Vickie KaTe-knows-when; Vickie sent me a xerox of 'em, oh, geez, a couple
of months ago).  I've sent out the _Ecto_ lyrics to a bunch of people.

In addition, if you'd been a good boy and read your Shakespeare as a child,
you would have at least realized that "Would That I Could" at least has
*something* to do with _A Midsummer Night's Dream_.  In fact, all of the
lyrics except for the chorus are straight from the play (the beginning of
Act II scene i).

Realizing that not everyone has a bunch of Shakespeare lying around, here,
for your reading pleasure, is "Would That I Could"


"Would That I Could"

Over hill, over dale	thorough bush, thorough brier
Over park, over dale	thorough flood, thorough fire

	Would that I could, I'd be serving my Titania
	Would that I could, I'd never return
	Would that I could, I'd be loving my Oberon
	Would that I could, I'd stay for good

I do wander everywhere, swifter than the moon's sphere
And I serve the fairy queen, to dew her orbs upon the green

    Would that I could, I'd be serving my Titania
    Would that I could, I'd never return
    Would that I could, I'd be loving my Oberon
    Would that I could, I'd stay for good

The cowslips tall her pensioners be: in their gold coats spots you see
Those be rubies, fairy favours, in those freckles live their savours

    Would that I could, I'd be serving my Titania
    Would that I could, I'd never return
    Would that I could, I'd be loving my Oberon
    Would that I could, I'd stay for good

I must go seek some dewdrops here, and hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear
Farewell thou lob of spirits, I'll be gone
Our queen and all her elves come here anon.

    Would that I could, I'd be serving my Titania
    Would that I could, I'd never return
    Would that I could, I'd be loving my Oberon
    Would that I could, I'd stay for good

Excerpts of "Would That I Could" taken from A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
by William Shakespeare

There.  Now that that's done, I have a question of my own:

Did Vickie 'n Chris post the _Rearmament_ lyrics the other night?  All I
got at my site were Volumes I and II and I'm *dying* to see the fully lyrics
to "'Til the Dawn Breaks".


Note:  the lyrics that Happy sent to Vickie for _Ecto_ contain a number of
errors.  When I typed up my copy of the xerox, I fixed a couple of the
errors, but not all of them.  Vickie told me a while ago that she has a
complete, error-free machine-readable copy of the lyrics.  I assume she's
going to post those to the net when she has a chance.  For this reason
I'm not going to post my own text file of the lyrics.  If anybody would
like them as they stand, please e-mail me for a copy.

Jeff
