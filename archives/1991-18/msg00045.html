1) RAINKEEPER


   Ooh rainlover
   You're the one
   You're the one I'm dreaming of
   Be my love

   Ooh rainkeeper
   Does your heart..
   Does it overflow with fear?
   You and I could cry a sea

       'Cause I'm the other side
        Know where you hide
        I'm there
        So be wary of me rainlover
        In my dreams
        You are lying by me
        And we're free

   Ooh rainmaker
   Do you know..
   Do you know where my love goes?
   Only mother knows

        That I'm the other half
        The psychopath
        I'm here
        Better fear me
        Your other side
        Know where you hide
        I'm there
        So be wary of me rainkeeper

   Time to die
   And she wants you by her side
   Forces to collide

2) OH THE DREARS


   (((((((  Oh the drears  )))))))
   (((((((  Oh the drears  )))))))

   Oh the drears of being so strong
   Oh the drears of never being wrong

     It's such a strain
     To find the strength within
     And such a drain to fight and always win

   Oh the drears of the cold cold night
   Oh the drears of seeing death in our sight

     And knowing every moment
     That what I feel is true
     The drears of knowing that I'll make it through

               Oh the drears
                  the drears

        ((((((((((((   Oh  ))))))))))))
                 
   Oh the drears of the nights are creeping
   Oh the drears are never sleeping

     It's such a strain
     To find the strength within
     And such a drain to fight and always win
     And such a drain to fight and always win

   (((((((  Oh the drears )))))))

3) GIVEN IN


         I have my pain
         I have my love
            And my hate

   And I'll not live without one of them
   And I do what I can to keep on top of every one of them

   I've got to live by the rules of my heart
   And to trust my feeble mind
   And I do what I can to keep on top of every one of them

         Oh child be strong in all you do
         Know your heart through and through

         Oh child be strong in all you do
         Know your heart through and through

   I have a friend who's been inside my tiny brain
   He's seen the aging and the mildew from the rain
   He does what he can to keep on top of every one of them

   At last I know what's in my soul and in my bones
   The things that cannot be denied

   And I do what I can to keep on top of every one of them
   I do what I can to ward away the very death of them

         Oh child be strong in all you do
         Know your heart through and through

         Oh child be strong in all you do
         Know your heart through and through

4) HE'S ALIVE         {"Alice" is one of Happy's monster paintings}


   He's alive
   He's alive
   And why?
   Because I let him live
   
      Open your eyes

      Alice arise

   Take my breath
   Breath my life
   Come through the walls
   Your lady calls

   Lean on me
   There's no captivity
   Roam the streets
   Invade their dreams

   He's alive
   He's alive
   And why?
   Because I let him live
   
      Open your eyes

      Alice arise

   Take my breath
   Breath my life
   Come through the walls
   Your lady calls

   Lean on me
   There's no captivity
   Roam the streets
   Invade their dreams

       He is alive
       He is alive

5) POSSESSED    [Music by Happy - Lyrics by Happy and Dave Snyder]


   Ooh don't hate me if I break under the strain

   Analyzed, crucified
   Caught on Satan's wing
   Angels of night
   Vultures in flight
   I've a love for the fatal things

      All these and many more
      Float within my lobes
      Colors dancing
      Blood-red oozing
      From liquid strobes

   Come see the visions
   Come feel the pain 
   Of sores that never heal
   And then my friend
   Well, maybe you'll see
   How my world's
   Become unreal

      Kissing the night
      And cursing the morning
      Must be a crime
      Dismembered
      From the faith of youth
      And doing my time

   Culture-shocked eyes 
   That hide the fears
   Eroded cheeks 
   From acid tears
   Where every smile
   Escapes from my face
   To seek refuge
   In a happier place

      And my mind
      It screams to be free
      And to find the structure
      My mind
      It screams to be free
      From what's possessing me

   Now don't hate me if I break under the strain

6) I'LL LET YOU GO


   Ultimately, I'll let you go
   I'll let you go
   And ultimately, I'll let you go
   I'll let you go

       But the pain will come and eat away at my soul

   Frequently, I've let you go
   I've let you go
   Frequently, I've let you go
   I've let you go

       And the pain has come and it ate away at my soul

       That's how I know

   That ultimately, I'll let you go
   I'll let you go
   And ultimately, I'll let you go
   I'll let you go


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


7) NUMBER ONE


   The day must come for us to begin
   The ways away from the craze we're in

      These hand are yours
      Baby to hold in your own
      Now don't let them go
      Don't leave them alone

   I'm not a child of righteous birth
   I live my pain for all it's worth

      I never wanted
      Baby to bring you down
      To grind and pound
      You into the ground

          You are the shine in the hollow of my eye
          And my time whiles by faster with you by my side

   Don't want for you to lose the smile
     (shine in the hollow of my eye)
   That keeps my heart apart from the bile
 
      So run within
      Baby fly with my brain
      Enter the realm 
      Of mental strain

   What comes ahead is something I fear
     (shine in the hollow of my eye)
   I am what you feel and not what you hear

      Now love and life and I
      We don't get along
      So help me be strong
      Where I don't belong

          You are the shine in the hollow of my eye
          And oh my pain slithered away
          Hey baby, when you asked me to stay
 
          You are the shine in the hollow of my eye
          And my time whiles by faster with you by my side
          Faster with you by my side
          Faster with you by my side
          Faster with you by my side

8) CASE OF GLASS


   Oh how I could keep you 
   Inside a case of glass
   Filled with smells of sweet
   With handles made of brass

   I'd keep you from cruel world
   Living safe and warm
   I'd lie and watch you breathe
   Protect and love your form

       If you ever wander
       I pray that you will find
       A love equal in power 
       With limits undefined
 
   But such a lack of nobility
   Would be a deed unjust
   But I want to keep my faith in love 
   And sadly so, I must

       So if you ever wander
       I pray that you will find
       A love equal in power 
       With limits undefined

       If you ever wander
       I pray that you will find
       A love equal in power 
       With limits undefined

   But I could keep you
   Inside a case of glass

Side B

2) I'm Not Awake, I'm Not Asleep
3) The First To Cry
4) Step Inside
5) The Wretches Gone Awry
--------------------------------


1) MOONBEAM FRIENDS


   Waiting on my slumber
    They rest upon my pane
     My tiny moonbeam friends
      Clinging to my rain

       And when I lift my shade 
        They quietly fall through
         They land upon my wall
          Sparkling of blue

           And when I cry
            They sing to me
             My little lunar friends
 
      For every hurt my heart can feel
     They try to make amends

   One of them I know
    I call him by his name
     He has a special cause
      To keep this child insane

       They make me warm inside
        When everything is cold
         My heart is burning young
          My mind grows old
   
           The painted stage
            It comes alive at night
             When all the world is dead
 
      And I become the sole audience
     And they linger in my head

   Now follow me my loves
    Everywhere I go
     Shine on every hair
      My oxy and nitro
  
       We have the world tonight
        So keep me company
         And when the sun comes 
          We will be history
 
           Now watch me in my troubled sleep
            My spirits of the night
             And be nocturnal for me still
 
      Be gone with the light
     Be gone with the light

2) I'M NOT AWAKE, I'M NOT ASLEEP


   I hear wind, moving trees
   My hand's being sqeezed
         But I'm not awake and I'm not asleep
   Under feet, the steps are cold
   My eyes are feeling old
         I'm not awake, I'm not asleep
   A leaf fell, but didn't land
   And the squeeze left my hand
         I'm not alone, someone's here
   He is in this place
   I have his legs near my face
         He's not awake, he's not asleep
   I'm hidden out of sight
   I move freely in the night
         I'm not awake, and I'm not asleep
   I hear horses running by
   And there's a storm in the sky
         I'm not awake, I'm not asleep
   Ahhhhhhhhh.........................


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


3) THE FIRST TO CRY


   I have no heart it seems
   When I need it, it leaves
   And I haven't the courage to oblige

   Why couldn't somebody cry for me
   This time?
   For I'm too frightened to reply

   As were the days of yore
   Mine are timeless

   Why couldn't somone have patience for me?
   Why couldn't someone be wise to my fears?
   Tell me why couldn't sombody cry for me
   This time?
  
   And if I should die, who'll be the first to cry?

   I have not the nerve to show anyone how I am
   For I'd be misunderstood
 
   Every time you're standing by my side
   I'm stricken with undying fear inside

   And if I choose to comply
   Not one would wonder why would I 
   Who'll be the first to cry?


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


4) STEP INSIDE


   All's quiet now
   Step inside, step inside
  
   All's quiet now
   Step inside, step inside
        My mind
   Experience the other side
 
   I'm crying now
   Step inside, step inside

   I'm crying now
   Step inside, step inside
        My mind
   Experience the other side

        You're never safe in this atmosphere
        Do you want to be?
        You could be trapped inside of me
        Do you want to be?

   Are you alone?
   Step inside, step inside

   All alone?
   Step inside, step inside
        My mind 
   Experience the other side
 
        You're never safe in this atmosphere
        Do you want to be?
        You could be trapped inside of me
        Do you want to be?
 
   Easily frightened?
   Step inside, step inside

   Easily frightened?
   Step inside, step inside
        My mind
   Experience the other side

5) THE WRETCHES GONE AWRY


   Mine are like the wings of a butterfly
    A dusty pair so,
   Don't you touch them or I'll never fly anywhere

       And the wretches have gone awry I saw them walk on by

   Ever see the wings of a dragonfly?
    Paper-thin and cellophane
   And quickly broken like the will to live for a mind in pain

       And the wretches have gone awry I saw them walk on by  

                  I cannot change what is and
                 I cannot make it die
                  But I can love with all my heart 
                 The wretches gone awry

       And the wretches have gone awry I saw them walk on by
 
   You know I can be rid of my time and the moon will always shine
   'Cause he knows I need him to walk this vile and crooked line

       And the wretches have gone awry I saw them walk on by
  
   And you can own all the light in the world and still be blind
    And lie and hide away from the people in the world and still be kind

       And the wretches have gone awry I saw them walk on by

                  I cannot change what is and
                 I cannot make it die
                  But I can love with all my heart 
                 The wretches gone awry

       And the wretches have gone awry I saw them walk on by

   All I ask is you let me be to live like I do
    I'll never be part but someday I will pass on through

       And the wretches have gone awry I saw them walk on by 

   You can pull the wings from a dragonfly
    And you can kill the flight of a butterfly
   But you can't harm me for I live with the freedom to decide

       And the wretches have gone awry I saw them walk on by

                  You cannot change what is and
                 You cannot make it die
                  But you can love with all your heart
                 The wretches gone awry

           Say

                  You cannot change what is and
                 You cannot make it die
                  But you can love with all your heart
                 The wretches gone awry

       Yes the wretches have gone awry I saw them walk on by
