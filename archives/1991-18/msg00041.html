1. In the May 24 issue of the _San Jose Mercury News_, David Plotnikoff's
Pop Music column includes the following:

     "Our own Top 10:  Wherein members of the local music community tell
us what songs are getting heavy play in their homes and cars.  This week's
list comes from Rebecca Smith, San Jose music consultant and promoter."

The list that follows includes:  "8. 'This Woman's Work,' Kate Bush".

For the record, the other songs on her list are:

1. How Much is Enough -- The Fixx
2. She Still Loves Him -- Jellyfish
3. Crime Stories -- M.C. Hammer
4. She's So Sunshine -- Grey Matter
5. I've Been Thinking About You -- Londonbeat
6. I Touch Myself -- Divinyls
7. Black Boys on Mopeds -- Sinead O'Connor
9. Soul Mining -- The The
10. Bring -- Legal Reins

2.  I finally got the June issue of _Q_ magazine with the Q Sleevenotes
on _Hounds Of Love_.  I noticed that in the magazine they mention the
Prince/Kate rumor.  Is this one of the places people first heard it?  They
say:  "Prince and Kate Bush collaborating?  Surely not, yet the rumour
is rife and confirmations or denials held, perhaps significantly, in
abeyance."

3.  I was in Tower Books, Mountain View, and the stereo there was tuned
to KITS.  You guessed it -- they started playing RUTH.  It's really
quite amazing how many times I've heard that song on the radio lately
-- at least five times in May alone.  Yet I remember other periods where
I wouldn't hear that song for months.  Strange.

4. They've opened a new Tower Records store in Dublin, California!  So
there's finally a decent store for new records reasonably close to 
Livermore.  I used to have to drive about 30 miles to Concord, which is
where the closest Tower Records store used to be.  There's still no
decent used record store in this area.

I went there today to check it out.  They have all seven of Kate's albums
in both CD and cassette formats -- the first time I've seen this in any
store in the Tri-Valley area.

While there I picked up the June issue of _Pulse!_ magazine, which came
out today.  Somebody includes Kate in her Desert Island Discs list.  In
fact, this is the third month in a row that someone has listed Kate in
such a list.  Frances Chan of _RTR Countdown_ of Auckland, New Zealand
lists:

"8. _Hounds of Love_ -- Kate Bush.  For when I get sick of listening to
angry young men."

For the record, her other choices are:

1. Gone to Earth -- David Sylvian
2. The Smiths -- The Smiths
3. Skylarking -- XTC
4. Soul Mining -- The The
5. Colour of Spring -- Talk Talk
6. Hup -- Wonderstuff
7. Happiness -- Beloved
9. It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back -- Public Enemy
10. World Clique -- Deee-Lite

5.  You know that mystery song I told you about a couple of days ago?
The one that a lot of people thought was produced by Kate?  Well, the
producer turns out to be Howard Jones.  I don't know if this is a slur
against Kate or a compliment for Mr. Jones.  I still don't know what the
title or artist of the song is.
