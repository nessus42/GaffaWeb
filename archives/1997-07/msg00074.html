&gt;&gt;Just writing to express how I've felt about Kate Bush, probably my
&gt;&gt;favorite artist.  I'm disappointed and have felt that she really doesn't
&gt;&gt;have anymore interest in making any more albums.  She's left her loyal
&gt;&gt;fans hanging in the dark.  I'm wondering if anyone has felt this way as
&gt;&gt;well.  Kate Bush fans have really been superlative to her, which other
&gt;&gt;artist has such a devoted cult following?  Kate's really let us down.
&gt;
&gt;   Uh....Kate is *currently* at work making a new album. It will be
&gt;promised sometime this fall, but might actually appear sometime
&gt;in 1998...maybe. It's always like this. Kate doesn't seem to understand
&gt;that people are interested in her creative process, so she never
&gt;communicates while she's making the record. But that does not
&gt;mean that she has lost interest in making music, or her fans.

Wise words indeed.  But I would just like to add that I get REALLY annoyed
when I read comments like "Kate's really let us down" or "Kate owes us
more" or "I'm disappointed in Kate."  This really pisses me off.

I think it was Bob Dylan who said, "Just because you like my stuff doesn't
mean I owe you anything."  Get this straight, people:  Kate puts a hell of
a lot of time and effort into making a record.  You purchase the record,
and in return for this you are rewarded with the pleasure of listening to
her music.  That's it.  End of obligation on both sides.  She doesn't owe
us ANYTHING beyond that.  Get over it.

&gt;   Kate *always* puts on weight during the process of making an album,
&gt;then loses it in the period between the time its finished and when its
&gt;released. This is perfectly normal...you sit in a chair for 3 years
&gt;and see if you don't gain weight. Especially if you have a major
&gt;chocolate fixation.

I've been sitting in a chair in front of this computer for the past three
years, eating a lot of chocolate in the process, and if anything I've lost
weight.  I've also developed the most amazing sickly greenish pallor.  If
only sitting in a chair for three years made people look as gorgeous as
Kate!  For a start, the Internet would be full of nothing but gorgeous
people.  (Not that it isn't already, I hasten to add!)

&gt;   I do a daily search through the news spool for any articles
&gt;with the words "kate" and "bush" in close proximity. Occesionally
&gt;I find her name in some surprising places. The most interesting
&gt;recent one is in alt.politics.sex; the Celebacy FAQ.

So.  Someone wrote a Celibacy FAQ and didn't ask for my input, even after
all my years of experience.  I feel...cheated somehow.  (See previous items
for possible explanation.)
