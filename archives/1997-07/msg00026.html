&gt; &gt; &gt; I realy don't see the likeness either... and it makes me really angry
when
&gt; &gt; &gt; people call Tori a Kate wanna be...  I honestly don't really like
Kate...
&gt; &gt; &gt; but thats another story...
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I disagree with whomever wrote that they're *nothing* alike. I 
&gt; &gt; mean, come on, on a scale of rock artists ranging from The 
&gt; &gt; Rolling Stones to Kate Bush, you wouldn't put Tori's writing, 
&gt; &gt; singing and image smack dab in the center would you?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There are also instances, like in the "beautiful angel/peaches 
&gt; &gt; and cream" line in Prof. Widow, where the similarity is simply 
&gt; &gt; uncanny. I find it pretty hard to believe when someone says they 
&gt; &gt; just don't hear it, and always wonder why they're being so 
&gt; &gt; defensive. After all, if a Kate fan says that Tori sounds like 
&gt; &gt; Kate, it's a pretty nice compliment in my book.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think Tori would think so too. Listen closely to your tape of 
&gt; &gt; Tori live at the Greek, 6/29/96. In the middle of "Love Song," 
&gt; &gt; you'll hear Tori sing a line of "Running Up That (Rock)."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Robb
&gt; 
&gt; I've heard people say that Tori is Kate-esque since /Little 
&gt; Earthquakes/ and I never heard a line of hers that made me
&gt; go "Ooh! Katelike!" until /Boys for Pele/, and even then
&gt; it was only on a couple lines. ("Big Stripey Lie" made me
&gt; think of Tori, though...a vice versa thing.)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow, I don't think you could say "Tori is nothing like Kate,"
&gt; but I would say that, discounting gender, Tori is no more like
&gt; Kate than she is like, say, Elton John.

&gt; 
&gt; 

I always thought that "God" from Under the Pink sounded much more like Kate
than the recent Kate material.  

The comparison was inevitable given the album cover for Little Earthquakes,
especially in America.  Many in America only saw the American artwork of
Kate inside the box.  Little Earthquakes certainly seemed to be emulating
that cover.  Then the music, a passing similarity to Kate in appearance,
etc.

Is it any wonder the two are compared.

With subsequent listenings their differences became apparent and each could
be enjoyed for their own unique contributions.
