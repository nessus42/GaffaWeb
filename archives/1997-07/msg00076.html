&gt; Just writing to express how I've felt about Kate Bush, probably my
&gt; favorite artist.  I'm disappointed and have felt that she really doesn't
&gt; have anymore interest in making any more albums.  She's left her loyal
&gt; fans hanging in the dark.  I'm wondering if anyone has felt this way as
&gt; well.  Kate Bush fans have really been superlative to her, which other
&gt; artist has such a devoted cult following?  Kate's really let us down.

Funny, I didn't realize Kate owed me anything. Perhaps you sent her an advance
for her new album?

I suppose Van Gogh has let us down also; haven't seen a new painting of his in
quite a while.  But that doesn't mean I appreciate his prior work any less, or
am not grateful for what he gave this world.

To loosely paraphrase an earlier songwriter by the name of Goethe (also known
for his writings on anatomy, zoology, and his poetry, and, oh yeah, a little
snippet called Faust), a creative person doesn't get much out of repeating
what he's done already, but rather in exploring.  This in my opinion is what
Kate is and why she doesn't repetitively "perform" her works, why she did
a bronze recently, why those songs she "covers" are so special, why each album
has been unique.

If her own special songwriting muse doesn't stir again, then so be it, but as
long as she's alive and mentally well that creative spark in her will have to
flare up on occasion.  And if it results in another song that she chooses to
share (or that someone bootlegs ;-} ), I will be very grateful no matter how
long since her last.

That said,
   She's in the recording studio now?  She's in the recording studio NOW!
   Please, Kate, let it be true?!!!!!
