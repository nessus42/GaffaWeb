Hi!

First of all, what's up with the Digest now that Bill has "fixed" it?  All
of the messages are running together, and it's impossible to tell where one
ends and the next begins.  It wasn't broken before... what's up???

Anyway.

John responded:

&gt;Sounds like you got to the area right after I left.  I graduated at the 
&gt;end of 1986 and moved to TX, never to be seen or heard from again.

Yes, my first interminable summer there was 1986.

&gt;WFIT was a good station although their range was pretty limited.  If you 
&gt;got more then 10 miles away from the college, you couldn't pick them up 
&gt;at all.  That's a shame, because they did a great service to the area by 
&gt;being very open-minded in their programming.  

Not any more, alas... I think it was 3 or 4 years ago that they became a
preformatted jazz station. :P

&gt;While I was at school, I hated the station for the most part (no metal, 
&gt;you understand) but the constant exposure to it over the 4 1/2 years I 
&gt;attended school there did have an effect on a subconsious level. 

No metal, but every night from 1 to 6 am they played nonstop thrash.
(That's when I shut it off an switched to tapes. :)  They did play an album
in its entirety every night at midnight, though, which could be anything
from REM's _Document_ the week before it was released (got it on tape, I
couldn't afford to buy music then :) to the brand-new album by Mighty
Sphincter, _The New Manson Family_ (or was that the brand new album by The
New Manson Family, _The Mighty Sphincter_?  I don't think I ever knew).

&gt;Clearly 
&gt;in the case of HoL, it made an impact.  I also liked that one Smiths song 
&gt;with the heavily tremeloed guitar on it.  They played the crap out of 
&gt;that one!

"How Soon Is Now".  How soon are they going to stop playing that damn
song???  (They were still going nuts over it in 1989.)

&gt;BTW, my roommate was fired from his DJ job for playing Rush's 2112 in 
&gt;its entirity at 3am one morning.....

What on earth for???
