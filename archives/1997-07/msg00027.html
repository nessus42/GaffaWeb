&gt; Peter,
&gt; 
&gt; Having thought about it for a few days, I think there are some points
that
&gt; can be made about HOL that I'd personally hate to see overlooked in favor
&gt; of EMI gushing about sales numbers  after all, what's important to us
&gt; isn't whether an album sells a billion copies, but how it makes us feel
and
&gt; what it makes us think.
&gt; 
&gt; HOL is not only one of the most ambitious popular music undertakings of
the
&gt; 80's, it is one of the most successful.  The success is layered and
&gt; multi-leveled, like the album itself.
&gt; 
&gt; First there is the juxtaposition of the Apollonian and Dianic influence 
&gt; the bright, driven, outgoing and nearly anthemic Side A placed opposite
the
&gt; occluded, benthic, inward focus of The Ninth Wave.  A brilliant pairing,
&gt; the two sets of music reflect and complement each other.
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly there is the sheer genius of musicality: Kate is at a brilliant
&gt; point in her mastery of composition. Drawing on the varied musical
&gt; traditions she has been exposed to she has distilled an entire world of
&gt; music, voice, natural sounds into a sequence of coherent works that tap
&gt; directly into the listener's emotional center.  Our hearts soar into
orbit
&gt; with Kate's voice when she sings "Hello Earth, hello earth, watching
storms
&gt; start to form over America . . ." One cannot listen to the thrum, thrum,
&gt; thrum-thrum-thrum of Cloudbusting without marching forward, so how
&gt; appropriate that this song is about the ability of a child to witness the
&gt; terrible treatment of his father by the government yet find a way to
&gt; continue his own life.  
&gt; 
&gt; Which bring us to the content of HOL/TNW.  Kate's content is vastly
&gt; ambitious, from the "Side A" exploration of relationships with others
such
&gt; as love, murder, misunderstanding and negotiation, to the Ninth Wave's
dive
&gt; into the realms of one's own soul.  No other popular album of the 80's
&gt; dared address the depth of content that Kate did.  But it is unfair to
&gt; compare other albums with HOL; they simply can't hold up.
&gt; 
&gt; Two aspects of HOL deserve more recognition: The Ninth Wave and the
&gt; "B-Sides" Kate produced to accompany the singles.  I can't think of
another
&gt; piece of music in the popular music realm as complex, unified, and
complete
&gt; as The Ninth Wave.  The Ninth Wave holds up as a remarkable
accomplishment
&gt; that has always left me wishing Kate would work on more long pieces. 
&gt; 
&gt; The "B-Sides" that accompanied the singles for HOL were gems in their own
&gt; right: The Handsome Cabin Boy was humorous, My Lagan Love was lovely a
&gt; capella, Not This Time had us all tooriyah tooriyoh-ing in time, and then
&gt; she hit us with what is possibly the most beautiful song in existence,
&gt; Under the Ivy.   As if that wasn't enough, several remarkable remixes of
&gt; the singles were made available, including the nearly seven minute
&gt; Meteorological Mix of The Big Sky which begins with an Australian
&gt; digeridoo, blows a passing kiss at the clouds of Ireland, and ends with
&gt; Native American rain chants.   
&gt; 
&gt; You almost could not remove a song, a note, a word from the entire album
&gt; and have it still hold together.  Like a poem, it is self-contained and
&gt; perfect, and the remarkable thing is that Kate has gone on to give us The
&gt; Sensual World and The Red Shoes, albums very different in scope and
&gt; objective from Hounds of Love, but ultimately informed by what Kate
learned
&gt; in making Hounds. 
&gt; 
&gt; My two cents worth . . .
&gt; 
&gt; Karen  
&gt; 
&gt; P.S.  Any chance of encouraging EMI to also make the B-sides available?
&gt; I'd still like to have a better recording of that RUTH instrumental
version.

Karen,

I love Kate's music also and count HOL among my favorite Kate albums.  For
your own good I do believe you should put down that copy of the Jim
Morrison biography you're reading.  The sooner the better.  It will rot
your brain out.  :-)

Appolic and Dianic indeed!

Where's Ray Manzerak when you need a truly pedantic lecture on the
Dionysian heroes in R'n'R?
