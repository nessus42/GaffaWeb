Dear Friends,

Back again after a gap. Sorry to all US and European readers for  late 
dispatch of the yule HOMEGROUND. But you know us, surely? Another slap 
on the wrist for us and a promise to try harder.

Some  people have picked up on our comments to EMI regarding the  odds 
and  sods  album.  I doubt if at the end of the  day  we  carried  the 
matter.  The final decision was Kate's. We responded on behalf of  our 
readers,  as  was clear from their letters and comments to us  at  the 
time  of  the  release of the original boxed set. We  don't  speak  on 
behalf  of the great world record-buying public. From  the  commercial 
point  of view there is no doubt that said odds and sods  album  would 
have  been a success (lets face it, no matter what our opinions,  we'd 
all have bought it!).

I expect other people have already posted this news - but the "Brazil" 
soundtrack has turned up on what appears to be an official release CD.

Astrology.  Kate, 30th July 1958, Bexleyheath, Kent, England. I  think 
the chart set for 12-21 pm with 3 degrees Scorpio rising seems to  fit 
best  (intuition?).  Equal  house  system  of  course.  This  has  the 
interesting  consequence of the highly significant conjunction of  the 
sun and Uranus (6 and 10 degrees Leo) in the tenth house very close to 
the midheaven (at 15 degrees Leo). It also has the moon in Aquarius in 
the 4th house, and most satisfying, Neptune rising (2 degrees Scorpio) 
with a wide conjunction to Jupiter (24 degrees Libra).

The delineation of the above is overwhelmingly convincing!

Kate's  current  hairstyle?  She  was at the Roy  Harper  gig  at  the 
Bloomsbury  theatre  in North London in early January  and  her  usual 
hairstyle seemed to be in place.

Album  news.  There  isn't any. Our bet is now on  Autumn,  but  we're 
willing to be surprised.

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
