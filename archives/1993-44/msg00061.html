Hello,

Time, as promised, for my Red Shoes review.

...So why is everyone picking on 'Why should I love you'? I think
it's a song the album really needed; a bit of happiness amongst all
the tears and sadness sprayed over the listener. 
I mean, this album is quite an extraordinary trip of emotions.
Let's go by the songs one by one, as others have done. (Maybe then
we can compare our thoughts a bit...)
I rated the songs on a scale of 10, to make things easier for you
:).
Rubberband girl: The first single in Europe, and I must say, having
bought a promo 1 day before its release, then I was surprised at
the 'B-side'-potential for this song. It reminded me of 'Burning
bridge' and 'I'm still waiting'. NOT a single, for Pete's sake! Not
Kate in her best moments, I must say. (Rating: 6)
And so is love: I truly liked this song at first hearing. I like
it, it's nicely melodic. (Rating: 8)
Eat the music: I remember hearing this song for the first time on
22. October, at Vinyl Experience while on vacation in London on the
US CD-single (which I, needless to say, bought.) It sounded so
bright, party-ish. I like the sound of the song, but those
lyrics... my God, and why did she have to use others to sing the
Chorus? Could've been better. Sorry. (Rating: 6)
Moments of Pleasure: Is it possible to declare a song Holy? Five
years ago I thought no-one, not even Kate herself, would be able to
write a song more beautiful, more emotional even, than 'This
woman's work', which is a piece of work I cherish, like my personal
#2, 'A gentleman's excuse me' by Fish. But MoP is slowly but surely
surpassing TWW. I  *L   O   V   E* this song. Anyone criticizing
this song will have to deal with me! (You're warned...) Rating: 20.
... Does anyone know who's Maureen? I did admire a girl named
Maureen once, but I doubt Kate is singing about her. It *does* give
this song a special meaning for me, though...
The song of Solomon: The textual content is a bit beyond me, but I
love it anyway. Wish she'd have used a little less 'bullshit'
though. It doesn't become her. (Rating: 8)
Lily: I would like this song more if I knew who all those people
were. (Rating: 7)
The red shoes: Hey, this is a good song! She really *finished* this
one! Titletracks of Kate are always very good - this one is no
exception (mind you, 'The dreaming' was... but that's another
story) (Rating: 9)
Top of the city: That line, 'Take me up to the top of the city...'
It sounds so clear! So airy! Like she's already standing on top of
the city! I like this song! (Rating: 7,5)
Constellation of the heart: Another choir. Hmmm.... Dunno. I might
like this song better upon hearing it more. (Rating: 6,5)
Big stripey lie: This song really has been saved by the violins. I
particularly like the outro, when all the noise has been removed.
I don't understand why everyone is so very enthusiastic about this
one. I do like it after 20 times listening to it, but it's not her
best work on the album. Not by a long shot. (Rating: 7,5)
Why should I love you: Kate showing that she can use literally
everyone and blending 'em nicely into her own music. I do like
Prince occasionally ('When doves cry' is probably one of the best
songs from that year), and here he shows that he can still play
guitar and keyboards like the best of them, though he has decided
to make yukky music on his own albums. Like I wrote above, this is
the happy song the album needed. It works for me - I don't
understand why it doesn't work for others. Prince-loathers, maybe?
Look beyond the person, please. (Rating: 8)
You're the one: How to end an album, lesson 6. Only Lionheart
didn't have a 'good' ending, leaving the listener stunned (TKI),
shattered (Breathing), scared out of his/her wits (GOOMH), totally
happy (TMF) or moved to tears (TWW). In 'You're the one' Kate shows
how it's done again. Gary Brooker is *brilliant*, Jeff Beck's
guitar sounds like it could really weep, while Kate delivers a line
with so much pain &amp; soul that again the listener is moved to tears.
Thsi song has only one flaw: it's too short. I could listen to the
lonely, deserted 'Sugar?', 'Honey?' indefinitely. The Trio is used
properly this time, like in 'Never be mine' and 'Deeper
understanding' on TSW (Yes that is a good album - don't smack it,
please!)

I think 'The red shoes' is a natural progression when seen in
context of the former 6 albums. Kate is musically still evoluating,
thought textually she sometimes seems to lose the way nowadays. I
find it quite interesting that she's writing more about herself
than on former albums - it seems. 
I don't get it - you're all picking somuch on Kate, like she's made
some horrible album. Are you fans, or what? 
To me, 'The red shoes' is fifty-five minutes of listening
enjoyment, no 'but's or 'though's attached. The crystalclear sound
of the whole, the integration of several musical styles, the voice
- which is not "constipated" at all, btw; you should listen to some
'artists' nowadays - : it all fits. Like a CD in a CD-player. And
this CD stays in mine, as far as I'm concerned.

A happy KaTe-Consumer :-)....
