Maybe it was Richard Caldwell, I can't remember, but somebody the other week 
mentioned that they were experimenting with playing Side B of the new album 
with the tracks in the order in which the lyrics appear on the UK album 
slipcover (or EMI CD foldout).

Well, whoever you are, you found the secret.  The folded sheet for the US 
Sony/Columbia CD looks to be a last-minute fudge:  the fruit in the 
background is b&amp;w, and the lyrics are scattered out of any order at all--much 
less the clear Side A/Side B structure of the album.  But on the liner for 
the 12" vinyl album, and on the folded sheet for the EMI CD (background in 
color, and much heavier stock) it is completely clear that there is a very 
formal Side A/Side B construction for this set, and that the original track 
order for Side B was:

              The Red Shoes
              Top of the City
              You're the One
              Big Stripey Lie
              Why Should I Love You?
              Constellation of the Heart

I very strongly suggest programming your CD player to play the songs in this 
sequence, making the tape for the car in this sequence, and thinking about 
the songs and the album as a whole with this sequence.

This is so clearly the artist's intention that I'm not even going to take 
time to comment on it now.  Kate let marketing people overrule her about the 
UK single ("Eat the Music" was always the single in her mind, it appears), 
and she let them have their way on the Side B tracklist too.  I can hear what 
they were telling her:  "TotC and YtO are two quiet songs back to back, and 
WSILY and CotH are two funky ones back to back; mix 'em up!"  She knew that 
the real tracklist had already gone to print, so what the hell, why fight it. 
Those of us who pay attention had already been alerted.

The album can't end with "You're the One," because then it would be lyrically 
completely disconsolate, whereas musically it is stunningly strong and 
collaborative and healing.  If you don't have the UK CD or vinyl releases to 
guide you on this question, just try this order for Side B out and see if it 
doesn't solve a lot of problems.  The core discovery:  "You're the One" is 
answered by "Big Stripey Lie."
