agough@sedona.intel.com (Andy Gough) writes, wrt HoL:

&gt;Agreed.  Amazingly consistent quality.  The only weak song is "Mother Stands
&gt;For Comfort."  

I definitely disagree. IMHO, it's a strong and chillingly powerful song.

&gt;I've read that Trio Bulgarka is supposed to be famous, but famous for what?

Singing. They were part of the Bulgarian Women's Choir (Le Mystere des voix
Bulgares) before splitting off to form Trio Bulgarka.

&gt;All's they usually do is contribute an annoying, loud, high-pitching, wailing
&gt;sound in the background.  Especially on TSW (all songs in which they appear).

Besides TSW, where have you heard them sing "background" anywhere? (Btw, I
love their voices, on Le Mystere, on their own album and on TSW.)

&gt;Serious question:  Are they famous for wailing like that?  

Actually, yes. They are world-famous for their singing. That type of
"wailing" (which is a very good word for it) is very old, an important
part of traditional Bulgarian music. I personally love how Kate
incorporates their ancient sound in her modern music.

&gt;If so, okay then, I just don't like what they do, but I can agree that they
&gt;wail with the best of 'em.  

It can sound alien, especially the way Kate uses their voices. TB's album
"The Forest Is Crying" is (so I've heard) quite hard to find now, but if
you ever see Le Mystere des voix Bulgares' first album, just called 
"Vol. 1" I believe, I highly recommend it. It's strange and beautiful,
and the Trio Bulgarka singers are on it. Hearing it may make you
understand a bit better what traditional Bulgarian music, and the 
wailing singing style, is all about and you might appreciate what they
do better. Or not...that style of music isn't eveyone's cup of tea.

&gt;I also agree they were used better on TRS.  But, I think that mainly because
&gt;they're farther in the background (lower volume) and harder to hear!

Too bad, IMHO. On TSW, a listener familiar with the TrioB knows 
automatically who it is because their voices are very distinctive.
On TRS, they could be anyone. (visions of Go West dancing in my head...)

&gt;Oh, don't forget the "You just _refuse_ to understand!" statements.  ;-)

Don't take what I said above as being meant in such a way, because it's
not.

&gt;     So perhaps KaTe's song writing is more uneven now?  

What, you're not sure? :-) Since you phrase it as a question, I'll be 
happy to answer. IMHO, no, not at all.

You live in Sedona? I *love* Sedona! (And Oak Creek Canyon and Jerome
and every other inch of 89A, the most beautiful stretch of highway in
America after 1/101 in California, Oregon &amp; Washington)

Vickie (who still has a few dozen more listens to go...:-) thanks, mjm)
