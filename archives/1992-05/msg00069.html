The following was created and performed by Steve Berlin, with the ||&gt;'s
	written by Bill Wisner:
|Geez, there is already too-long a lag between postings.  We don't need
|a reason for yet another delay.

     Huh?  I don't log in every five minutes to notice the delay.

||&gt; The second catch is that the delay between posting an article and seeing it
||&gt; show up would probably be directly related to how busy I was that day.  Sad
||&gt; to say, Love-Hounds is not at the top of my personal priority totem pole.
|Love-Hounds not the most important thing in your life? BLASPHEMPY!  You
|must be BURNED AT THE STAKE with those other CRETINS who thing KATE BUSH
|is a MERE MORTAL!  (Note for the humor-oblivious (not to mention any
|names, such as Jorn) - that was sarsasm)

     I was beginning to smile.  It almost made it.
     Why don't we all just stick name calling.  Stick it in a security
box and send them to Satan, he's the only person who needs that crap.
     If sarsasm is indeed different from sarcasm, I may need to reevaulate
my last paragraph.  ;-)

|P.S. If I WAS temporarily kick off this newgroup, could I consider
|myself to be suspended from Gaffa?

     No.
     Why don't you take your petty (and shallow, IMHO) namecalling to email?
I don't give a damn what you think Jorn is (although I'll silently disagree or
agree at will,) I doubt that anyone else cares, and the foolish name calling
is ALL WE ****ING NEED right now.
     If it makes you feel better to insult Jorn, then email should be
perfectly adequate, right?
     I hope I know what your answer is.
