&gt; what you are asking for is to make r.m.g a "true" group where a post
&gt; made to it is distributed from the poster's site rather than the 
&gt; moderator's. 

Yes, exactly.

&gt; i don't really know if this will make much of a differ-
&gt; ence in the speed of the group. 

That would depend on a lot of factors.  The difference could range
from very little to a lot depending on where a post is coming from and 
going to.  The real benefit would be improved reliability for the 
newsgroup, which is currently much less reliable than the mailing list..

&gt; but, it will in effect limit the
&gt; readership of the digest who will be without love-hounds when the
&gt; digesting software breaks - while the newsgroup readers go along on
&gt; their merry way. seems a bit unfair - especially since love-hounds/
&gt; gaffa began as a mailing list.

It has for always been more common for the newsgroup to miss posts that 
appear on the mailing list than vice versa.  In fact, I spoke 
too soon about the things working well.  It appears that several posts 
that appeared on the mailing list recently have failed to appear at any 
of my USENET sites.  

I believe that if the gateway were reworked it would be much more
fair.  It doesn't seem to me that the mailing list would be any more likely 
to lose posts than the newsgroup if moderation were removed.  Certainly it 
would be possible for the mailing list to fail completely while the newsgroup
continues to function but that's the point.

Insisting that both media must fail if one does doesn't make sense.   I 
don't think this idea would make the mailing list any less reliable than
newsgroup.  I wouldn't make the suggestion if I did since I normally 
read the mailing list and reply through the newsgroup.

Of course, ultimately it's up to Bill to decide how to handle it.
