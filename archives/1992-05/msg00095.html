&gt; [From: rhill@netlink.cts.com (Ron Hill):] This is very interesting.
&gt; I've read where she said the city was stressful and I've read where
&gt; she's said she was upset about John Lennon dying, but I've never
&gt; read where she or anyone else made the connection between the two.
&gt; Could you give us your source (if it's not confidential)?

I read this a long time ago, and my memory of the exact source is
rather vague at this point.  I think the specific mention of the
installation of a security system with a camera at the gate was from
Peter Morris in Homeground, rather than from an interview with Kate
herself.  I also think that it was in the same article that it was
mentioned that the camera was installed shortly after the murder of
John Lennon.  I don't know what Peter's source is, but I think I
recall reading about the camera in an independent source.

&gt; From:	janson@well.sf.ca.us (Mike Janson)

&gt; Today, I saw what appeared to be some kind of a KaTe bootleg.  The CD
&gt; was pressed in Italy, and was called somthing like "Kate Bush/Peter Gabriel
&gt; 1979 Live"

&gt; Does anyone know anything about this?

I don't know anything about this specific bootleg, but I am well-aware
of the concert.  It was a single performance of Kate's Tour of Life
that was a benefit for the family of one her stage crew members who
died in an accident (fell from a lighting rig) touring the tour.
Peter Gabriel and Steve Harley showed up and sung a few songs with
Kate.

&gt; From:	Scott Telford &lt;s.telford@ed.ac.uk&gt;

&gt; Much of what she said, she had said before (the story behind
&gt; "Cloudbusting", "A Deal with God" being retitled, etc) but she did
&gt; say some things I hadn't heard before: "The Morning Fog" *does*
&gt; represent the rescue of the character - although she admitted this
&gt; wasn't explicit. I suppose "The light.../Begin to bleed/Begin to
&gt; breathe..."  does sound like someone's senses returning after being
&gt; rescued from a state of sensory deprivation...

HAH!  I knew it!  Boy, there's mud on your face Drukface!  I am finally
vindicated!  Of course Kate was rescued by the submarine and anyone
who thought differently was completely deluded.  This should prove
once and for all that I am always right.
