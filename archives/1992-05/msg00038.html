In article &lt;20320.696815959@ims.alaska.edu&gt;, wisner@ims.alaska.EDU (The World Famous Bill Wisner) writes:
|&gt; Do readers really want Love-Hounds to become truly moderated, and have
|&gt; extraneous articles (for some definition of extraneous) filtered out?
|&gt; 
|&gt; I could do this.  But there are catches.
|&gt; 
|&gt; The first catch, the obvious one, is that rec.music.gaffa would no longer
|&gt; be an immediate forum.  Articles would not show up and be available for
|&gt; reading until the moderator got around to posting it.  Some would say this
|&gt; is a good thing.
|&gt;

Geez, there is already too-long a lag between postings.  We don't need
a reason for yet another delay.
 
|&gt; The second catch is that the delay between posting an article and seeing it
|&gt; show up would probably be directly related to how busy I was that day.  Sad
|&gt; to say, Love-Hounds is not at the top of my personal priority totem pole.
|&gt;

Love-Hounds not the most important thing in your life? BLASPHEMPY!  You
must be BURNED AT THE STAKE with those other CRETINS who thing KATE BUSH
is a MERE MORTAL!  (Note for the humor-oblivious (not to mention any
names, such as Jorn) - that was sarsasm)
 
|&gt; The third catch is that my definition of what articles are suitable for
|&gt; inclusion would probably be entirely arbitrary.
|&gt; 
|&gt; So, do I turn Love-Hounds into a truly moderated mailing list/newsgroup?  Or
|&gt; does discussion (such as it is) continue unhindered?  You decide.
|&gt;

I am against all forms of censorship.  There are too many great writers
lesser minds have tried to keep quiet (for some odd reason, I feel like
using James Joyce as an example).  Not that I'm calling myself a "great
writer" (If I could, I would be the next Karen Finley), I'm not talking
about ME at all - I'm talking about ALL censorship.  If someone proposed
to kick Jorn off this newsgroup, I would tell them to fuck off. (The
proposer).

WORKING EXAMPLES:

I personally don't like reading pre-HOL interviews with Kate.  People
change, and if she were asked the same questions today, she would
probably give different answers on half the non-technical questions.

However, this is, above all, a KATE BUSH FORUM, and many people like
reading these interviews.  So keep 'em coming, I say!

couldn't be you,
it was a picture of Jorn"

P.S. If I WAS temporarily kick off this newgroup, could I consider
myself to be suspended from Gaffa?
