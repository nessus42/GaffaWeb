Hi all,

    I know there have been various comments made of late about whether or not KT 
managed to get her point across in her interpration of RM. Some see it as a 
modern version of Army Dreamers (light but with a deeper message) while others 
think that she may have even missed the whole point of the song.

    Well my two cents worths says that there ISN'T anything deep to be read into 
her version of this song. The message that RM tries to get across is the one 
that Elton and Bernie put there. I don't think KT could really do much with it 
except play it in her own way (and I DO like the what she did with it)

    I feel that she approached RM as a sort of pick-me-up whilst working on 
other things like the next album (I'm being very hopeful there). The song has 
the effect of making me happy, and more importantly has the effect of making 
those who work around me happy as well. I get a fair bit of ribbing here as the 
Kate Bush Fanatic, but many of those same people have come to me and said just 
how much they enjoy the song (we here it A LOT here on the radio) and how the up 
tempo feel acts like a sort of pick me up.

    It's nice to know that the the good word is spreading....

- Graham
