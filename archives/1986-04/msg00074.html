All the fan mags I've seen for Gabriel are all old, like from a few years
back. I'll check with my fellow Gabriel junkies and see what they say -
the mags are not very regular, although with the release of _Good_ they may
get back on track. Even the old ones carried little real info; they could
never get in touch with Gabriel or anyone from Genesis, so they resorted
to doing things like a line-by-line analysis of "Supper's Ready" and such.
The only interview I ever saw was disgustingly short, done by telephone, and
consisted of "Gee, Mr. Gabriel, I just think you're the greatest! etc etc".
Hell, my call to Gabriel had more info! In fact, here it is, from about three
or so years ago... _Security_ had just come out, "Shock the Monkey" was every-
where, and he had just played Boston (what a cool show)...

PG:	Hello.
JT:	Wow! I got through! I've been trying all night with no luck. I didn't
	think I'd get through.
PG:	Well, you have done.
JT:	I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?
PG:	Go ahead.
JT:	Ok. Most people don't search for import records, since most "normal"
	record stores don't carry them. Your import albums are in German, at
	least from PG3 on. Any reason for this?
PG:	Yes... after the first two albums, I decided that I wanted to play
	around with remixing the music. Rather than release 12" singles, which
	I normally don't do, I decided to do it on the imports. The European
	audiences take better to the slightly odd mixes.
JT:	I've had some Germans listen to PG3 and PG4 in German. They have told
	me that your pronunciation is horrible. Did you ever study German, and
	why did you not just remix and keep the english?
PG:	Well, as a schoolboy I studied German, but I was never very good at it.
	When I decided to remix the foriegn albums, I decided to be nice to the
	audience and give it to them in their own language. We only had the
	money for one language, so I decided on German, since it was easiest.
JT:	Why no album titles, except for _Security_?
PG:	I couldn't think of any. Geffen slapped "Security" on the latest. I
	suppose if you wanted to, you could refer to them as "Solsbury Hill",
	"D.I.Y.", and "Games Without Frontiers", since those seem to be the
	most popular peices from each.
JT:	Have you ever thought of doing "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway" as a
	film, in the same manner as "The Wall"?
PG:	When I get the money, I will. I've talked with Alejandro Joderofsky,
	who directed "The Red Baloon", about being the director. But it's still
	a long way off.
JT:	Who would play Rael?
PG:	I would, of course! [laugh] I don't know, really.
JT:	What do you think of bootlegs?
PG:	I like brown leather, calf high. [laugh] Bootlegs? As long as there's
	nothing on one that I absolutely hate, I don't mind. In fact, I like
	the 1982 reunion concert bootleg because it was a good concert and we
	hadn't set up for recording.

At this point, he had to go, so that was it. This took place a half-hour
after he was on a radio talk-show nationwide. I had tried calling 25
minutes or so after the show was over, and got him. As it turns out, I asked
some questions he had been asked already, but he was nice enough to answer
'em anyway. I've also since lost the tape I made of the interview, which
leaves only the permanently embedded stuff in my mind...

				"Caught the chaos in the market square
				 I don't know what, I don't know why,
				 but something's wrong down there!
				 Their bodies twisting and turning
				 In a thousand ways, their eyes are
				 Rolling round and round to a different gaze"
