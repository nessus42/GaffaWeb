....this is my first letter and it's just stuff.......Does anyone know
anything about a new The The album? I heard a song on WFNX the other day 
that was said by the DJ to be from their new album. Unfortuneately, no 
title was mentioned and I haven't been able to find a new album anywhere.....

.....more sid stuff (does he never die?)......has anyone read "And I Don't
Want to Live This Life" by Deborah Spungen (you guessed it -- Nancy's mom)
If you haven't, you should check it out. It's, uh, interesting to say the
least......not completely trash, but almost. The Chicago Sun Times called
it "An American nightmare". It's basically a biography of Nancy and how she
was always troubled from the day she was born................

.....Does anyone know anything about The Pet Shop Boys and/or Boys Don't Cry?
I have the "I Wanna Be a Cowboy" 12" by  Boys Don't Cry. Is this all they've
ever done? I also have the 12" by The Pet Shop Boys with "West End Girls"
and "A Man Could Get Arrested" on the b side and the dance mix of "West End
Girls" on the a side. Do they have anythig else floating about?
That song gets my vote for most depressing lyric (the music isn't too bad"
          "Some days you're better off dead,
           there's a gun in your hand and it's
           pointing to your head.
           You think you're mad, just too unstable,
           kicking in chairs and knocking down tables"
                             -- The Pet Shop Boys, "West End Girls"

My favorite weird movies are "A Boy and His Dog" (who wrote the short
story that that was adapted from?) "Dark Star" and "Attack of the Killer
Tomatoes".          

"I Need Lunch" -- the Dead Boys.......lunch and record shopping in Harvard
square and all points beyond sounds good to me on wednesday......
anytime........
                --- Lisa
