&gt;I saw, at my local record store, a 12" Mini-Album by Kate Bush.  It's
&gt;called "Kate Bush on Stage" and it's on Harvest records.  

A random observation:
I like some of the versions of songs on the EP/mini-album/whatever-it-is
better than the versions that appear on the albums on which they were
originally released.  I like the different chorus on "James and the
Cold Gun", and I like the different piano arrangement on "Don't Push Your 
Foot on the Heartbrake".  Agreements?  Disagreements?  Get well cards?
Question:
Is this recording from Kate Bush Live at the Hammersmith (or whatever...
Hammer-something, at any rate...like the video?) Did I ask you this
already, Doug?

--------------------------
Recent convert Joe writes:
&gt;1 - Picked up "The Dreaming". Kate Bush is the most extremely wicked
&gt;pissah awesome artist I've ever heard.

And Doug says:
&gt;Hey, it's great to see another convert to the One True Faith!

And he's obviously from Boston or thereabouts.  Wicked awesome.
 
--------------------------
Doug at his sarcastic best:
&gt;And about this erotic undercurrent that's always been there...  there
&gt;are some things that have been puzzling me for a while.  Like in
&gt;"L'Amour Looks Something Like You" Kate sings at the end "I find I'm
&gt;living in that evening with that feeling of sticky love inside".  What
&gt;is this feeling of sticky love inside?  She's not talking about
&gt;*seamen* is she?  Gosh.  Is the feeling of old seamen inside you
&gt;something that is fun to remember?  Perhaps some of the women on the
&gt;list would like to elaborate.

No, I don't care to elaborate, but I'd like to correct your spelling:
semen.  Seaman is part of the punch line to the joke: What's the
difference between a JAP and the Bermuda Triangle?  (A: The Bermuda
Triangle swallows seamen!) (And no, I didn't cross-post to net.jokes.)
