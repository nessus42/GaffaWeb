Issue 22 of "HOMEGROUND -- The International KATE BUSH Fanzine" has
just arrived in my mailbox, and they've gone glossy (to compete with
"Under The Ivy", I suppose).  The late-breaking Kate news is:

	-- Kate has been working with Peter Gabriel on his new album.
	   There will be a new duet (their version of "Another Day"
	   has never appeared on a non-bootleg album), and it is planned
	   that it will be released as a single.

	-- Kate has shelved the "Ninth Wave" film, and has decided to
	   instead work on her next album after finishing her current
	   projects.

	-- Three books of photographs of Kate taken by John Bush are
	   due for publication within the next few months.  These are
	   of Kate as a child, a teenager, and as a famous person,
	   and will contain 'biographical' captions.

	-- Kate has been nominated for two of the prestigious
	   "Novello" awards for songwriters.  The nominations are Best
	   Song for RUTH and Best Lyric for "Cloudbusting".

	-- The next single will be "The Big Sky".  Kate will be
	   shooting the video soon and the single is scheduled for
	   release at the end of May or the beginning of June.

The "Hounds of Love" album is still rising back up the British
Billboard album chart and is currently at number 6.  The HoL single,
however, seems to have peaked at 18.  It is now 24.  In the U.S.,
unfortunately, the album is falling rapidly down the chart and is
currently at 130-something (it should be noted that even this is
higher than any previous album of hers peaked).  The HoL single is
nowhere to be seen.  Better get yours now, before they become a
collector's item.

			 Makes no difference who you are"
