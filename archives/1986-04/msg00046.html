Sounds like you got the same flyer they were handing out at the concert
Monday night, Doug.

Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyptians / Yo @ I-Beam, SF, March 17

EX-cellent show, tho I was too buzzed at the beginning to fully appreciate
it at that point.  Highlights: definitely the between-song patter
("My dad in the 70's had, you know, one of those devices with the arm that
swings back and forth on his desk and it kept hitting him." "This next song is
about a woman having a party whose husband upstairs has sewed himself up into
a, um, piece of black velvet, rather like a grub...")  It occurred
to me that he would probably be a megastar in the world of _Brazil_.
And "Uncorrected Personality Traits" also an apex.  Good fun all around,
like when one of the cymbals fell over (when Andy
Metcalfe was on drums) and the stagehand fumbled to put it back in place,
having to stand stock still every 5 seconds or so so Andy could hit it.

Meat Puppets / Angst @ Berkeley Square, Berkeley, March 18

I had no idea I was even going to go to this until I came home
at 10 last night, about 1/2 hr. before the Puppets came on.
So we missed the openers.  1st song:  "Up On the Sun", then from the
audience:

Asshole:  "Where's D. Boon?"
Kirkwood:  "He's dead, man."

Same covers as mentioned earlier:  "Rock and Roll", "Good Golly Miss Molly",
"Not Fade Away".  Not familiar with their songs enough to go into
detail on those, but most of the KALX sorta faves.
Robert (Barrington social director) figured Kirkwood was probably
a Jimmy Page fanatic from his on-stage moves.
