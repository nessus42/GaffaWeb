&gt;I've figured this whole Tori Amos thing out.  People have been wondering
&gt;just what it is that has caused such the unbelievable buzz about her and
&gt;_Little Earthquakes_, and the other evening the solution came to me.
&gt;
&gt;Tori's a witch.  She has placed a spell in the music of her album that makes
&gt;it almost completely impossible for one to stop listening to it once one
&gt;has begun.  Everybody I've talked to who has acquired this album has agreed
&gt;that they haven't been able to stop listening to it since they got it, and
&gt;they're not tiring of it at all.  They, myself included, can't really figure
&gt;out why they like it, if they're sure they like it at all.  But the fact
&gt;remains that I myself have listened to it at least 30 times in the two weeks
&gt;since I got it, including four straight times through last Thursday afternoon,
&gt;and when it's not on it's going through my head and I wait in anticipation
&gt;until I can get home and put it in the player.  Similar symptoms have been
&gt;reported across the globe.

    Gee, I'm glad it's not just me! I come to work, put her CD on, and leave it 
going ALL day. I've got my sister out of bed at 12:30am to play Tori's music at 
her, I've generally hassled to death other folk from around the office to let 
them know about this new talent and I haven't been able to figure out why it has 
caught my imagination so greatly.

    Add to that the normal amount of time I MUST spend every day lissening to KT 
and other new bits of music and I'm begining to run out of time to sleep!!

    Hey lifes fun at the moment...

- Graham
