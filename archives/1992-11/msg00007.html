Re: Kate Bush songs to play at a funeral....

Who thought up this thread?   Not exactly a subject that I would call a barrel 
of laughs...

Well, if nothing else, this thread gives me the opportunity to share with other
KaTe fans a story of a funeral where KaTe's music really was played.

When my sister, Carol, died last September at the age of 24, my parents and I
were asked by the priest what pieces of music we wanted played at the funeral.
My immediate reaction was to say "yes, I think that I know a very suitable 
song...."

And so it was that _This Woman's Work_ was played at the end of the service,
during the part where all the mourners filed past the coffin, putting flowers 
on top.    

It had always been a very touching song for me, being both very sad, and yet
also very joyous and hopeful.   In addition, the title seemed to symbolise
the strong stand that my sister took on many issues, and the passion that
accompanied her advocacy in such areas as lesbian visibility and disabled 
rights.  The song never meant more to me than it did when we played it that
day.   Ever since then, however, the song has seemed almost blank and 
devoid of meaning on the few occasions that I have decided to listen to it.    

A few months ago, someone on rec.music.gaffa discussed the lyrics to the song 
_The Kick Inside_, a song that I had not previously paid much attention to.  
I'm glad that they did bring it up, because within it I found a quote that 
touched me deeply:

	'Your sister I was born,
 	 You must lose me like an arrow shot into the killer storm'

Well, thanks for this opportunity to share.
