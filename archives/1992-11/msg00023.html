        Thanks to Andrew for his touching story about _The_Kick_Inside_.  
The interesting thing about the line:

Your sister I was born, 
you must lose me like an arrow, 
Shot into the killer storm. 

        Is that it seems to point the way to the _Hounds_of_Love_ album, 
with the emphasis on archery in the _Running_Up_That_Hill_ videos and 
single, and the storm imagery on _The_Ninth_Wave_.  Another POSSIBLE 
influence was mentioned when she was talked about Lindsay Kemp's dance 
classes: 

        He taught me that you can express with your body - and when your 
body is awake so is your mind.  He'd put you into emotional situations, some 
of them very heavy.  Like he'd say, "right, you're all going to become 
sailors drowning and there are waves curling up around you."  And everyone 
would just start screaming.     Or maybe he'd turn you into a little piece 
of flame...  (1978, NME)
        

        Robert Martin asks about _The_Sensual_World_ album being called 
"controversial in the monthly FAQ.  It's "controversial" mainly in a 
"quality" sense.  Some fans love it, but others feel that it isn't up to her 
past work.  _Reaching_Out_ is probably the least liked song, especially 
among those who don't like the album in general.  _This_Woman's_Work_ 
appears to be the most liked song on the album. 
        He also asked why he has never seen TWW.  If you mean the box set, 
you have to look around as it's imported.  If you mean the video, VH-1 used 
to play it quite a bit, and it is on the video you can buy in stores. 
        BKTMM is from a crummy (in my opinion) Nicholas Roeg movie called 
_Castaway_.  The only interesting thing about it is that it stars Amanda 
Donohue, who now plays TC on LA Law.  Also, the original version of the song 
is much better then the version on _Aspects_of_the_Sensual_World_ and TWW.  
As far as _Ken_ that's from a British television comedy called GLC, which is 
about Ken Livingston, a socialist leader in Britain from the early 80s.
