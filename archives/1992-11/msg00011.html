        Thanks to everyone for their massive responses about "Brazil".  I'll 
have to try to rent it.  Is there an "imported" version that has the 
original _British_ version, as opposed to the American Video version, as 
apposed to the American TV version?  

        A friend of mine at work, who I call the "Hostile Penticostile" due 
to his obnoxious "preaching" at work, told me today about how his brother 
and another friend are lightweight Kate Bush fans.  His brother apparently 
doesn't shower very much and his other friend also isn't so great.  Then he 
asked me why I'm a Kate fan, since you're judged by the company you keep.  
Unfortunately I was a little sick today and couldn't get up the energy or 
interest to defend against his bizzarre opinions.

        A couple of my FTPmail requests have shown up here.  "We are sorry 
for the inconvience."

        I've been reading messages from about two years ago in order to make 
my next book, Deeper Understanding, and I've noticed that someone mentioned 
that there were some Homeopaths on board?  Are there still?  If so please 
leave me mail.  Have you ever noticed about how _Reaching_Out_ seems to 
relate to the Homeopathic concept of how the substence that the rememdies 
are drawn from seems to be related to what the person who fits that remedy 
is like?

        If a Kate Bush fan fought "Underdog woman", who would win? 

        Is it just me, or are the songs on the Taco Bell comercials the 
worst in the world (aside from the Little Richard one).
