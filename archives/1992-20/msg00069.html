        Here's IEDs transcription along with some info from the KBC 
newsletter. 
 


                     Watching You Without Me
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 ("What's that?")                            &lt;This is a snatch of 
conversation
 ("It's four, _five_, six, seven...")         between musicians on the 
track.&gt;

      You can't hear me.
      You can't hear me.
      You can't hear what I'm saying.
      You can't hear what I'm saying to you.

 You watch the clock
 Move the slow hand.
 I should have been home
 Hours ago,
 But I'm not here.
 But I'm not here.

      You can't hear me.
      You can't hear me.
      You can't feel me
      Here in the room with you now.
      You can't hear what I'm saying.
      You don't hear what I'm saying, do you?

 Can't let you know
 What's been happening.
 There's a ghost in our home,
 Just watching you without me.
 I'm not here.
      ("You don't hear me.")                 &lt;This line heard backwards.&gt;
 But I'm not here.
 (You can't hear me.)
 But I'm not here.
 (You don't hear what I'm saying.)

      ...___...___...___...___...            &lt;Morse Code "SOS" signal&gt;

 "Don't ignore, don't ignore me,
Let me in and don't be long.                 &lt;The main "secret message", 
a
 "Don't ignore, don't ignore me,              strangely masked 
multi-track
Let me in and don't be long.                  vocal bridge; not 
backwards.*&gt;
 "Don't ignore, don't ignore me,
Let me in and don't be long."

           "We see you here."
           "We see you here."
           "We see you here."                 &lt;This section is heard 
backwards,
           "We see you here."                  but also sounds like real 
words
           "We see you here."                  ("We receive", or "We 
recede",
           "We see you here."                  or "Really see") when 
played
           "We see you here."                  forwards.&gt;
           "We see you here."

      You don't hear me come in.
 "Help me, baby! Help me, baby! Talk to me! Listen to me,
  listen to me! Talk to me! Help--"**
      ("You can't hear me.")                  &lt;This line is heard 
backwards.&gt;
 "Listen, baby! Listen to me, baby! Help me, help me, baby!
  Talk to me! Talk to me! Please, baby, talk to me!"
      ("You can't hear me.")                  &lt;This line is heard 
backwards.&gt;
      You won't hear me leaving.


&lt;*--"Don't ignore, don't ignore me...":
    This "mystery message" immediately follows the Morse code "S.O.S."
    signal. The subject of a years-long Kate Bush Club competition, it 
was
    not officially explained until late in 1989. The clues were: it is 
one
    sentence, twelve words long, and it begins with the word "Don't". 
Many
    fans considered it backwards, getting solutions which sounded a bit 
like:
    "Zwoh-nikh-noh, zwoh-nikh-noh nee, et-nee nong-widz-aw nee noy."
    The translation in the lyrics above is the official one, but there 
may
    very likely be an additional, _backwards_-directional message in this
    space which remains undeciphered.&gt;

&lt;**--"Listen to me, baby...", etc.: The words in this
    passage, and in one which follows later in the song are broken
    up--fractured--by some sound-treatment process known only to Kate.
    Similar to passages from _Waking_the_Witch_, these
    lines seem to contain different words when played
    backwards. Respectively, these are: "I was here before, you talked to 
me,
    you said that you didn't think it was too late to help me...";
    and "Talk to me, listen to me, talk to me, talk to me,
    baby..." These words apparently were recorded within the
    momentary gaps which break up the forward-directional recording.&gt;

&gt;From The Kate Bush Club Newsletter:

We have decided to put you out of your misery regarding the
"Watching You Without Me" competition.  Many attempts were
getting further and further away from the answer; things like
"Don't need much, don't need money, believe life goes on and
on" and "Don't seek far don't seek for me, let me learn widowly
love."  Others made us think some of you were on another
planet; "Don't somnie morn somnie mornings then mean life
goes on and on" and "Don't run on those Blarney mats, in own
keen-ness slumps keen-ness."  There were quite a few who
thought the word dawn was in there somewhere "Don't be sad
don't be lonely, let me see the coming dawn" and "Don't need
more dawn each morning, help me that was long enough."  In
the last few months we've received many suggestions which
have trhe first 8 words right:--"Don't ignore don't ignore me let
me in"...  But nobody got the last 4 words right--the
suggestions included ,"I'm the dawning of"/"on the dawning
hour"/"at the dawning hour"/"I must only knock"/"I was
holding on."  But the correct answer is ... DON'T IGNORE
DON'T IGNORE ME, LET ME IN AND DON'T BE LONG.
