<PRE>
On the plus side, Gaffaweb had a lot going for it:  Some of the
most rabid Lovehounds all working on it.

On the minus side, Gaffaweb had a huge handicap going in to it:
Some of the most rabid Lovehounds working on it.  I mean, these
are people who can't discuss the color of the sky without having a
huge flame war ("Everyone knows it's blue!"  "Actually, it's Cyan."
"I'd say it's more baby blue, which is nothing like blue."  "That cloud
looks like snow."  "No it doesn't!")

But all in all, they met the goal they set out for:  Creating the Ultimate
Kate Bush website, and then some.

Any ONE of these features would make this a must-see site, and they
give us almost a dozen!

First there's the FAQ.  While it has always been a group effort, extra
congratulations have to go out for Vickie here.  Most HTML FAQs I've
seen are all the same - links at the top which link to where in the FAQ the
question is answered, and the only off-site links go to places specifically
mentioned in the FAQ.  Vickie did those things, of course, but added an
extra great bonus of putting little random (but appropriate) links everywhere
hidden in the FAQ.  Try it!

Next, comes a section about Early Kate (the demo tapes, and everything
leading up to The Kick Inside).  I've only briefly scanned this section, but
I do intend to go back soon - it does look fascinating!

Then comes a couple of sections which truly makes this a Lovehounds/
rec.music.gaffa Web site:  A couple of "Best of Lovehounds" sections
compiled by Wieland Willker.  Last year he did a remarkable effort similar
to this - here, it's even more comprehensive and nicely HTML-ized.

Next up is The Garden - a copy of the version HTMLized by Woj previously.
One can not consider themself a true KateFan(tm) without studying IED's
obsessive thesis here.

After that is a a videography noting every single appearance Kate has done
anywhere on TV.  If that doesn't sound interesting, obviously you don't know
KateFan(tm) Obsessive Attention to Detail.

Then comes a collection of interviews, articles, and reviews.  That should
be self-explanitory.

The next section is my personal favorite.  I mean, the FAQ and the Garden
are definate must-see stops if you've never seen them, but I have so that
takes some of the novelty away.  This section is a wonderful dictionary
compiled by Richard Bensam.  A search engine is promised for it, but even
without it you WILL spend hours here, and enjoy every minute of it.

Every section has a cute little name (for example, the above-mentioned
dictionary is called "Them Heavy People").  The next section is one that
lives up to it's name:  "Wow!"  - dozens and dozens of wonderful pictures
of Kate.  As of this writing, there's no order to them, but you will not mind
flipping through page after page after page of these.

Finally comes a Discography, which is still pretty much under construction
and looks mostly taken from the FAQ anyway.  However, it's not really a bug;
it's just not a feature (yet).

Almost any one of the above sections I would have given at least an 8 or 9
out of 10 to.  The content is amazing, the pages are simple yet very well 
laid-out, it loads nice and fast.  Combine all these elements, and only one
synopsis is possible:  This is not only the best Kate site on the Web - it's 
one of best sites on the Web PERIOD.  A+ all around, folks.  Not only 
10-out-of-10:  This site goes to 11!
