Any opinions?

While I'm here I might as well rate the albums I have listened to a lot:

 1) Lionheart (CD)
 2) The Red Shoes (CD)
 3) The Sensual World (Cassette)

And here is the order I've been introduced to Kate. This started about a 
year or two ago, I think.

 - Hammersmith (Video) - I bought this on a lark. I think I had heard of Kate 
Bush, but I knew absolutely nothing about her. I fell in love with her music 
and I was fascinated by her dancing and staging and costumes. I used to 
really like Pat Benetar's cover of "Wuthering Heights", but Kate does it 
beautifully. This video got me hooked. I found that my wife wasn't too fond 
of her "screechy" voice.

 - Lionheart (CD). This is the first album I got and I still love it. 
(Needless to say, Kate really displays her "screechy" voice here and my wife 
really doesn't like her now!) This album has my favorite "threefer" (three 
songs in a row): In The Warm Room, Kashka From Baghdad, and Coffee 
Homeground. But all the other songs on this album are really great. I know 
this album has appeared low on many people's list, but for me it is the best 
of the albums I have.

 - The Sensual World (Cassette). I bought this after being so affected by 
Lionheart and didn't listen to it much. It wasn't until later, after I 
realized I am a Katefan, after The Red Shoes, that I started listening to 
this seriously. And I really like it. In fact, I liked it so much I bought 
the videos. "Love and Anger", "This Woman's Work", and "The Sensual World" 
are among my favorite tracks.

 - The Red Shoes "Pre-Release" (CD). I'm not sure what to call this. It came 
out before TRS, kind of as a teaser. It had "Eat the Music", "ETM extended 
mix", "Big Stripey Lie", and "Candle in the Wind". When I first heard it, I 
didn't particulary like BSL and unfortunately it seems to be very prevalent 
on TRS singles.

 - The Red Shoes (CD). "Lily" and "The Red Shoes" are at the top of my list 
for all-time favorite songs. Most of the songs are pretty good. RBG I have 
grown to like a lot. A few songs leave me untouched (so far). In fact, this 
album has my least favorite "threefer": "Top of the City", "Constellation of 
the Heart", and "Big Stripey Lie" (I still don't have much affection for 
that song).

 - The Sensual World (Video). My three favorite songs from TSW on one video. 
Cool. I was a little disappointed in the "Love and Anger" video when it 
changed to a band video.

 - The Single File (Video). Wow. This gave me an introduction to a lot of 
Kate's songs that I hadn't yet heard. I enjoyed them a lot, but I don't play 
the video much so I haven't gotten a chance to listen to them very much. :-&lt;

 - Various TRS Singles. All of which seem to have "Big Stripey Lie" on them!

 - The Dreaming (borrowed). I listened to this for two weeks straight at 
work. I liked it, but since I don't have it and can't keep listening I don't 
remember much. I did particularly like "Houdini" and
"Night Of The Swallow".

 - The Kick Inside (CD). I bought this a couple of months ago and I am a 
little ashamed to say I haven't listened to it much yet. I really have to 
copy it to tape so I can listen in the car and at work.

Well, there you go. A rather verbose delurk... I've been reading love-hounds 
for many months and I really appreciate reading all this stuff.

P.S. - I'm listening to TRS as I write this and maybe I do like "Big Stripey 
Lie"... Go figure.
