Andrea writes (in rdt):

&gt;Wow. All i have to say is WOW! I saw Tori tonight at Pick Staigar in
&gt;Evanston. She was amazing. I've heard people say how good she was, but I
&gt;didn't expect _this_. WOW.

I *knew* you'd like it :).  I'm so glad you were there, and I'm sorry
we didn't meet.

Yep, we were able to go.  We went there without tickets, but there were
people outside the venue selling tickets.  We paid $4.00 over the face
value, which wasn't bad.  We ended up in the balcony though.  We could
have gone to the second show if we'd had the money, but rent and phone
bill wiped up out :-(.  I can't complain...well...missing "Wrapped Around
Your Finger" *and* "Yes, Anastasia"...maybe I can, but not *too* loudly,
because I would have been *really* depressed if we'd missed both shows.


&gt;No Icicle, Teen Spirit. Hmm. I think MAAG kinda drained her.

It is interesting how she seems to have dropped "American Pie/Smells"
from her set list.  I wonder if it's permanent.

One scary moment happened when someone jumped up on stage and ran toward
her when she came back for her 1st encore.  He was immediately stopped
by someone (was it her tour manager Joel? We were too far away to see
and the lights were down) and led away.  It all happened so quickly I
almost thought I imagined it.  
 
&gt;Oh- When I went to find our seats there were two people sitting in them.
&gt;Later on I saw them hanging out with a guy with a Gaffa shirt. I just
&gt;wanted to know if they were on rdt.

Hmm, my guy Chris was wearing a "Suspended in rec.music.gaffa" shirt,
with a picture of the cover of _The Dreaming_ on the front.  Big guy,
long long hair and glasses?  If it wasn't him you saw, I wonder who
else was wearing such a shirt.  We didn't meet anybody else from
the net at the show, so the people he was talking to weren't rdt'ers.

&gt;Tori was wonderful. If you have ANY doubts about seeing her live, it
&gt;doesn't matter. Do it.

Absolutely agreed!


Ectophiles: Continuing the tradition, I gave Tori's tour manager a copy
of Building The Colossus.  He remembered me as  "Tori's Happy connection" :) 
Thank goodness it's the end of the tour (well, not really, of course)
because I've run out of albums to give her :)
