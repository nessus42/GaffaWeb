 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: Was Freud right about dreams being wish-fulfillment fantasies!

     IED is further gone than he realized. The last two mornings he was
awakened much earlier than is normal for him--thereby apparently having
his REM sleep interrupted. Normally IED doesn't retain any memory of
his dreams, but these special circumstances opened his eyes (ha).
     On the first morning he had been dreaming of a magical library.
IED asked the reference librarian if they carried any of the works
of Kate Bush, and lo and behold, she led me to a whole shelf of file-
boxes. In these boxes were dozens of records, CDs and photographs, and
among the records were a large number of Kate's early home-recordings.
     Then IED woke up. The day was a total loss.
     Then this morning he dreamt that he was at a record swapmeet. Just
as he was about to leave he saw another visitor with a new Kate bootleg
compact disk in his hand. It looked almost like the bootleg-CD of
the _Hammersmith_ concert, but on closer examination its cover-photo
was different. IED asked if he could inspect it, and the visitor
grudgingly obliged. Lo and behold, what should the CD's track-listing
include, but at least twenty hitherto-unknown early demo-recordings
by Kate--including one entry marked "Songs (recorded between ages 5
and 8)".
     Then IED woke up. The day is going to be a total loss.
