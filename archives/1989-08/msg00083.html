[List of ZTT possesions]
&gt; 
&gt; I know that AON has done a large set of remixes.  But
&gt; beyond remixes of the above mentioned, does anyone know
&gt; of other releases from ZTT (preferably on CD)?  Also, I
&gt; am interested in finding other musics in this vein as 
&gt; well.  I have heard some Yello that I liked.  What else
&gt; is out there?  Danceable or not.  Where else has Trevor
&gt; Horn had his hands?  Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; George

  Hmm, as my memory allows, the Trevor Horn story picks up at the
Buggles (check out 'The Age of Plastic', and 'Adventures in Modern
Recording') and Yes (Drama). Then ZTT, Art of Noise, Frankie goes to
Hollywood, and Propaganda being the groups of real interest. You may
like to follow up with Act, but I seem to remember most of their stuff
is produced by Steve Lipson (actually he produced a lot of the other
stuff too, Trevor Horn just came down and said 'nice, but do it this
way' a few times until he was happy).

  Collecting every ZTT release is like trying to swim up a waterfall.
There is just so much stuff, a lot of which is impossible to find
unless you follow Record Collector on it's day of release, or trek
around the country (preferably the U.K.) following record fairs.
You'll also need a hefty bank balance.

  Also, ZTT doesn't imply quality. I got burned on Das Psycho Rangers,
not what I wanted at all. Also, some of the AoN stuff gets pretty,
well strange (Close Up, and Close Up (Hop) are examples of this).
Which reminds me, if you find a 12" of Close Up (Close to the edit
remix), check the record label. They released four different 12"s
inside the same sleeve.

  Outside of ZTT (which is virtually defunct now, anyway), production
jobs I'm aware of, are two tracks on the Pet Shop Boys, Introspective
(including the brilliant 'Left to my own Devices'), and the new Simple
Minds album.
 
  As far as CDs go, then you're going to be hard pushed to get many
more. Over the ZTT albums Daft, A Secret Wish, Wishfull Thinking,
Welcome to the Pleasure Dome, and possibly Liverpool, you're looking
at CDsingles. For the Art of Noise, the only ZTT CDsingles I know of,
are the Moments in love CDsingle, and the Japanese (and possibly
German) Close Up. Propaganda have P-Machinery (the Polish 12") and
possibly the first Dr Mabuse 12" on import CDs, and FGTH have (to my
knowledge) CDsingles for Relax and 2Tribes (import), Rage Hard,
Warriors, and Wildlife (possibly) released in the UK. Others are
possible. There is a complete ZTT discography wandering about
somewhere, but my mail to the person who updates it keeps hitting
black holes (are you reading this Lazlo Nibble?).

Phil
