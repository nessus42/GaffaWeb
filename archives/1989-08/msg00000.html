 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick
 Subject: By request, KT fanzine information

   Just a quick word re Joe Zitt's remarks about Eno et al. "preceding"
Kate in various ways. IED conceded that this sort of thing could only
ever be gauged by degrees. Julian's point about Wagner "preceding" her
is just as true as Joe's that Eno did. And just as vague, as well.
In other words, they all did different things (--and what Kate did, of
course, is much better!).
     Now, here is the KT fanzine information that Steve W. (IED
believes) requested, among others. Please, people, if you think
you may some day want to consult the following, SAVE it, so it
won't have to be posted again in L-Hs in another two months.

                     _Kate_Bush_Fanzines_Address_List_

     These were the addresses and subscription rates (air mail, one year
to the U.S.) as of the last issues of the _Kate_Bush_Club_Newsletter_
(number 22) and _Homeground_ (number 34) plus the names and addresses of
all the other Bush-related fanzines that I know of--making a total of
_seventeen._

 1. _The_Kate_Bush_Club_

      P.O. Box 120
      Welling
      Kent DA16 3DS
      ENGLAND
       Airmail subscription to U.S., one year: 10 Pounds, 50 Pence.
(Surface mail subscription, one year:
6 Pounds. Warning: surface mail can take up to two months or even
longer. Publication, and as a result all renewal fees as well,
were suspended as of October 1988, pending the release of Kate's
sixth studio album. Apparently a brief issue has recently been
printed (as of May 1989), though it reportedly contains little of
real interest to fans, since there is no new word on KBVI.

 2. _Homeground_

 Peter and Krystyna FitzGerald-Morris and Dave Cross, editors
 Sharon May, Secretary
 P.O. Box 176
 Orpington
 Kent BR5 3NA
 ENGLAND
  Airmail subscription to U.S., one year: 10 Pounds, 30 Pence.

     Note: The Kate Bush Club asks for payment in U.K. (Sterling) money.
They prefer the money in the form of an International Sterling
draft, but my experience with those is that they can now cost as much
as twenty dollars extra, on top of the already extremely high conversion
rate. My recommendation is that payment be made in U.K. cash, which you
can get at airports, or at some banks and currency exchange offices.
The commission is not much, and if your envelope is carefully sealed
and can't be seen through, it'll stand a pretty good chance of getting
there. U.S. dollars are frowned on by the KBC, but they might work if you are
very careful to pay at the current exchange rate _plus_ at _least_ seven
and a half percent extra to cover conversion costs. (As you know,
the Dollar is not worth much these days.) _Homeground_ will accept U.S.
currency, but only at the going rate plus exactly 7 1/2 percent.
     It should be added that the KBC Newsletter is published only
very irregularly, and very rarely, as well. The last issue appeared in
late January, 1987, and it was the first issue in more than ten months.
And in 1983, members had to wait an entire year and then some between
_Newsletters_. In October 1988 publication was suspended until news
about the new album could be prepared. Latest word is that a new issue
is now out, but it reportedly contains little new information. In other
words, the Club is for _real_ fans--the kind who can
tolerate waiting months and months at a time for
word from Kate. The advantage is that the KBC publishes the only
authorised news and information about/by Kate. All the other
fanzines--and there are a lot of them--are unofficial and receive no
direct input from the Bush family.
     By contrast, _Homeground_ puts out at least four issues every year,
plus a little update flier when there is some important news development.
_Homeground_ is  still a more or less homemade, black-and-white affair,
but it's now quite professionally printed, is
always interesting and has become an indispensible record of KT fandom.
     The _Kate_Bush_Club_Newsletter_, on the other
hand, is very luxurious but quite brief. It has a good deal of
very fine and exclusive photography, most of it now in spectacular colour,
much of it the work of Kate's brother John Carder Bush. The _Newsletter_
usually features either an introductory letter,
article or interview by/with Kate; articles by John and/or Paddy,
Kate's two brothers; an occasional note from Del Palmer; a Pen Pals
page and a Swaps page; Kate's own comic strip about the misadventures of
her cats, Zoodle and Pyewacket (this was my favourite section, now sadly
suspended, perhaps due to the sad news of Zoo's death; with luck perhaps
a new strip featuring the new kittens will appear in future issues?);
a puzzle/competitions page; news bits (usually out-of-date by the time they
reach subscribers); and one-off articles, art and/or comic strips by fans.
     For its part, _Homeground_ features an
exhaustive record of press, radio and television coverage
of Kate during the quarter preceding each issue, called _Medialogue_;
an immensely helpful ongoing series of facts, dates and biographical
information from the co-editor Peter FitzGerald-Morris, called _Five_
_Years_Ago_; essays on Kate's music and related (and sometimes unrelated)
matters, by fans and the editors; comic strips; poetry; and a spot for personal
notices. _Homeground_, unlike the _Newsletter_, publishes readers'
comments very frequently.
