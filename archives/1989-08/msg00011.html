     Here's a discography of The Wolfgang Press's work.  As with the
biography, please reply to me if you see any errors or omissions.  I would
like to keep this up to date, and accurate.  Thanks, and enjoy.

Cheers,

WHEEL IN THE ROSES      1980 4AD        Catalog # BAD 5         12" EP

"Feedback Song" 
"Rema-Rema" 
"Instrumental" 
"Fond Affections"

Produced by Wally Brill and Rema-Rema.  Recorded live June 1979

"Instrumental" is interesting, with hints of things to come.  It's not an 
instrumental either, with the chorus repeating "You kicked me right between 
the eyes".  "Fond Affections" is the original version of that tune, later 
sung by Gordon Sharpe on the first THIS MORTAL COIL album.  This version is 
rougher, stripped down, bare, and the vocals are sung with a strong East London 
accent, as opposed to Sharpe's uncharacteristically tender reading on the later 
version.

THE BURDEN OF MULES     1983/84 4AD     Catalog # CAD 308       LP

"The Burden of Mules" 
"Complete and Utter" 
"Prostitute II" 
"Slow As A Child" 
"Journalists" 
"Give It Back" 
"On The Hill"

Produced by Mark Cox, Michael Allen, and John Madden. 
Engineered by John Madden.

Darker sounding than later LPs by TWP, less rhythm-heavy, with the vocals 
sounding more strained.  It marks the first appearance of Andrew Gray on 
guitar, drums and percussion.  He later becomes a full-time member of the 
band.  Additional drums and percussion are provided by Richard Thomas, later 
a member of the band Dif Juz.  Michael Allen plays drums, bass, synth, organ, 
piano, saxaphone, percussion, and vocals.  Mark Cox plays organ, clarinet, 
piano, synth, chimes, and bass.


SCARECROW               1984 4AD        Catalog # BAD 409       12" EP

"Respect"

"Ecstasy"

Recorded July, 1984.  Elizabeth Fraser (Cocteau Twins), backing vocals 
on "Respect".  Robin Guthrie (Cocteau Twins), guitar on "Respect", "Deserve"
and "Ecstasy".  Steve Young (Colourbox), keyboards and arrangement on
"Respect".  Eddie 'Tan-Tan' Thriller, trumpet on "Respect" and "Ecstasy".
"Respect" is a cover of the Otis Redding gem, made famous by Aretha, done
here very respectably, pardon the pun.  "Deserve" is a pounding dance tune,
and "Ecstasy" is a mariachi fanfare sort of a tune, used very well as the
finale tune on their next LP, THE LEGENDARY WOLFGANG PRESS AND OTHER TALL
STORIES.  That LP will be comprised of this EP, the WATER EP, and the
SWEATBOX EP.
