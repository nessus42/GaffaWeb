&gt; Does anyone out there have a video tape from Kate's concert
&gt; tour?  Do such even exist?  Pointers to information would be
&gt; appreciated if no one actually has such a tape.

Yes, there is video tape called "Kate Bush Live at the Hammersmith
Odeon".  It is 52 minutes long and in Beta-HiFi and VHS-HiFi.  It costs
about $55, but can be rented from some better video tape rental places.
It was taped in April 1979, and contains Moving, Them Heavy People,
Violin, Strange Phenomena, Hammer Horror, Don't Push Your Foot On The
Heartbrake, Wow, Feel It, Kite, James and the Cold Gun, Oh England My
Lionheart, and Wuthering Heights.  If you've never seen this, you must.
Kate put on the most elaborate concert possibly imaginable!
Unfortunately, video tape can't do it justice because I hear there were
all sorts of things going on that aren't in the frame.  Also, more than
half the concert is missing from the tape.  They taped the whole thing,
but cut out lots of stuff because it was made for a 1 hour TV slot.

In the concert there were also all sorts of neat instrumentals and stuff
between songs (while Kate quickly changed costumes) that are
missing from the tape.

&gt; Also, are there any full-length live recordings from that
&gt; tour that i could get my hands on?  Yes, I have the EP, but
&gt; that's just enough to whet my appetite.

Well, if you have or know someone with a HiFi video tape player, you can
probably make a decent tape from the concert video tape.  Other than
that, there are only bootleg recordings (can you say LOW fidelity?).
There is also a double bootleg record which contains the soundtrack to
the live video tape and to Kate's BBC Xmas special.

There is also a video tape of promo videos called "Kate Bush: The Single
File".  It contains promo videos for Wuthering Heights, Man With The
Child In His Eyes, Hammer Horror, Wow, Them Heavy People, Breathing,
Babooshka, Army Dreamers, Sat In Your Lap, The Dreaming, Suspended In
Gaffa, and There Goes A Tenner.  It was never released in the U.S., and
is only available as a Japanese import, which means it's very expensive
($70-$80)!  If you have a laser disk player, though, you can get the
laser disk for only $38!
