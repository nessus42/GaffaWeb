Hi everyone..

I love all of Kate's work so it is really hard to put the albums in any
kind of order. But this is how I would currently rank them:

1)Hounds Of Love - This was my first Kate album and it is the one that
introduced me to "alternative" music.  Kate's voice sounds terrific on
this album.  I can't tell you how many times I have listened to The Ninth
Wave, the volume turned up, the lights turned off.  I could rave about
this one all day long.  Absolutely wonderful.  

2)The Dreaming - Absolute genius!  I still find new things hidden in the
songs today, even after countless listens.  Awe-inspiring work. 
Brilliant.  Need I say more?  This album is very close to HOL for being
the favorite.

3)The Red Shoes - I really like the variety between the songs on this one.
 No one could ever accuse Kate of "10,000 Maniacs syndrome"!  This album
includes several songs that have become favorites of mine (Song of
Solomon, Lily, The Red Shoes, Moments of Pleasure).  This album works
slightly better for me as a whole than #4.

4)The Kick Inside - this has to be one of the most incredible debuts ever.
A few of my favorite Katesongs are here.  But some of my lesser liked
songs are here too (Feel It, L'amour Looks--)

5)The Sensual World - I liked this one a lot more when it came out than I
do now. Kate's voice seems rather lifeless to me.   I do love the title
track, This Woman's Work, and Rocket's Tail.  However, Heads We're Dancing
and Between a Man and a Woman are two of my least favorite Katesongs. 

6)Never for Ever - I hate putting this at #6, since this album contains
several great, much-loved songs (Babooshka, Breathing, Army Dreamers, the
Infant Kiss).  But Violin is quite possibly my very least favorite
Katesong.  This is very close to #5.

7)Lionheart - I really do like this album a lot, but something has to be
in last place. Sadly, there are more "lesser" songs than favorites here. 
I absolutely love Hammer Horror, however.  

So there you have it.  I wonder what direction Kate will go with her next
album.  Unfortunately, it will probably be several years before we find
out.  :(

Charles
