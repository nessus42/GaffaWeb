I posted this response to a query a couple of months ago and got no
enlightenment about the origin or value of these boxed sets.  Now that
everyone's back from the summer, could someone give us the scoop here?

In a previous article, sjw@infonaut.com (Steve Willis) says:

&gt;I also noticed in my local cd exchange a box with Kate in some green
&gt;leotard on the cover, called something like Kate the Lionhearted.  Of
&gt;course I had to see what was in the box:  A picture book full of Kate
&gt;glossies and a Lionheart cd.  Cost was $55 US.  What's up with that?

I've wondered about this ever since I bought it, along with a similar
package for _Never Forever_. They're both published by UFO Books, London,
and are nicely produced box sets. Contents:

_Kate Bush: A Lioness at Heart_
"Lionheart" CD
LP-sized book of Mankowitz photos
T-shirt, white, w/ KB "autograph" on front left.
Fold-open pink-hued "tank-top" poster
Color postcard of green leotard cover photo


_Kate Bush: Never Forever_
"Never Forever" CD
LP-sized book of phots, etc.
T-shirt, white, w/album title on front left.
fold-open brown-bordered poster of KB in chain mail w/sun (Delius?)
Colorful postcard of Kate in red by yellow flowers
"certificate of authenticity"

Both boxes are self-consciously packaged as "collectibles." First has
shrink-wrap sticker saying "Limited Edition of 1000".  Second had
"certificate" indicating a run of 1500.

Frankly, when I see a certificate like that I feel like I'm getting ripped
off.  It would be the easiest thing in the box to counterfeit!  At any rate,
finding them during the gap between TSW and TRS, I was delighted to pick up
some "fresh" material --at least I hadn't seen a lot of the photos.  

I'm curious what the "word" is on these, too. Seems clear Kate had nothing
to do with their production.  They seem awfully well-constructed for
"bootleg" type materials.  I think I paid a similar price, something over
$50 each.
