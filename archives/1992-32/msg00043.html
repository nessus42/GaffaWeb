I am not kyrlidis@athena.mit.edu (Angelos Kyrlidis).  I didn't say:
&gt;Jon wants to remix happy! Is that a compliment or what? ;)

maybe.  maybe not...

so far in my professional career i've had to do two songs (three mixes) that
i found unbelievably distasteful.  ever heard of rozalla?  she's a terrible
lightweight pop dance music songstress (her big hit was "everybody's free to
feel good") and we had to churn out two mixes of "are you ready to fly" in a
few days.  churn was definitely the operative word here, cos that's what my
bowels were doing.  the record company sent us a tape of her vocal track
(and nothing else) with a sheet explaining that it would allow for "maximum
creativity" (read: "we're too cheap to give you the backing tracks.")  yeah
and monkeys might fly outta my butt.  but i digress...

so we sweated and slaved and they didn't even wind up using them.  we did
put one of them out on twitch, but it wasn't quite the same thrill.

on the other hand, epic is putting out a promo 12" of the new prefab sprout
track with our remix on it, and i'm getting a full credit despite the fact
that all i contributed was about 10 seconds worth of hi hat programming.

&gt;YES YES YES!!! I would love to here a remix of two Happy Rhodes songs. One
&gt;is 'Poetic Justice' and one is 'Wrong Century'. They are both very rhythmic
&gt;and especially the first one isn't done justice :) by the album version.
&gt;The live version was amazing, and inspired me to write an accompanying rap
&gt;for it, and Greg was going to work on a noize/rap/techno version of poetic
&gt;Justice, but then he went to New Jersey (Hi footah!). Anyway, Jon, if you
&gt;are interested in remixing either of these songs, if you still have them 
&gt;that is (I assume that after your review of Vickie's sampler you threw the tape
&gt;away :) ), please let us know. I am sure there are ectophiles out there who 
&gt;would love to hear PoJo remixed, and given Happy's status as fan-friendly, who
&gt;knows they might even release it if they like it!!! 

they weren't on the original tape as far as i can remember (which admittedly
isn't very far).  i didn't throw the tape out - i gave it to ex-love-hound
extraordinaire tracy roberts.  she's since vanished off the face of the
earth.

so like i said, get me a tape of the vocal track and the finished mix for
reference.

Milk, you practically entombed that old bag with spew and puke!  TERRIFIC!
