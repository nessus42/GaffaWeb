&gt; Hello!
&gt; 
&gt; Gosh (!) it's been quiet lately!  Why don't we all reminisce?  What was the 
&gt; first KaTe song everybody heard and how/where did they hear it?  Of course
&gt; maybe you've all gone over this before, in which case someone think of
&gt; something else.
&gt;

I like this question! OK, I had heard Kate many a times but never was 
aware of who it was or anything so I'll recount my first time when I was 
cognizant of the fact. It was at a friends house in early '86 (Jan or so) 
when she wanted to play an album that she bought as an experiement. My 
first thought was "oh great she's gonna pawn it off on me to get her 
money back!" Well, the first thing I heard was Jig of Life...I jumped out 
of the chair..WHOA cool Irish folk! I then looked at the album and sleeve 
and was immediately entranced. I asked to hear Waking the Witch, it looke 
d interesting. She didn't want to play it at first but then gave in to my 
demands. When I heard "go down ye red red roses..." I leaped out of my 
skin, not just the chair...to think SHE, this stranger, knows that 
whaling song. Well I offered my friend twice the amount she paid for the 
record but she wouldn't sell it, I had to get my own...thus began 
history.
                     Kateness,
                           Lionheart
