&gt;REGARDING                which maniac?
&gt;people:

&gt;For some reason I woke up this morning with a strong urge to buy some 10,000
&gt;Maniacs. So I put forth the never answerable question: With which album
&gt;should I start? Just to keep Love-Hounds clean you might consider mailing to
&gt;me directly instead of thru the list but whatever.

&gt;obKaTe: All the recent sexual orientation vs. kate talk makes me even more
&gt;glad that Measure 9 failed here in Oregon. The OCA intrudes into peoples
&gt;private preferences too much to already to add Kate to the list!

&gt;more obKate: Back in my much younger days I had also assumed most male
&gt;KaTefen (tm) were attracted to her at least half because of her looks. Sure
&gt;her singing on that Saturday Night Live eons past sent my brain reeling but
&gt;seeing her slink around that piano sent a bullet straight to my gut!

&gt;to'c

&gt;--
&gt;"A typical long haired half mad computer programmer on a typical computer
&gt;keyboard with odd toys scattered liberally about."

DON'T start with the new album, Our Time In Eden...it really bites.  The
Wishing Chair is kind of folksy/indie, In My Tribe is poppy but well-made,
Blind Man's Zoo is alternative and dark.  I started with BMZ and then IMT,
and I would recommend either one highly.  The rerelease album, Hope Chest,
is also cool but I wouldn't start with it.  Get the Blue one or the Purple
one.  Let me know what you think!

To all who read this: drop the orientation thing.  It's irrelevant and
mighty offensive, especially to us bi's.

I almost never like an artist for looks.  You can't see Kate while you're
listening to her music.  Make no mistake, she's exquisite, but I'd be
insulted if I were accused of listening to her on the basis of sex.  Her
music is transcendent and that's the sum of it.
