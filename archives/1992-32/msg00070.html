&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;For some reason I woke up this morning with a strong urge to buy some 10,000
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Maniacs. So I put forth the never answerable question: With which album
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;should I start?
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; DON'T start with the new album, Our Time In Eden...it really bites.

it doesn't bite!

&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I don't know about _bites_, but don't start with it.
&gt; 
&gt;Well, bites is a strong word...but when only 1/3 of the album is really
&gt;worth listening to, I get pretty disappointed.  I love the Maniacs and I
&gt;wish they had made a different album...maybe it's Paul Fox's fault, maybe
&gt;not.

I must admit that I like Our Time in Eden very much. I've noticed that not
alot of people like it that but it appeals to me very much. Probably because
it wasn't what I had expected...but I was pleasantly surprised.:-)

&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I say: don't start with Blind Man's Zoo.  No, no, no.
&gt; 
&gt;Why not?  Blind Man's Zoo is coherent, well-made, lyrically excellent, dark
&gt;and lush...in a word, wonderful.  If I hadn't started with this album I
&gt;might not have listened to them at all...I think it's the best one they've
&gt;made.
&gt;
I agree that Blind Man's Zoo is wonderful but I wouldn't start with it.
I would recommend In My Tribe for anyone not familiar with 10,000 Maniacs.


&gt;&gt; 
&gt;I think it might be difficult to get S of the IC, as to my knowledge it's no
&gt;longer being pressed.  Most of the music from it went onto Hope Chest.  And
&gt;I play BMZ again and again and again and it still sounds great.  What's your
&gt;problem with it?

Everything on Secrets of the I Ching is on the Hope Chest. I had a tape of
SofIC taped off a record (horrible sound quality) and all the songs on that
tape were on the cd Hope Chest. The other songs come from Human Factor Number
5.

&gt; 
&gt;Still, from the sound of your musical tastes maybe you'd be best off
&gt;starting with Hope Chest or In My Tribe--probably IMT.  Wishing Chair is
&gt;good but pretty simplistic as far as style and chords go...it's better left
&gt;to the experienced 10,000 Maniacs fan.

for your information, these are all their albums (that I'm aware of)
Human Factor No. 5        --both of these are complete on 
Secrets of the I Ching    --the Hope chest. I doubt you will find them
                            anywhere else.      

The Wishing Chair         --the cd contains tracks not on the tape or album

In My Tribe               --newer cds don't have the song Peace Train

Blind Man's Zoo
Hope Chest
Our Time in Eden
