When the true victim of this crime showed up (that means the rightful 
card holder) I was given a look at the billing statement. This woman went 
joyriding with the card to different music stores, clothing stores (and I 
mean expensive clothing too) and auto body shops to get fancy extras for 
her car (the owner had already been to that shop so knew what she 
purchased there), having knowledge of this I doubt seriously that she was 
a poor victim of any system or just wanted to get gifts for a poor Kate 
fan. Call me a stoic but I don't think one's plight in life gives an 
excuse to victimize another whether it's the card holder, a store or 
Kate. If something's wrong then fix i, don't add to it which is what 
theft does. I also think you idealize Kate a bit too much. I could care 
less if she stole candy as a child but I have my reservations she would 
condone such behavior in adults, and on a much more pricey scale --- 
remember Kate herself has been a victim of burglarly. Have you ever been 
robbed in any manner? If you have try to recall that feeling of emptiness 
and hopelessness, not because you no longer have a material possession 
but because a violation had been committed against you. I know the risks 
of being in business, they're just like the risks involved in breathing, 
eating, sleeping...life is a risk. I will make a sweeping moral statement 
about stealing being bad; it's about time people took responsibility for 
their own actions instead of finding scape goats as to why they acted 
liek a child (taking candy?).
                    Kateness,
                           Jackie
