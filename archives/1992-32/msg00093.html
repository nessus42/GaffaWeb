        Regarding the notion that Kate used to steal as a child, I have 
no info on whether or not that was true, (yet I somehow doubt it).  
REgarding the idea that she would somehow condone stealing of her 
music, or anything else, the only quote I can think of is the 
following.  She doesn't come out and say "stealing is bad", and she doe 
s say that "it isn't worth it."  

        The quote is regarding "there goes a tennor"


Yeah.  What made you think about it?  I mean, have you run into these 
east end types before?
        No, no.  I think it was much more the thing of watching a lot 
of films, things like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, you know.  
There are lots of films where robberies take place and yet they glorify 
them, they always make the robbery something very heroic and fun, risky 
and dangerous, but for me it's something incredibly scary, something 
that has such a potential of going wrong that it's not worth the risk, 
and I don't think it's something that should be glorified at all.  I 
think it's something that should be made very real, so that people 
realize it's not worth the effort - it's not something that's fun, it's 
something that's just not worth the effort.  You'll end up in gaol for 
thirty years!
