&gt;&gt;&gt;I would highly recommend checking out a group called
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;   THE INNOCENCE MISSION
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;if you can find their albums.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;The first debut album is very Tori-ish.  The second album sounds
&gt;&gt;&gt;like a cross between the 10,000 Maniacs and the Cocteau Twins, at least
&gt;&gt;&gt;to me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;- Bako -
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hmmm.  Interesting.  I got this album as a review copy for the student paper
&gt;&gt;here, and didn't like it at ALL.  I couldn't understand a word the singer was
&gt;&gt;saying.  All the songs sounded the same, and all but one or two seemed 
&gt;&gt;practically tuneless.
&gt;&gt;


Ack!  I forgot that I posted here, and my post got posted without a subject and
I never bothered checking the &lt;no subject here&gt;s to see if anyone replied.  And
people obviously replied...

&gt;Which album? I assume you are referring to their second album called "Umbrella"
&gt;I think. 

That's the one...

&gt;BTW, what is "tuneless" and what is a "tune".  Is is something desirable?
&gt;Should all songs have to conform to this "tune" structure?  Is recognition
&gt;of a songs lyrics important?  I can't understand much of Elvis Costello's
&gt;lyrics, yet I think most would agree that he writes great lyrics.  I've seen
&gt;many a message on this newsgroup asking for lyrics to Kate songs.  

Tuneless.  Hmmm.  Maybe "melodiousness" would be better.  It's not that I'm
looking for some kind of catchy hummable tune, but it'd be nice to have some
way of telling one song from another.
As for lyrics -- no, I don't consider it that necessary to understand the
lyrics (after all, I do like R.E.M.) but since I didn't like the music, either,
the fact that I couldn't understand a word she said also helped me to dislike
this band.

&gt;I can see not liking Umbrella, but I would have thought different reasoning
&gt;from a reader of this group (no flame intended).

I was a bit surprised, myself.  I was all excited because the press kit said
that IM's influences were Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel.  I was looking forward
to some really great stuff; it's not like I listened to it expecting not to
like it.
