	disco -- 1. A nightclub that is usually characterized by showy
	decor and special lighting effect that features recorded,
	electronically amplified music for dancing.

Spit (which played RUTH while I was there) doesn't have showy decor, but
it *does* have the spinning colored lights etc.

	2. a. Popular dance music characterized by strong repetetive
	bass rhythms.

Sound familiar?  A four note synth hook doesn't hurt either!

In any case, Jim Hofmann is right -- labels are stupid!  There are these
record stores that have a separate section for new wave music, and they
always seem to put Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel in the "new wave" section,
and I can never find them!  KB and PG "new wave"???  And they put Bebop
Deluxe in the "rock" section, but Bill Nelson in the "new wave" section.
Talk about confusion!  These record stores exist just to drive me crazy!

I originally called RUTH "disco" because I was upset with it.  Then I
called it "disco" because it has shock value.  I mean who would have
ever expected Kate Bush to come out with a dance song?!?  But isn't that
one of the reasons why she's so great?  You just can't predict her.  Who
could have *ever* predicted anything like "Jig of Life"?

&gt;&gt; Yeah!  That silly Fairlight hook in RUTH is the only thing on the
&gt;&gt; album I don't like!  If I only could go into the studio and remove
&gt;&gt; that hook.  If I only could oh....

&gt; Ouch!  You DON'T like it!  I think it's one of the best things about
&gt; the song.  Check that--the best thing.  If it wasn't for that "silly
&gt; Fairlight hook" the song would be pretty shallow and sound like a
&gt; military marching rhythm.

The best thing?  What about the amazing lyrics?  And beautiful vocals?
(Actually the *best* thing about the song is that it's the music to the
most amazing video ever made!)

I like strong rhythms -- they are natural and primitive and earthy and
fundamental to human nature.  I don't like simple repetetive overly-catchy
four-note melodies -- they are a product of the Pepsi generation.  The
"hook" in RUTH, as Jim said, is saved by the fact that instead of being
sappy happy, something has been done to it to make it haunting and
mournful.

After getting used to the strong repetative rhyth of RUTH, I have come
to like it a lot, because Kate's vocals aren't slave to it and other
intruments' rhythms weave in and out.  There is other drumming too going
on that isn't slaved to the repetative drum beat.  These other drums
appear here and there at random and are pretty erratic and unpredictable.

Boy do I hate people that quote from dictionaries!

-Doug

P.S.  On V66 they are using some of the music from RUTH in one of their
commercials!  You hear the distinctive drum beat and then this voice
talks over it saying "V66 rocks!"  I guess this means that Kate is now
truly doing "commercial" music, huh?
