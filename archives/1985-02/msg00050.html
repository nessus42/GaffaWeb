In the 11-24 Sep 85 Smash Hits there is a review of "Hounds of Love".
"Hounds of Love" is their pick of the month:

	If you for a moment imagined that "Running Up That Hill" was a
	fluke then one listen to this will put you right.  Side one is
	crammed with songs that are just as good and even side two's
	ambitious concept piece about a drowning girl ("The Ninth Wave")
	is surprizingly successful.

Hmmph!  "Even side two"???  How about "even side one's collection of
commercial love songs is surprizingly successful", instead.

	In fact the only possible drawback is that it's the sort of
	record your parents will probably like too and pinch off you to
	play.

I dunno about that!  Whenever I play "The Dreaming" when my mother's
around, she says "Couldn't you play something in your more mainstream
tastes -- like Pink Floyd?"  Then again, "The Ninth Wave" is quite
Floydian at times....

	(9 out of 10).  Chris Heath.

In the 14 Sep 85 issue of Melody Maker there is an announcement for the
release of "Hounds of Love":

	Kate Bush releases her fifth album on September 16.  "Hounds of
	Love" -- written and produced by Kate Bush -- divides into two
	sections.  Side one comprises five tracks, including the hit
	single "Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)".  All five songs
	on side one are thematic -- "describing fundamental differences
	between the sexes and how differences lead to misunderstanding
	in relationships."

No, they don't!  "Mother Stands For Comfort" is about nothing of the
sort!  It's a love song to mom.  Perhaps the other four songs could be
described that way, but I would say that they are more about being
scared of love and overcoming this problem.  I'm not sure how "Mother
Stands For Comfort" fits into this theme.

In the 14 Sep 85 issue of Sounds, there are two letters regarding Kate
Bush.  One is a letter from a representative of EMI denying all rumors
that EMI interfered with the album at all.  EMI claims that the album is
*exactly* the way Kate wanted it to be.  They claim that the album was
delayed because Kate was unsatisfied with parts of it, and wanted to
re-record those parts.

There is a lot of evidence, though, that EMI pressured Kate to change
the name of "A Deal With God" to "Running Up That Hill" and that this
caused a several month delay because all the artwork had to be redone.

The other letter is from a Kate Bush fan who is upset that some people
are comparing Kate with Madonna.  I haven't seen anyone do such a thing,
thank goodness.  Where are they?  I'll kill them!
