&gt; I mean, I still really love ALL Kate's albums and "Wuthering Heights"
&gt; is still one of my favorites (I know, I know, "commercial", but so what!
&gt; it's marvelous!) but the concentration of unbelievably-wonderful-goodness
&gt; that is "The Dreaming" is incredible!

I don't think "Wuthering Heights" is "commercial".  It just commercially
was an incredible success for some unknown reason (it is said by some
that Kate made a couple million pounds off of that song alone).  EMI
wanted "James And The Cold Gun" to be the first single but Kate
insisted.  This is one of the reasons that EMI now lets Kate do just
about whatever she wants to.

"Babooshka", which is the only KB song I'm not so wild about, seems
blatently commercial to me.  Also four of the five songs on the A-side
of "Hounds of Love" (everything except for "Mother Stands for Comfort"
-- oooh what a great song!) seem blatently commercial, but they are
*great* anyway!

&gt; Am I now supposed to believe that "Love Hounds" is going to approach
&gt; this?  If so, I don't think I'll be able to stand it!!  But what a way
&gt; to go....

Everything on "Hounds of Love" at least approaches the quality of "The
Dreaming", and the side "The Ninth Wave" doesn't "approach" -- it is
every bit as good!  You're right -- I can't stand it either!  What can
she do now?  Where is there left to go?  Oh, I can't wait three more
years for more!

&gt; Anyone know of any KB specials on MTV?

Hah!

Maybe on Night Flight once every other year....

&gt; What KB video-cassettes are there and where do I get them?

There are two.  Each one is about 50 minutes long.  "Kate Bush Live" is
part of one of her concerts from 1979.  It costs about $50.  "Kate Bush:
The Single File" is a collection of some of her videos ranging from
"Wuthering Heights" to "There Goes a Tenner".  This is a Jappanese
import and thus is outrageously expensive at $75.  I can probably dig up
mail order addresses (especially for the "The Single File") if you want.
You can probably find either of these at a Tower Records.  "Kate Bush
Live" can be sometimes be found in really good rental places.

&gt; Also, does anyone know definitively what KB albums are out on CD and
&gt; which ones aren't?  It TD just hard to find? Or never releaed on CD?
&gt; How about "Never Forever"?

"Never for Ever" is being released on CD sometime soon.  All her other
albums are on CD except "The Dreaming".

&gt; From: valerie%sdcc13@SDCSVAX.ARPA (Valerie Polichar)

&gt; I think we all had similar experiences, Kevin - it sounded kind of
&gt; abrasive and noisy the first few times, but by the third or fourth
&gt; time around, the different lines emerged from her complex tracking and
&gt; it all became - AMAZING....

The first several times I heard "The Dreaming", I thought it was *the*
most annoying abrasive noise I had ever heard!  I took a lot of effort
not to turn off the stereo, but it was such interesting abrasive noise
that I took it as a challenge to continue to listen to it.  Well, you
all know what I think of it now!

But actually, I also found "The Kick Inside" (which I bought several
months after "The Dreaming") to be pretty abrasive!  I certainly wasn't
expecting that above-soprano brittle wailing voice!

&gt; I don't think HOL is quite as multi-layered (maybe fewer tracks ?
&gt; which would be odd since she just invested in her own studio, so she's
&gt; probably got the equipment to do it, but maybe she just didn't want to
&gt; (?)  ), but it sounds pleasantly like a blend between The Dreaming and
&gt; her earlier albums.

A lot of the album is simpler than "The Dreaming".  This is probably
because in England, nearly every critic said of "The Dreaming" that it
was "overproduced", "confused", and "muddled".  But there are several
tracks on HOL which certainly have as much going on in them as anything
on "The Dreaming".  e.g. "The Big Sky" and "Waking The Witch".

&gt; Not bad, but not the gorgeousness of TD - still, I've no complaints!
&gt; It's Kate, it's gotta be good, no?

Overall, HOL isn't as good as "The Dreaming", but I think the B-side,
"The Ninth Wave", is every bit as good.
