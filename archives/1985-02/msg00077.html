[Doug:]
&gt;In any case, with me refering to RUTH as disco (to reply to
&gt;Shelli), I meant disco as "music specially crafted for the contemporary
&gt;dance market".  There's lots of danceable music that I wouldn't call
&gt;disco (like funk?), but "disco" it would seem almost by definition is
&gt;what they play in discos, and they are playing RUTH in discos. 

What *is* a "disco"???  What self-respecting CLUB (especially in Boston)
calls itself a disco?  Spit, etc. call themselves "dance clubs".  Therefore,
what they play must be "dance music."  Right?  I just want disco to be one
of those dated words that with the passing of time has no more meaning.

&gt;&gt; Speaking of RUTH (ever hear the story about Ruth from the bible?), um,
&gt;&gt; that little synth line that bridges the opening into the chorus.  It
&gt;&gt; sounds like a 70's disco hook.

&gt;Yeah!  That silly Fairlight hook in RUTH is the only thing on the album
&gt;I don't like!  If I only could go into the studio and remove that hook.
&gt;If I only could oh....

Ouch!  You DON'T like it!  I think it's one of the best things about
the song.  Check that--the best thing.  If it wasn't for that "silly
Fairlight hook" the song would be pretty shallow and sound like a military
marching rhythm.

&gt;&gt; Side 1 (Hounds Of love) is commercial, and the photo on that side
&gt;&gt; is glossy, airbrushed (sex-kittenish if you will...)

&gt;Yeah, but she's in bed with two dogs.  Kinky!  Not exactly mainstream
&gt;sex-kittenish....

Well, after seeing the video for Hammer Horror, I am now sure that Kate
does not feel compelled whatsoever to adhere to mainstream sexuality.

[Kevin Caruso:]
&gt;ps.  TD didn't really get to me until the third or fourth listen.  Is this
&gt;     true for everyone?  Now, (after n listens) it only gets better and
&gt;     better and better...

Okay, listen to this...the first time I heard The Dreaming, I said that
she sounded like a cross between Dolly Parton and Minnie Mouse!  I've
been doing penance for that remark ever since, but still, I think that
that's the average reaction for most people.  It took me 3 or 4 (complete)
listens before I really started to appreciate it...but now of course, 
there's no turning back.
