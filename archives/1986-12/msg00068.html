     [It entails just telling me that you want to be on the mailing
      list, and giving me a network address to mail to.  -- Doug]
 
  3. Ok, this is about what I've read so far in mod.music.gaffa (which is 
     essentially the LH mailing list, right?)...

     [Yup. -- Doug]
 
     a) I think your (collective) idea for the T-shirt is, to put it mildly,
        -=*GREAT*=-!  If it all possible the picture from The Dreaming (as
        mentioned) or the EP of RUTH (that right?) would be perfect for the
        front.  How do I go about getting on a list for one?

     [Nothing concrete has been done about this yet.  If something is
      done about it, an anouncement will be made for orders to be
      placed.  Hopefully, this will be done sometime in the near
      future.  -- Doug]

     b) Someone mentioned that the sonar really is from a submarine.  Well,
        it's certainly possible but it is equally possible that any
        naval ship would also have sonar.  Being rescued by a sub or a
        ship would not be an aweful lot different since the sub would
        have to surface away from you to pick you up.  I'm not to sure
        about subs having lights on them either...it doesn't seem
        right for a military vessel (how many private ones ARE there?)
        to broadcast it's location with lights...Oh, well.

	[But the German voice that you hear right before the sonar
        says "Deeper.  Deeper.  Somewhere in the depths, there is a
        light."  This seems to indicate a submarine.  And just the
        fact that the voice is  in German is enough to hint at
        U-boats.]
 
     c) Last one...This one refers to the comments about the lyrics to 
        _Waking_the_Witch_.  I'd always thought she was saying "tell
        them, baby" as well.  All the excitement in her voice could
        well be panic at the thought of what will happen...I'll have
        to go home and listen to that track again myself, VERY
        CAREFULLY :-).
 
  4. Merci! (Bilinguilism strikes again [guffaw])
 

         James    (JRS/Elendil in other contexts....)
