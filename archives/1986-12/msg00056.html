	Subject: AW, FERKATESAKE!
	
	Got the new issue (Number 10) of Break-Through today.
	IED will sound very cheap and sleazy for the following
	criticism, since his last letter to Robyn (mentioning Love-Hounds)
	is re-printed over two entire pages and is accompanied by his translation
	of the French interview (you saw it in Love-Hounds first!),
	but nonetheless he feels compelled to speak out in protest!
	
	Robyn and Dale have, in their own words, decided "to
	fully embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ," and want to know
	whether readers are ready for Christian texts in future
	issues of Break-Through. This is a realdrag. What peculiar
	sort of arrogance is it that makes newly religious people seem to feel
	that it's appropriate to spread their religiousness to others?

I don't really understand why it's arrogance.  Say that you have just
been *HIT OVER THE HEAD* with good luck.  You naturally enough, want
to tell people, not necessarily to cause jealousy, but simply because
it's a *good thing*.

Suppose furthermore that it's not an exclusive sort of luck (like
winning a million dollars), but something that can be shared with
other people without depriving yourself (more like winning a money
tree--something that's completely unlimited in its scope).  Wouldn't
you be some kind of a genuine creep to keep that to yourself--when
telling other people would do them good, and you no harm?

You may disagree that religion has these benefits--but please understand
that from the point of view of the other person, talking about their
new interest is the right thing to do.
