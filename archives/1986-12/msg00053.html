<PRE>
Got the new issue (Number 10) of Break-Through today.
IED will sound very cheap and sleazy for the following
criticism, since his last letter to Robyn (mentioning Love-Hounds)
is re-printed over two entire pages and is accompanied by his translation
of the French interview (you saw it in Love-Hounds first!),
but nonetheless he feels compelled to speak out in protest!

Robyn and Dale have, in their own words, decided "to
fully embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ," and want to know
whether readers are ready for Christian texts in future
issues of Break-Through. This is a realdrag. What peculiar
sort of arrogance is it that makes newly religious people seem to feel
that it's appropriate to spread their religiousness to others?
What conceivable relevance could Robyn and Dale's spiritual
beliefs have for their readership, which is made up of a wide
variety of people whose only MUTUAL interest is Kate Bush?
This whole "Christ and Kate" business strikes IED as weird in the extreme
and slightly dirty, and he cannot express vividly enough
how greatly he deplores its invasion into Break-Through.

God help Kate.

It was bad enough when Robyn started filling pages with
photos of dead animals, but now we are in for who knows what
kind of proselityzing. Never before has there been needed
so badly the famous phrase:

           SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND KATE!

Aside from this extremely ominous and noxious new development,
however, the
latest issue of Break-Through is up to its usual standard.
