&gt;I have it from a reliable source that there is more than one version of
&gt;"The Golden Age of Wireless."   The common version has a mock magazine cover
&gt;on the front with a cartoon of TD surrounded by tubes and wires and all sorts
&gt;of great technogeek stuff.  The "other" version features a simple picture of
&gt;TD with a wire running through his head.

Actually, the pic is, if I recall, TD standing on some sort of a
platform with a weird sculpture in back of him.  I'll take a glance
at my copy tonight and see for sure.

&gt;The "other" version of TGAW has different mixes some songs and some totally
&gt;new stuff (new=preveously unheard by me).  

The "other" version is actually the ORIGINAL version.  It was released
by Harvest/Capitol Records right here in the US, and it did less than
boffo business.  However, then came "She Blinded Me With Science," and
Capitol saw its chance to make a quick buck -- it removed two of the
songs from the original "Wireless" LP, "Leipzig" and "Urges," and 
stuck on "Blinded" and "One Of Our Submarines."  The other songs are
not different mixes, as far as I can tell.   

&gt;To the previous respondees of my Dolby questions, WHERE CAN I GET THIS ALBUM?
&gt;I HAVE TO HAVE ONE!!  I'LL PAY ANY AMOUNT, OR DO ANYTHING (!) TO GET IT!

Calm down Scott.  I have no idea what the record stores in and near
Hillsboro are like, but all you need is the handy "Leipzig"/"Urges" 7",
which was Thomas' very first release.  Then you'll have his complete
canon (you haven't picked up the Godawful Howard the Duck soundtrack,
have you?)  The 7" is import only, and since it was an indie release
it's not all that common, but my friend and fellow l-h Laurah has it
(maybe if you bribe her enough...!)  If you want, I'll check my fave
record store and see if they have a copy.  

Speaking of that store, they have all these KB singles from other
countries, like Spain, which they charge exorbitant prices for, if
anyone is diehard enough to be interested.  

&gt;I have no idea if it's an import or where it's from.  I suppose I should
&gt;check with Tower Records, but they never have anything interesting.

Forget it.  If it's out of print, it won't be at Tower, for the most
part.

&gt;Scott Peterson, Intel Corp., Hillsboro, OR, ...!tektronix!ogcvax!omssw1!sdp

Do you have Thomas' cover of Joni Mitchell's "The Jungle Line"?  Every
time I see it, it's prohibitively expensive, but one of these days
maybe...
