&gt; couldnt agree more about "company of wolves", and can reccomentd another
&gt; film in a rather different vein, but just as styalised in its way, "diva"
&gt; director dunno, its a french film, and very very good.

Diva was directed by Jean-Jacques Beineix, and I second the recommendation.


&gt; Really-From: Nancy Everson &lt;everson@spca.bbn.com&gt;

&gt; I have a question about the Cocteau Twins.  I'm not terribly familiar with
&gt; their music, but I can recognize them when I hear them on the radio.  I
&gt; like what I have heard on the radio, but I don't know enough to go out and
&gt; buy any of their cd's.  Peter Alfke seems to really like _Garlands_.  I
&gt; know there was a pretty big discussion about CT albums a couple of months
&gt; ago, but I didn't really learn enough to convince me that a certain album
&gt; would be a good first CT album to get.  Would _Garlands_ be a good
&gt; introduction?  I heard a song yesterday on WZBC that was from
&gt; _Victorialand_.  (I think the song had something to do with April, or March
&gt; or something.)  I really liked that song - it was pretty, with acoustic
&gt; guitar, and nice vocals, and nice to listen to.  Is all of _Vict._ like
&gt; that?  Maybe that would be a good first CT album?  Please help out a
&gt; potential CT fan!

The song you heard was "Throughout the Dark Months of April and May", and yes,
all of Victorialand is pretty much like it.  My favorite CT album is Treasure,
but then I haven't heard Garlands.  I have heard The Pink Opaque and Tiny
Dynamine/Echoes in a Shallow Bay CDs (the former is a collection of tracks
from various other albums, the latter is a pair of EPs).


Has anybody seen any of these on CD yet?  They have supposedly just been
released:
  Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyptians   Fegmania!
  Sex Pistols     Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle
  Velvet Underground   VU
