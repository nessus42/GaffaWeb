Lyrics first, plug later:

	Most of the day
	We were at the machinery
	In the dark sheds
	That the seasons ignore
	I held the levers that guided the signals to the radio
	But the words I receive, random code, broken fragments from
		before.

	Out in the trees
	My reason deserting me
	All the dark stars
	Cluster over the bay.

	Then in a certain moment
	I lose control and at last I am part of the machinery.

	(The belldog) Where are you?
	And the light disappears
	As the world makes its circle through the sky.

Lyrics are from the awesome book "More Dark than Shark", which
comprises the (nearly) compleat Eno lyrics, paintings by Robert Mills,
and commentary by both of the above and Rick Poynor. There are four
pages devoted to The Belldog. It's one of the best commentaries in the
book.

The book is available at Wordsworth ($25) as well as your favorite
pompous poseur import overpriced record store ($35 at Newbury
Goldmine (sarcasm flag)).

It is an imported paperback book, 144 pp full color (ISBN
0-571-13883-7, faber &amp; faber Ltd, 3 Queen Square, London WC1N 3AU.
#16.50 list net price).

I love everything about it, except that it is lacking the lyrics to
"Here Come the Warm Jets". If anybody knows any of the words to that,
please send them along. (There's an interesting story about how Eno
purposely buried the words in the mix, and burned the notebook pages
that had them, so as not to be able to tell what they were. It is
widely believed that "warm jets" refers to urination.

ps. I am not a Kate Bush fan, therefore, I do not deserve the "love
hound" handle, but I read this list since it has so much a higher
content rating and so much lower a reposting/analysis/pissing rating
than net.more_flames_about_ART_and_noise (alias net.music). 

pps. The book also has the lyrics to the infamous Tzima Narki. I won't
post them here since ASCII doesn't support backward character set
(they're printed that way in the book!).

"You gave me precious information
 on that imaginary morning" (so I lied)..............................bc
