Re: KT-shirts

Sounds great, John. IED's all in favor of using what sounds
like your vast network of T-shirt-making experts. We have to
see the design, however, unless we can describe it very precisely
in Love-Hounds.

About Doug's reminder that it was going to be a "Dreaming"
t-shirt, o.k., but you're just talking about the picture part of
the design, and maybe the quotation on the back, right, Doug?
The front of the shirt should still say "Love-Hounds" on it.
Also, there are several great lines that could
be used as the quotation, not just the "Houdini" line. Still,
that IS a great line; IED approves.

So, we've got "Love-Hounds" in HoL script (or the closest thing
to it that's available) on the front at the top, with the
lines: "An international / Kate Bush / computer forum" printed
below that, in smaller blocks, upper- and lower-case. There should
still be room for the picture below that. If we use a photo, remember
that for a good silkscreen the original can't be too dark, should
have a lot of contrast and very clear contour lines. The Dreaming
cover is a pretty good candidate in this regard; even better on
these counts is the Ninth Wave outer cover photo, at least the
section of the photo with Kate's face.

Then, on the back, the quotation, two or three lines long, in
HoL script, and below that either "Kate Bush" or better yet
the KT logo. After all, it's pretty obvious from the front that
the quotation on the back is by Kate, right? We don't want this
shirt to seem too obvious.Or we could just have the title on the
front, and put the picture on the back.

The only thing is, IED thought it cost a certain amount of money
per letter for these things, isn't that right? Does the estimate
John made include any length of quotation? Also, how sharp and
small can the letters be?
