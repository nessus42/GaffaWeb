&gt; [Shelli:] But here's the good news: Doug has agreed to move to Los
&gt; Angeles so that he can throw a party you are able to attend.

What?  Move away from the hometown of Shelli?  Someone must be giving
you false rumours!  (Or is this a hint?)

In any case, many thanks to all the Love-Hounds who came to the party
and to everyone who brought beer or food or friends or whatever.  I
hope that everyone had a good time.  If anyone thinks I didn't do
something quite right, please tell me -- I've never thrown a party
before, and would like to get better at it.  Sorry that my appartment
is so small, but I can't do much about that without moving.

&gt; I agree it was a smashing success, but Doug has *got* to get a more
&gt; confortable sofa.

Yeah, but isn't my fouton comfortable enough?

&gt; BTW: I sat here the other day with every single solitary person at
&gt; work listening the the controversial line in "Waking the Witch".  We
&gt; have all come to the conclusion that you Doug, have a dirty mind.  I
&gt; have 8 votes for "TELL THEM" and zero for "COME".

Parler quoi?  Moi, have a dirty mind???  Actually, I can hear it
either way.  In fact, I told Mr. Turner that.  I never even thought
about what it said until a large bunch of friends of mine insisted to
me that it says "Listen to me come, baby".  The thing is, that makes
perfect sense, and "Listen to me tell them, baby" doesn't make much
sense at all.  Of course, it could also, as IED maintains be "Listen
to me!  Come, baby!"

			"Desperate for more,"
