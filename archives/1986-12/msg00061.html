Unfortunately for me, I guess, I had religion (Christian, even) about 18
years ago, but somehow lost it.  I often ask myself, should I try to find it
again but somehow that self of mine I ask is apparently on vacation or not
answering the phone.  Occasionally, an even will happen in my life after
which I feel that somehow that religion I lost is out to get me (the morning
after the Katemas party, for example), alas with the passing of time
that old-time religion just stays lost.  Several important philosophical
questions can be raised here (1) Can lost religion be found and (2) what
is the cost benefit ratio associated with the finding of lost religion.  It
would make my Navy life easier if I could say something meaningful when
someone needs to know my religion for form-filling (they won't let you say
none but you can substitute Unitarian Universalist which has a code # that
Navy computers will allow).
IED, I am all for getting some religion into Love-Hounds.  If we show enough
interest, maybe Kate will see the light and do an album of songs of faith
and hope, and get it sold on late night TV right along with the Slim
Whitman compilations.  Shit, a better idea would be to use some marvels of
audio trickery and superimpose Kate background vocals on Elvis' songs of
inspiration (Kate and Elvis? Who knows, could go a long way).  Just think
the commetcials could have Jimmy Swaggert(SP?) explaining that a former
heathen has become a lamb and has changed her waws from the Waking of the
Witch to Swing Low Sweet Chariot.
Well, if anyone finds my lost religion, please notify me so I can ask it if
it really wants to stay lost or come back.  In the meantime I think I am
going to play some old ELO records backwards, that should strike the fear
of God into my heart.
