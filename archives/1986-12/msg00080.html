I have two copies of "The Golden Age Of Wireless" - The first was released
before "Blinded By Science" was released and features the songs "Leipzig"(sp?)
and Urges (featuring percussion by Andy Partridge).  It does not contain
either "One Of Our Submarines" or "Blinded By Science".  The cover is a
photo of dolby in what seems like a temple of arcane scientific artifacts.
This album was the first one released (as far as I know).  Later, when BBS
became a big hit (it was originally released on a 5 song EP, as I recall),
a new version of the album was released minus "Leipzig" and "Urges" but with
BBS and "One Of Our Submarines".  It also features the 'magazine' cover.
The only alternate versions that I know of are those on the EP which, I
believe, are different.  I see all three records from time to time used, and
I think the canadian pressing of the LP is the same as the first domestic
one - I'm not sure though...
     Attention David Sylvian fans : The new D.S. single is out, featuring
Robert Fripp and Bill Nelson as well as Sylvian himself.  It's called
"Taking The Veil" and is on 7" and 12".  It doesn't blow me away yet, but
it's growing on me with every listen...
     Also check out the new The The single, "Heartland".  It's less funky
than "Sweet Bird Of Truth" (which featured Anna Domino on backing vocals,
BTW), and more of a sort of return to "Soul Mining" territory but I already
love it!  Matt Johnson forever!
