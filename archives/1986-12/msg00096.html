     Have any decisions been made about the KT-shirt?  I suggest we collect all
those ideas together and vote, so that we might further its production.  (I'm
not sure of this, but it looked like a majority favored the net address idea,
along with *something* from The Dreaming.)  I'd be more than happy to assemble
all the old ideas, and any last-minute new ones, into a single list, so that
everyone who's interested in investing in our KT-wear, can assist in the design
decision.  I can create the list, send it out to make sure we haven't forgotten
anyone's ideas, then send out a new list (if neccessary), and eveyone can vote.
Sound okay to everybody, or have I just been asleep while this was already
done?
     Just out of curiousity, what was everyone's reaction to Big Country's
The Seer?  I quite like their sound, and am especially impressed with Kate's
part in the title track.  Has she done session work with artists other than
Big Country and Gabriel?  Incidently, I thought her part in Gabriel's "Don't
Give Up" was the highlight of So.  Someone told me the other day that he'd
really like to see Kate do a project like Gabriel's Birdy.  I definitely agree,
though I think she'd have to include a few more vocals, and bastardize more
material from The Dreaming than anywhere else.
     Thought I'd get everyone's reaction to my KTop-five list (which is
constantly changing):

     1st and foremost       Get Out Of My House
     2nd  (We have a tie.)  The rest of The Dreaming  (Yes, I really like this
                            album.)
     3rd                    Under The Ivy
     4th                    Watching You Without Me
     5th                    Oh To Be In Love

There.  Please try not to be too hostile if you stongly disagree.  And what's
this?  Nothing off of Lionheart, or Never For Ever?  Hey, I'm still crazy about
those albums too.
