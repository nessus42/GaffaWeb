<PRE>
To Peter: Head Over Heels (including Sunburst and Snowblind)
has already come out on CD -- IED found a copy last week at Rene's
All Ears in West Hollywood, and saw another at Rhino Records
in Westwood the same day, gone the next; but probably to
be seen around soon in plentiful supply, judging from the
stack of Garlands and Victorialand now in Tower Sunset's bins.

For Thomas Dolby fans, IED assumes you are familiar with
the Low Noise 12" of "Jungle Line" -- a cover version of
Joni Mitchell's song from Hissing of Summer Lawns, which
is backed with "Urban Tribal", an early low-key track
in the style of "Leipzig", "Urges" and "Therapy/Growth".
Are you, however, also familiar with the first two
Trevor Herion singles, "Dream Soldiers" and "Wonderlust"?
Both written and produced by Dolby, during the (good old)
Wireless period? And of course "New Toy". This is about the
extent of IED's knowledge of non-hits Dolby, but this is no
great loss, as the recent "Howard the Duck" drek demonstrates
better than words. You have also already figured out that
"Ms. Sakamoto" is Akiko Yano, who guested on "Radio Silence"?
IED changes the subject now, fully expecting deserved upbraiding
for relaying well-known TD trivia.

IED wants to emend his statement that the establishment of
"serious Kate fan" status be a prerequisite
for attending the West Coast premiere of
Love-Hounds' live act. This was intolerant. Anyone prepared
to watch poor-quality bootleg videotape of a British pop star
for many hours, surrounded by eccentric enthusiasts
who study her every living action, is welcome, whether similarly
disposed or not.
Concerning the party, the tentative date is Sunday, August 30th.
This is because Saturday is the first opportunity IED will have
to prepare the venue's house for an onslaught of fanatics,
and September is perilously close to some people's school plans.
If by chance the first weekend in September is NOT inconvenient,
however, please let this be known.

By the way, anyone with what he thinks is obscure KT video
or other lionhearted ephemera -- please bring it along.
There are two items from which the evening in question
could benefit: a VHS VCR (although one will be rented
if none is volunteered for the evening), and a Laser video-disc
player (stereo, if such a distinction is applicable in that
medium), on which latter instrument might be played the two
video discs (already in the host's possession), for the sake
of newcomers to the KulT.

The party will be at 10499 Wilkins Avenue, which is in West Los
Angeles, not far from the UCLA campus. It occupies a spacious
Spanish villa-style house in the quadrant defined by
Wilshire, Beverly Glen, Santa Monica and Westwood Boulevards;
and is accessible by traveling north from Santa Monica Blvd
on Thayer Avenue, or south from Wilshire on Thayer, or
southwest from the UCLA campus on Warner Avenue. If this
is still not clear please inquire further.

Is Allen (sp?) Watson III out there somewhere? IED, for one, read with
fascination his exquisitely polished essay on chord progressions
in Kate's music (in BT 10), from which much was learned, and much more
curiosity aroused.

Speaking of polished and thought-provoking essays, thanks from IED
to Gregory for his wise and convincing appeals for toleration. And
he's right to push for further analysis of Christian (and other
religious) referents in KT: much is there, doubtless not all of it
conscious.

Oh, speaking of Kate, has anyone got his or her copy of
"Cathy" from Jay yet? IED is getting impatient!
