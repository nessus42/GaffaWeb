Between reading the comments of L-H people and reading the reviews of SO in
some of my more trusting places (e.g. Keyboard, Modern Recording, etc), I
managed to not buy (or listen to sans Sledgehammer) PG #5.  Well I picked
up the cassette in Montreal Wed and I havent played much else in my car
since.  I feel that, by far, theis is Gabriel's best solo work to date.
For the same reasons I am starting to enjoy Lionheart and Never For Ever
much more than HoL, I find I like So.  Many people have claimed that
PGIII is the PGs of all PGs.  Well, in much the same way that The Dreaming
is probably Kate's most interesting work to date, there does seem to be
room, even in a single artist's writings, for enough variance to put together
a consistent product which probably appeals to two entirely seperate
subgroups of music lovers.  This is what I find in So.
As for the claims that this is a commercial 'Sell-Out' album (based, I would
have to supose on Sledgehammer alone, since I don't see much commercial
Hit potential for anything else on the album except for, maybe, Don't Give
Up, which with a convincing video become a a smash tearjerker ala Time
After Time), I obviously see no indications of this.  What I do hear is
a welcome return to the Lamb Lies Down era Genesis phrasing in Gabriel's
style which was missing from all but PGI (Sollsbury Hill in particular).
The mere lack of the Keyboard influence of Larry Fast with the substitution
of Gabriel's own style on the keyboards surely must add to the effect.
I would have loved this to have been PGI instead of PGV.  In truth, I do
like PGIII a lot, but I like experimental things quite a bit.  So hits that
other side of my musical tastes, with its reliable rhythmic romps through
melodically tasteful passages.  I also like occassionally to listen to
lyrics that remain poetic and contain no discernable alternate message
which is hiding in rough symbolism (Sledgehammer is, of course, a comic
exception to that last statement.  That Voice Again, In Your Eyes, We do
What Were told and especially the Thid id the Picture duet with Laurie
Anderson are examples of the flowing Gabriel I've missed since Genesis.  To
even mention this LP in the same sentence with any of Phil Collins albums
does it a diservice.
As for the Don't Give Up debate.  Kate does an appreciable job singing lyrics
which were written by PG in a melody composed by PG.  I don't see any
special relevance for her role in the LP, however and I think her inclusion
in Games Without Frontiers was much more appropriate.  I really can't see
Dolly Parton doing that vocal although I think I would have chosen somebody
other than Kate, if it were my choice (Melanie would be my first choice and
? Oldfield who does work with Mike Oldfield and did the memorable vocal
on Voyage of the Acolyte, second).  I just guess I see a place for this
sentimental type of thing, especially from Peter Gabriel who brought us
to know and understand Rael in a similar manner.
At any rate, now that he's satisfied my interests with the album I've been
waiting for, for all I care he can go back to Shocking Monkeys, bizarre
rhythms, and Larry Fast effects for PGVI.  If there is any deep meaning
in the album, it must be in the title.
