(Where is everyone -- on vacation?  The last two digests have been tinytiny)
(Grrr ... eddie.mit.edu tossed this message back so I'm going to send it
 again, so disregard the above because there's lots o'stuff coming now.)


Well, everyone's favorite album of doom, gloom, tortured guitars, and
Elizabeth Fraser is now available in glorious digital (well AAD anyway) --

Cocteau Twins "Garlands"  4AD Records  CAD 211 CD

And a good deal it is too; along with the usual eight songs it also contains:

	Dear Heart
	Hazel
	Hearsay Please
	Blind Dumb Deaf
...taken from a January 1983 John Peel radio session.  These four were
previously on the B-side of the "Garlands" cassette.  "Dear Heart" and "Hearsay
Please" aren't on any vinyl, and the former stands among their best early
songs.  "Hazel" is a b-side of "Peppermint Pig", but is quite a bit different
here; both it and "Dear Heart" have additional vocals by Gordon Sharp.
"Blind Dumb Deaf" is somewhat different from the "Garlands" version, but not
much, and it's one of my least favorite CTwins songs, anyway (not that I don't
like it).

And!
	Speak No Evil
	Maybe Some Other Aeon
Never before available, as far as I know.  "Speak No Evil" is very slow and
ominous and I love it.  "Maybe..." is good, but not great.

Anyway, you get 14 songs, 57 minutes of listening terror, for your $15 (what
I paid at Poo Bah), plus a complete lyric sheet.  Good deal!  Buy Buy Buy!

This leaves "Head Over Heels" (my favorite) as the only LP not yet on disc.
They will certainly tack "Sunburst and Snowblind" onto it, but where does
that leave "Lullabies" and "Peppermint Pig"?  Hnurp.

(PS: Well yeah, I was only kidding about
     the lyric sheet)
