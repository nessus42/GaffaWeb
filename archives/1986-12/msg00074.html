&gt; Parler quoi?  Moi, have a dirty mind???  Actually, I can hear it
&gt; either way.  In fact, I told Mr. Turner that.  I never even thought
&gt; about what it said until a large bunch of friends of mine insisted to
&gt; me that it says "Listen to me come, baby".  The thing is, that makes
&gt; perfect sense, and "Listen to me tell them, baby" doesn't make much
&gt; sense at all.  Of course, it could also, as IED maintains be "Listen
&gt; to me!  Come, baby!"

Nanda o? (since we're getting into languages here) You firmly stated that
that was what you thought it was! I will not be made a mockery of (though,
it would be REAL easy) ! I firmly stand behind Shelli's appraisal. You got
a dirty mind, friend!

Enough of this...

Someone told me I've been ripped of by buying "Lamb" for $40. Considering
it's an import, it's two discs, they're selling out faster than any disc this
month, and I've not seen them anywhere else in Boston or in any CD catalog
(even foriegn CD catalogs). So I was a stupid fool and paid $40 for it. So
what? Ya only live once, right... (and it sounds, as I predicted, FUCKING
INCREDIBLE!)

To answer Shelli's question :

Me:     [observing John Rossi climbing into Doug's kitchen looking pale] Uh,
	had a bit much to drink, have we?
John: 	Yeah...
Me:	Are we going to be sick?
John:	...just was. Where's the bathroom?

I took him at his word...

By the way, my contributions may be getting delayed for some reason here at
UMB. Please excuse me if I am a little behind...

Some Rock-and-roll Excuses for All Occasions:
	#13: Of course I remember you.
	#17: If only the album had come out sooner.
	#30: He said it's in heavy rotation.
	#32: Of course they'll do interviews.
	#33: Our set never runs over.
	#36: The hall sounds a lot better when the kids are inside.
	#40: But they're huge in England.
	#45: He swore he'd bring the limo back in 5 minutes.
