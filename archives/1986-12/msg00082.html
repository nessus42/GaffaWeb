  T     Well, it was on last night. IED finally got       T
  E     a really good version of "RUTH" off MTV, that     E
  K     loathsome scourge of popular anti-culture, that   K
  A     Foul Blot on the Landscape of Art.                A
  T     Its abominable, simpering "Quinn" character       T
  E     once again repeated knowingly that Kate was       E
  K     "discovered" by David Gilmour. At this point,     K
  A     ten years after the fact, that's about as         A
  T     silly as introducing the Beatles to an            T
  E     audience in 1969 thus: "Please welcome            E
  K     The Beatles, who were discovered                  K
  A     by Brian Epstein!"                                A

        D    The "Running Up That Hill" film      U
        E    is fraught with NARRATIVE details;   T
        R    has everyone else already            H
        I    realized that? Also, with the        E
        C    inferior copy I had before, I        L
        E    had never noticed the apocalyptic    P
        S    clouds in the crucifixion scene.     M
        I    Has everyone noted the explicit      E
        L    reference to Dali, as well, in       C
        V    the God's-eye view of the cross?     O
        E    Or the male womb symbolism in the    M
        R    choreography of the first half?      E
        H                                         ?

       Regarding a West Coast Love-Hounds video party,
       IED would appreciate it if all those who are
       interested in attending could let him
       know, either through Love-Hounds, or by mail

                 {Andrew Marvick
                 10499 Wilkins Avenue
                 Los Angeles, CA 90024},

       or by telephone

                {(213) 474-5208}.

       Rest assured that this doesn't mean you aren't wanted
       if you don't RSVP -- crashers are
       accepted, providing they're serious Kate fans.
       He just wants to get a rough idea how many to expect.
       As far as he knows, there are only three or four of us out here.

     Bear in mind that Kate Bush, as the greatest living
   human being, should always be considered in the context
                of that overwhelming truth.
