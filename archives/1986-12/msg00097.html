Maybe I'm a little late on this topic, but after all this debate about what
Kate says in "Waking the Witch," I decided I would listen for myself.
Well, I don't think Kate said "Listen to me come, baby." Last night, I put
on my cd of _Hounds of Love_, put on my headphones, and put the A-B repeat
function on my cd player to good use.  I listened to those few phrases over
and over, for about twenty-five times.  I tried really hard to hear what
others have been hearing, but all I could hear was this:

	Listen to me
	Listen to me
	Tell them, baby
	Uh, help me ....

This actually make sense if you think about it -- she'd on trial, after
all.

I have a question about the Cocteau Twins.  I'm not terribly familiar with
their music, but I can recognize them when I hear them on the radio.  I
like what I have heard on the radio, but I don't know enough to go out and
buy any of their cd's.  Peter Alfke seems to really like _Garlands_.  I
know there was a pretty big discussion about CT albums a couple of months
ago, but I didn't really learn enough to convince me that a certain album
would be a good first CT album to get.  Would _Garlands_ be a good
introduction?  I heard a song yesterday on WZBC that was from
_Victorialand_.  (I think the song had something to do with April, or March
or something.)  I really liked that song - it was pretty, with acoustic
guitar, and nice vocals, and nice to listen to.  Is all of _Vict._ like
that?  Maybe that would be a good first CT album?  Please help out a
potential CT fan!  

Doug's party was fun.  (It sounds like I left too early, though.)  It's
pretty interesting to go to a party when you don't know anyone there, but
everyone has something in common.  Maybe we can get Kate to come to the
next one.  We could all chip in to pay for her airfare.  Then we could have
her perform some of her songs, and we wouldn't need to watch her videos.
