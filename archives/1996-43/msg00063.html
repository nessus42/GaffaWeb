Hi!

CraigJ posted:

&gt;You can get "Teenager" directly from Jane's website at www.sheeba.ca
&gt;It took mine quite a while to get to me (upwards of 2 months), but it was
&gt;well worth it.  I haven't seen it available elsewhere.  

_Teenager_ is now available in stores, both in the US and Canada (and I
think soon to be in Europe too).  You can still order it direct, but it's
not impossible to find retail any more.

Kelley Hays-Gilpin noted:

&gt;Finally caught up with messages from the last 2 weeks...and
&gt;OK, Meth, OK!  I sent my $12 for "Moon in Grenadine" by Emily Bezar,

Yay!

&gt;NOT because I do everything you tell me (I for one, LIKE KaTe's
&gt;cover of Lord of the Reedy River quite a lot :)).  But I do visit
&gt;Meth's website now and then to get new musical ideas...thanks M!

Oh no, the pressure... ;)

&gt;I was keeping an eye out for EB last week in shops, but of course
&gt;didn't find it--NOT AVAILABLE IN SHOPS ANYWHERE I suppose... 

That's true.  I have heard of her first album, _Grandmother's Tea Leaves_
being seen in stores known for carrying stuff by really obscure indie
artists, but those occurences have been very few and far between, alas.

I hope you like it -- please let me know what you think. :)

&gt;I'd like to point out that Meth's ravings about Susan McKeown and
&gt;the Chanting House "Bones" were right on target--one of my favorite
&gt;CDs, so when she started raving about EB, well, she could be right
&gt;again. For a different take on Mna na hEireann, much jazzier than
&gt;KaTe's version, check this out.

Yay!!!  I'll also add that _Bones_ has been reissued on the Prime-CD label,
so it should be easier to find now.  If it's not, you can get it by calling
1-800-PRIME-CD.  (And the liner notes contain the English translation of
Mna-na-hEireann, so here's another way to get it for your very own. :)

woj and I were in Northampton, MA last night to see Altan at the Iron Horse
Music Hall (yay), and beforehand we stopped by Main St. Music, which is
operated by a raving Katefan.  He's got his signed TSW poster, his signed
HoL poster, and a laminated listing of all the KaTe rariTies stuck in the
bin, since there's too many to display all at once.  We saw a copy of the
reissue of The Singles File in the case, and I think there may be a Boxed
Set lurking out back there somewhere, too.  Worth checking out if you're in
town -- it's always nice to find a place run by a KaTemaniac. :)  They get
Homeground in too.

(Oh yeah, and the owner's a rabid Toriphile too...)
