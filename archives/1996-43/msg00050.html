&gt;Then you didn't experience to horror of hearing the jury announce

&gt;In my opinoin, the Kate lookalike sucked big time. The costume-artists
&gt;made a good job, and the makeup was ok. She mimicked Kate rather good,
&gt;especially the wild-eyes look. But she sang horribly. She sang off tune
&gt;quite a few times, got the lyrics wrong a couple of times, and her voice
&gt;cracked ever so slightly every time she went for the high tones.
&gt;

I can't believe how painfully nice you are;)
Have to agree though.

&gt;The jury said to her that imitating Kate was very bold, and demanded 
&gt;lots of guts. In fact, they thought she ought to have bonus points for
&gt;trying to imitate such a difficult artist. Then, they themselves had the
&gt;guts to say that the imitating girl actually had a more mature voice
&gt;than Kate (but I guess thay said so let her down gently. They usually
&gt;are very careful in their way to say that the performance was not 
&gt;adequate...).

I gagged a couple of times when that announcement was made.

&gt;"We have choosen the winner with this motivation:
&gt;For showing great courage, and boldness in the choice of artist..."
&gt;
&gt;I just screamed out loud, almost sacring my girlfriend to death...
&gt;

A choir must have sounded through the cold wastes of Scandinavia 'cause
I certainly screamed too. Actually I hid behind the sofa (I usually
vacate that space when something is REALLY painful to watch.).

Mikael, keep up those views and Valhalla isn't far away..;)

Marcus.
