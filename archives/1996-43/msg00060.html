&gt; What's it say? What's it say?

&gt;Robb

Just that the artists performed on her albums.
But they mention her for both of them, so in 
the information, she appears *friendly* to the 
Irish folk musicians, which of course, she is.
I don't have the CD here, so I can't quote it.

I saw the U.S. ABC interview of Kate after the release of 
Sensual World.  The piece was about the Bulgarian 
singers, and she was interviewed about her role 
in using them.  She said quite earnestly that it 
hurt when critics accused her of taking advantage 
of these musicians.  The same was done to Paul 
Simon.  The musicians have expressed their intense 
gratitude for the opportunities and exposure afforded 
them by pop stars who are champions of world music.
All I know is that I would not own this wonderful 
album of the Bulgarian music had Kate not introduced 
me to it.  Fantastic harmonies.  Wish I could reproduce 
them, but not in my reach.

I'd love to contribute the interview to the tape tree, 
but it was on a tape owned by someone with whom I have 
no contact now.  She happened to get it by luck when 
she heard they were doing the piece and her intuition 
made her guess that Kate would be in it.  The interview 
was very short, but touching because Kate was very 
honest about her feelings and showed it.
