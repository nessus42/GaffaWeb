Hi all ,

Halloween night marks the opening of a brand new TV channel in 
Ireland,(that makes three !) .It is called Teilifis na Gaeilge (or 
TnaG)and will be entirely in the Irish language .One of the most 
hyped shows will be presented by Donal Lunny and will be a music 
programme called Sult (spirit of Irish music). Most of you will know 
that Donal is a very well known Irish musician and producer who has 
worked a fair bit with Kate over the years , most recently producing 
the Common Ground album.

Featured guests will include a lot of his Common Ground pals ...Elvis 
Costello, Christy Moore  etc ...and Mary Black will also be in one of 
the programmes . I know it's unlikely but I'm keeping an eye out for 
any Kate appearances ..you never know perhaps they might show the 
enhanced CD segment she's supposed to have done ?It is in Irish after 
all .....still looking forward to the show in any case !

There is a huge controversy as to whether or not we actually need to 
spend tax-payers millions on TnaG but I'm all for it .....it will 
help me to improve my spoken Irish and Scotland and Wales have had 
their versions of this type of channel for years now .

Nice to know Kate's plowing ahead on new material at the moment ....


Sean :-)
p.s. This is my first time on-line since recovering from an operation 
 and I'm glad I don't have stitches in any more since I can't believe 
how funny it is that my Skippy The Bush Kangaroo comment has caused a 
monster !I could cause another one by mentioning that I'm sure Kate 
fans would love the Australian movie Picnic At Hanging Rock ...It's 
been my favourite movie for years .....skip skip over and out !
