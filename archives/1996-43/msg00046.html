&gt;&gt; Hello All,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I had a bit of a nasty tiff with a friend of mine who _insisted_ that 
&gt;&gt; KB posed for Playboy in the late 1970's.  I say he's mistaken..am I 
&gt;&gt; right???
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;This is one of the oldest pieces of Kate-related BS in the book. 
&gt;
&gt;Here's the facts. A Canadian Magazine similar to Playboy ran a photo
&gt;spread of a model who happened to resemble (slightly, through fuzzy
&gt;lenses) Kate Bush. The photo spread was called "Kate?" as in, you be the
&gt;judge as to who this is. I forget the name of the model, but her name has
&gt;come up in here before.

   To be more exact, Penthouse magazine ran a pictoral of a model refered
to as "Kate Simmons". It was either the June or July issue of 1979. She
was supposed to bear a fair resembelance to our Kate, and they went to
pains to suggest that this was Kate *Bush*, that she was a doctor's
daughter from Kent, etc.

&gt;A few years later, Kate was asked about it--she said she'd heard about it,
&gt;never seen it, and then got very offended when a reporter asked her if
&gt;she'd ever consider doing something like that. 

   Not that she is offended by nudity per say; Lindsey Kemp's troup
often performed nude, and she said that she had considered doing
the video for _Breathing_ nude as it was a fetus but concluded that
it would "send the wrong vibe." I think we can conclude that she
believes nudity can be artistically valid, and might have been more
offended by the question as yet more of the "sex symbol" thing.

&gt;It's NOT Kate Bush. I've seen the pix (they ended up on the cover of a
&gt;Kate Bootleg in the '80s) and she looks no more like Kate Bush than I do.

   I've never seen them...but I have looked for the issue.

   "I suppose it's sexy 'cos you can see my tits..." - Kate (in reference to 
the poster for The Kick Inside)
