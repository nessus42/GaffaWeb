Tori Amos Concert Review

	I thought since I had opened my mouth/keyboard and let everyone 
out there know I was going to see Tori Amos, I'd make a few comments 
about it - fantastic, awesome, wonderful, ..... Really, it was a great 
performance and I'm pretty cynical about live concerts. It was 
interesting to me because, as I mentioned, I have heard of Tori but 
never really heard her music so my first real Tori experience was live.
(Your right R.G., I guess I have been under a rock as far as Tori goes. 
;-)) 

	The concert was last night, Wed., and she played in a medium 
size music hall with piano, harpsichord, and a guitarist, though the 
guitar playing was minimum. On one of her last songs she played a small 
organ. The hall was almost filled. Her special lighting for the show was 
well designed, not overdone, and different films to accompany the songs 
- rippling water, a rollercoaster - were played on a triangular shaped 
screen in the background. She performed about an hour and a half. She 
wore a white blouse and pants although I sat back a ways and couldn't 
see a lot of detail. No opera glasses.

	I was very impressed by her music and kept thinking shes the 
American version of Kate Bush. IMO she has a definite Kate influence. It 
was very obvious in her sound but she also has a style of her own and I 
know this is nothing you Tori fans don't already know and discuss but 
shes new to me. She has very beautiful music but I'd say its 'harder 
edged' than Kates. One thing I had difficulty with, and I don't mean 
this as criticism, but during her first song, I thought she was speaking 
partly in a language other than English. Then I realized it was her 
pronounciation/enunciation that I was hearing. I still could only 
understand about half of what she was saying and straining my ears, (the 
sound system was excellent), so she has a unique vocal style. I just 
wanted to understand more of what her lyrics were about. I wish I was 
familiar with her songs and I could tell you exactly the ones she 
performed. She spoke to the audience a little and told one or two 
anctedotes about herself.

	Though Tori was great and I'll be listening to her more, shes 
not at Kates level, who could be, but I think shes the next best thing 
to seeing Kate live. Comments and criticisms welcome. If there can be a 
Skippy the Bush Kangaroo dialog going on here, hopefully nobody will 
mind this little Tori diversion ;-).

Whats the best Tori site to check out on the Internet??
