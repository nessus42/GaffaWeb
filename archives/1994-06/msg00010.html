    Even as I type this, NASA is conducting a series of bizarre
experiments involving well known pop-star Tori Amos. If they succeed,
these experiments will enable NASA to make several manned missions a year
into low earth orbit using Tori Amos as the launch vehicle!! Naturally,
NASA are keeping quite about this in an attempt to suppress bad publicity,
but concrete evidence proving that Tori Amos is indeed a shuttle type
launch vehicle can be found on the front of her 'Under the Pink' album. 

	I made this discovery on the evening of Saturday 5th February 1994
whilst enjoying a few drinks at a friend's house. Another friend just
happened to have with her a copy of the album mentioned above (CD
version). I glimpsed at the album out of the corner of my eye, and
noticed that on the front was a picture of a space shuttle launch!! 
Obviously I was shocked, especially since only minutes earlier, I had
looked at the front of the album and found a picture of Tori Amos in a long
white dress. Initially I blamed it on all the beer I had consumed, but the
next day I examined the album again and found that the picture of the
space shuttle launch was still there!! 
	You too can make this disturbing discovery if you just follow the
instructions below. You will need a copy of the 'Under the Pink' album -
the CD version. 

	1. Take the CD case and look at the front, you will notice a
picture of Tori Amos in a long white dress in front of a light blue
background. On the floor is a pile of white material (I think). 

	2. Now rotate the CD case sideways so that you are looking at the
edge of the case, making sure that the picture of Tori Amos is still the
right way up. 

	3. Now *slowly* turn the front of the case towards you so that you
can just see the picture of Tori, but not so far that you can actually
recognise who she is. 

	4. If you look carefully, you'll notice that Tori's dress now
looks more like the exhaust plume of the shuttle and that her red hair has
now become the main fuel tank. Her face now resembles the shuttle itself. 

	If you don't believe me, try it yourself. It is possible that the
American version of the album has a different cover, this could mean that
some people reading this will be unable to recreate this amazing
experiment. If this is the case, then I can only say I'm sorry. It would
be great if everyone could help bring this conspiracy out into the open. 
	If you too can confirm this discovery, then please either follow
up this message with a confirmation or E-mail me.
