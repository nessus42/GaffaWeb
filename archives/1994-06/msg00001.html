Promotion wouldn't hurt but I don't expect that of an artist.  That
should primarily be the job of the record company.  Unfortunately a
lot of the burden is placed on the artist these days.

I hate most all of MTV except 120 Minutes, which I have on now (they
are idiots for having it on so late [1am here]).  As sad as it may
seem, until the recent NPR radio interview, I think the only place
someone in Tucson could hear new (any?) Kate Bush was MTV.  There are
a couple alternative radio shows, but when I tuned in to one two weeks
ago they played Sarah McLachlan and said "no news on an album as yet.
We'll keep you posted as always".  Yeah, right.  (It's possible Kate
has been played on one of the local "alternative" shows, but I gave up
on local radio a while ago.)  The point is that local radio here is no
better than MTV, and MTV seems to have promoted Kate more than
anything else here.
