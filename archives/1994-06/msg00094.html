: "All the drum  sounds  on  the  record

: of the  drumsticks  hitting  the  pads.
: We  used  samples  because  our  studio

    techniques

: practically  mixed  itself.  The  sounds
: on tape were  good,  so  he  just  added

:  "Kate  really  doesn't  like   to   use
: samples    or    sequences,"     reveals
: Palmer.  "Everything  on   the   record-
: except  a  few  drum   loops-is   played
: real-time.  We   definitely   wanted   a
: band feel, so  we  didn't  get  obsessed
: with technology.  I  just  twisted  knobs
: until things sounded good."

Does this make sense? The album is more organic
because the drum loops that everything wa built
on were overdubbed by a live drummer playing
an electronic kit? Del Palmer's idea of a band
feel is a drummer playing over loops. Right.

This has got to be the reason for my big problem
with Kate's otherwise excellent output - everything
sounds too artificial and mechanical, especially
on the last couple of albums. I think Kate and Del
have been assembling music instead of playing it
for so long that they've forgotten what a band
sounds like.

And the recorded sound that Del is so impressed
with sounds like shit.
