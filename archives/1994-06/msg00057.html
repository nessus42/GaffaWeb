there are also be dates to be added down the west coast which will happen
right after the vancouver show, but nothing is completely confirmed yet. so
chill.

our friend sarah has also been nominated for two juno awards. for y'all from
the south side of the border, the junos are the canadian equivalent of the
grammy awards. only for canadians, which generally excludes bryan adams.
sarah's two nominations are for best female vocalist and for songwriter of
the year. in 1991 sarah won a juno for best video for 'into the fire.'

we've been selling tickets at the nettwerk office for the bellingham shows.
if you are interested, give me a call at 604 654 2929. not sure how much
longer they will last, but if you're in the area and want to go, we're the
only canadian outlet.

a couple of enterprising sarah fans (stacey and andrew) have put together a
sarah mail reflector list. i haven't seen how busy it is yet, but i know that
they are quite proud of it. you can email them at 'fte@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au'
or subscribe  by emailing 'fte-request@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au'

oh, i almost forgot, if any of you have a large chunk of disposable income,
sarah is selling her graham gilmore painting that was on the inside sleeve of
FTE. but big pieces of artwork carry prices that aren't for the faint of
(he)art. (boo, hiss).

jay also has some sarah info to share, but it's in the bbs section, so read
on.

just a few more sleeps until 'fumbling toward ecstasy' hits the streets in
the states.

chronicles of rose
==================

wow, has 'shiver' ever taken off! i mean we expected it to do well, but i
think we are all kind of floored by the response that rose chronicles debut
album has received. it's moving up the american college charts (CMJ - top 40)
and it has even entered the canadian retail charts, something unheard of for
a debut release from a little known indie band from the west coast.

the official record release show is february 12 at the town pump in
vancouver, with a big march date at the vancouver east cultural centre.
touring possibilities are being discussed.

the nettwerk garage sale
========================

yes, these now near legendary events are continuing...the story on this for
garage sale neubies is that we turn the nettwerk abode into kinda flea market
where we sell all our stuff from cd's and cassettes to posters and shirts for
KRAAAAAAZZZZZZZYY prices. we're going to try to dig this time and find some
really rare stuff as well as a bunch of vinyl that hasn't seen the light of
day in a few years. in addition, this time the multi-talented nettwerk staff
will be holding a bake sale with all proceeds of our baking going to women
against violence against women (wavaw) in vancouver. the sale is on saturday,
february 26 and goes from noon until 5pm. ric will also be on hand to make
cappuccinos. he's good. slow, but good.

BBS Type stuff (a guest appearance by jay)
==========================================

You'll notice a dramatic style change now. It's not often I get to speak up,
probably with good reason. The BBS is plugging along, minor improvements here
and there. The big news is we finally are hooked up to the Internet. More or
less.

I have set up a "true" Internet mailing list. It works like any other list
server. You send mail to subscribe, people send mail to it, you send mail to
it and everyone gets everyone's messages. If you get too much mail and are
unhappy you unsubscribe. (note from lane: this is the same thing as the sarah
mailing list that i mentioned earlier)

To subscribe to the Nettwerk Mailing list: Send mail to
"nettlist-request@nettwerk.wimsey.com" with the word "SUBSCRIBE anywhere in
the message text body.

To send mail to the Nettwerk Mailing list: Send your message to
nettlist@nettwerk.wimsey.com and your message will be sent to everyone else.

To unsubscribe from the Nettwerk Mailing list: Send your message to
nettlist@nettwerk.wimsey.com with the word UNSUBSCRIBE anywhere in the
message body.

And no, I don't have the digest feature. But you can expect the messages in
bursts every 24 hours or so. The mailing list will be carried as a discussion
group on the BBS, so expect to see more Nettwerk artists and staff posting.
Lane will continue to run the Nettwerk Newsletter Mailing List seperately.

I am going to add the ftp by mail feature in the next week or two, I'll let
you know. Between then and now all our BBS files are mirrored over at
ftp.uwp.edu. Just type "cd nettwerk" once you're there, "nettwerk.idx" is
text file containing all the file descriptions. Thanks to Dave Datta!

And in the Sarah catagory. Sarah McLachlan will be in our CHAT area on the
Nettwerk BBS. This will be on Feb.20 @ 5PM PST for an hour or maybe more
depending on Sarah's schedule. Each call will be allowed 10 minutes on the
BBS. You can call the BBS at (604) 731-7007 or 1-800-668-1321. I know some of
you are saying "Why not a IRC or Compu$ or something?!". Well, this is just a
trial at this sort of thing and you can call the 1-800.

I'm really busy on lots and lots more stuff for the coming year. Cool stuff,
honest. So please be patient with me. Sometimes working with computers can be
a slow and painful Process. But most of the time it's just silly and fun.

upcoming release schedule

housekeeping
============

we're getting close to 500 people on our little newsletter list. it looks
like it will generally be every two weeks or so, as i tend to write in
bursts. if anyone you know wants to subscribe to the newsletter mailing list,
just have them drop me a note at 'nettwerk@mindlink.bc.ca', and if you are
tired of hearing from me or are moving or just don't want to get this
anymore, just say so. no hard feelings. really.

thanks to all who have been writing over the past couple of weeks. special
thanks to melody who has taken over the sarah discography for the bbs (i'll
have it available for mailing in a week or so, i would suspect) and also to
stacey and andrew for their work on the sarah mailing list. hope it's going
well. see you all in a couple of weeks, and if you have any questions in the
meantime, i'm always attached to my keyboard.

Lane your weary, but wide eyed email friend of little brain.
