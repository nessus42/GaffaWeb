Greetings, All! This is my first post on rec.music.gaffa (or on any
usenet message base for that matter).
I hope this method of posting works, as no other (short of hacking out a
password on another univeristy's computer) does.

Just wanted to say first of all, that if I recall, the soundtrack to Blade
Runner by Vangelis was referred to in the closing credits as "harp of the
ancient temples" or some such name. I've never been able to find a track
or a record of that name. However, there is a CD which is available in
Canada which contains the music which was played during the movie (including
the closing credits piece) most of the tracks on this CD are by Vangelis.

Seconly, a big hit on the head with the heel of my hand regarding the record
bootlegs. I am orignially from Cambridge, MA and at Second Coming Records
and at this other place near Boston Univeristy there were lots of times when
I would see two-record sets of Kate Bush containing most of the same stuff
but always with different names and covers. They piked my interest because
of the photography on the record covers (one of them was a NUDE portfolio
of Kate Bush!!! Of the quality of spreads in Playboy! seriously!!). I had
no idea they were bootlegs but everything fits now... I would have been
very surprised if it was actually the case that KT willingly put 10 pictures
of herself nude on the record jacket of one of HER releases.....

And now, another editorial comment: The SENSUAL world??? Gag, Barf, Ack!!!
(this is in aggreement)..............

Also, for all you northeast coasters who wanted to know about the Cure tour,
they are going to be in Montreal at the Forum (y'know ! Where the Bruins kicked
ass year-before-last) on August 24th

And now, for some new music discoveries: Any of you hear of a new group
called Bel Canto? They have an album out on Capitol's Nettwerk label
(crammed disks) and anyone who likes Kate Bush will love these folks!!!

Also (this is my last also) is anyone out there into the Clan of Xymox
(now known simply as just-plain XYMOX??)

Depeche Modem, signing off...
