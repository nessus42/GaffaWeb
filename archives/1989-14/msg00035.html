To the moderator:  I tried sending this message once before
but I think it got lost.  If you get it but decide not to use
it, please send me a mail message saying so.  I'm still not
certain that my mail routine is working perfectly.


Here is my submission for rec.music.gaffa:

In the latest issue of DISCoveries magazine (August, 1989),
the following letter appears:

          LET'S GET ON THE BUSH BANDWAGON
                 I'm sure you've heard it before, but on the
          off chance that someone has not beat me to it, how
          about a cover story on Kate Bush?  As you well know,
          she is an eminently collectible artist (The most
          collectible female artist?), she has legions of fans
          around the world (probably as rabid as Elvis fans, if
          not more so due to the scarcity of news and items),
          and her gorgeous visage on your cover would sell 
          millions of copies the world over.  And if you don't,
          thousands of her fans will converge on the DISCoveries
          home office chanting rude things and generally making
          a nuisance of ourselves.
                 And I must say I was disappointed in Steve Pimper
          for not including at least one of the many gorgeous 
          picture sleeves Kate has produced in his column Slix Pix.
          If he could include Cyndi Lauper (who on her best day
          cannot approach the beauty and talent of Kate on her
          worst), he could certainly have one on Kate.  Flog him
          like the family mule.
                 You're doing a great job, guys, and keep it up!
          I'll keep on buying DISCoveries even if you don't do
          a feature on Kate, although I'll hold it against you
          forever.
                                          Geoffrey A. Shrieves
                                          Richmond, VA

The Editor replies:

          Dear Geoffrey:
                 Call off the dogs!  I'm convinced!  Now, who's
          going to do the story?  We promise to run it if one of
          you Bush maniacs works it up.  I can hardly wait to have
          an issue sell "millions of copies."  Thanks for writing.

I'm sure there must be someone who reads this newsgroup who is
knowledgeable enough and literate enough to write a good article
about Kate.  It might even get the cover!
