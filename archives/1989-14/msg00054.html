hello love-hounds, on this monday afternoon of july 31st.

i'm feeling all sad and nostalgic now that katemas is past
(and what a good one--thanks lovehounds, youknowwhoyouare).
like when i was a kid, and felt depressed the day after christmas.  
sigh.  (apologies to jon drukman for expressing these softer emotions, 
but this is usenet, not art.  :-)   )

first of all, manymanythanks to everyone who attended the west-coast
katemas &amp; contributed your own, unique brand of kate-fanism.  and
ofcourse i _must_ extend _special_ thanks to ied for making the journey,
and bringing his amazing, unbelievable, incredible, collection 
of kate "junk".  you outdid yourself, andy.  it was as if a clothesline 
laden with freshly washed clothes fell onto the ground in a giant pile, 
only to be instantly attacked by a litter of puppies eagerly snatching
brightly colored bits of cloth, and happily scattering them
about the yard.  and the nationwide phonecalls, and synchronized
singing of "happy birthday" with the north-west KonTigenT!   and
talking to |&gt;oug on a real telephone, and getting the real story 
on the origin of his foofy "|&gt;".   (btw |&gt;oug, you musn't work so hard--
your presense is sorely missed.)  sigh.  what a soujourn.

and for those of you who haven't had the pleasure of meeting ied's
alter ego, andrew marvick, here's the scoop:  he's really a very
gentle, friendly, generous, and extremely amiable fellow.  it's
true, folks.  sort of like the ghandi of kate-dom--his only aim
is to serve:  
you wanna' wear some of his kate buttons?  
  certainly!  
you want to put up all his posters?  
  but ofcourse!
they fall down repeatedly?  
  no problem, really.  
you want another interview tape before the next video?  
  sounds good.
you want to see the vegetarian cookery interview in kate's backyard 
again?
  oh yes, it's so cool!

he even READ US SHORT STORIES, WRITTEN BY KATE!!!!!
need i say more??

so see you all next year, if not before (at the pre-concert
gathering in west l.a.).
