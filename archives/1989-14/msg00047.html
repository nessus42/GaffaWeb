net -- I often go weeks without hearing her on the radio.  I do travel
around the country a fair amount, so I would like to know what other 
stations there are out there that play her.

Of course,  I may just be in a good mood because this has been a fantastic
week for Kate on the radio.  In the last eight days I've heard her
six times!  Here's what was played, with comments if appropriate.

The two stations that I know play her are KITS San Francisco, a commercial
"modern rock" station similar to KROQ down in L.A., and KFJC, the radio
station of Foothill Community College in Los Altos Hills.

Here's the log:

Sunday, Jul. 23, 9:10 am:  RUTH
   "     "    "  2:10 pm:  Wuthering Heights (new vocal)
       That Sunday was an "all-request Sunday', so both songs were by
       request. After W.H., the D.J. said "There's more evidence that
       our listeners have the greatest taste."
       (These were on KITS, by the way.  I forgot to say that.)
Monday, Jul. 24, 9:15 am:  W.H. (n.v.)  on KFJC
       The D.J. said "Here's something from _The Whole Story_, which
       is sort of her greatest hits  -- although she really doesn't
       have any greatest hits; all her songs are great.
Saturday, Jul. 29, 7:15 pm:  W.H. (n.v.) on KITS
       This again was an all-request show.  The D.J. mentioned that
       Kate has a new album coming out.  (I cannot tell a lie;  I gave
       her that news about a week ago.)
Monday, Jul. 31 (that's today!),  9:50 am:  "Babooshka" on KFJC
  "      "   "  10:15 am (less than a half hour after the above!):
       "Cloudbusting" on KITS. This was played as part of what's the
       connection, a contest the station has every weekday morning.
       Three songs suggested by a listener are played, and callers 
       have to figure out the connection.  As I said, "Cloudbusting
       " was played, and I forget what the other two songs were.
       The connection was obvious, however:  rain.
            This was the first time I ever heard that song on the 
       radio, so I called up the D.J. (Mark Hamilton) to thank him
       for playing it.  I told him that I'd not heard it before, and
       he said, "Hey, you should listen to the morning show more often.
       Yeah, I *love* Kate Bush!  She's coming out with a new album, have
       you heard?"
            "Yeah, I've heard,"  I said.
