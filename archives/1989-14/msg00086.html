hi I am a new user to newsnet. I have no idea if this message will get posted
in rec.music.gaffa or not, but anyway, here goes:

First of all, Happy KateMas to everyone!

Second of all, in response to the Pink Floyd Discussion (re: Pink gets
caught in an infinite loop), the first time I saw the movie I was
always getting confused between old pink and pink's father, and his
mother and his girlfriend.  For a while I thought it was always
following the lives of one person, and until I saw it the second time
and spent a couple of hours in contemplation afterwards did I finally
get everything straight.  You see, Pink was following in similar
footsteps to his father. They both were soldiers, anyway.  Perhaps we
are to interpret it as "like father, like son"....

     [ It is common to partake in drug consumption while viewing *The
       Wall* movie.  However, really, Sam, you shouldn't let them
       interfere with your interpretive facilities.  -- |&gt;oug ]

Anyway, I am calling from McGill where we don't have the message base
moderated. Not that it matters since we can't post from here anyway.
And I also can use an account on phoenix.princeton.edu for posting but
it is moderated there too, so if someone can tell me what is going on,
I'd appreciate it.

PS: For people up in the northeast, The Cure is playing at the Montreal
Forum (y'know - where the Montreal Canadiens (Habs) kick everyone's ass
during the winter season) around August 24th (I think).

By the way, is anyone into the Clan of Xymox? These guys are my
favorite group.. I just saw them perform live last month and they were
spectacular.  (By the way, Clan of Xymox is now known simply as Xymox
since they released their new album, Twist of Shadows).
