I saw the World Music Awards on television last night. Tragic. How all 
those sad people could benefit from a good dose of Kate, instead of ages 
of listening to dreadful modern dance music and the so-called "King of 
Pop", Michael Jackson. Really, he seems to think 'talent' is walking 
around on stage like the robot from "Buck Rogers" (Twiki?). If they want 
true talent (okay so he has sold millions of copies of "Thriller", but 
who cares? It doesn't have the same amount of innovation as TD or HOL) 
then they should, at worst, watch the Hammersmith Odeon video, or even 
better, if all Kate fans bought several copies of one of her albums 
within a single year she would qualify for a performance on these awards, 
and then she could treat them all to a wonderful version of RUTH, like 
the Amnesty International version. Then the world would hear what truly 
innovative music is. I am sooooooo angry that to qualify for the 
'talented' bracket in music these people simply have to sell the most 
records. Also, how tragic the sight of all those poor children 
worshipping Jackson was. I mean, we all love Kate, but I doubt we'd all 
scream just because she said 'I love you all'. No, I believe that (most) 
Kate fans have good manners. After all, in her live performances (well, 
okay they could be edited) there aren't many screams from the crowd 
drowning out the wonderful music. It is a mark of respect that her fans 
listen patiently and give the applause due after she has finished. Sorry 
about all that, but I am really annoyed at the state of the music 
industry, and how it gives people who are incredibly successful 
(deservedly so or not) an excuse to behave in strange ways and for their 
eccentric behaviour to be dismissed simply because the music press tells 
us these people have 'talent'.

PS. Does anybody else think Peter Gabriel looked ill when he was 
presenting an award? I hope he isn't ill.

Alan.
