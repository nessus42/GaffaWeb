&gt; But you and others assume *wrongly* that Tori is trying
&gt; to imitate Kate. She's not. She can't win with you
&gt; people. If she doesn't mention Kate she's considered
&gt; a rip-off artist who refuses to cite influences. If she
&gt; mentions how much she admires Kate then she's considered
&gt; an imitator.
&gt; 
&gt; Long ago, I came to the conclusion that Tori's just a
&gt; personal problem with you Tori bashers. You don't like
&gt; her, which is fine, but you, for some unknown reason,
&gt; feel you have to drag Kate into it, which makes no
&gt; sense to me. They're as different as night and day,
&gt; except that they both play piano and they're both of
&gt; the same gender.
&gt;

&gt; (ps, of *course* Kate is God...was there any doubt?)
&gt; 

My problem isn't with Ms. Amos per se.  I think it obvious that she's 
been influenced by Kate, whether directly or indirectly.  The thing that 
bothers me most is that (and perhaps this is sour grapes) 1&gt; Amos gets 
radio airplay; 2) People have heard of her.  I know a lot of people that 
 have heard and really like Amost, but has never heard of Kate until I 
introduced her to them.

Moreover, upon hearing both  of them, all I ever hear is, "Oh yeah.  
They're very similar."  Aside from being women, singing in the soprano 
range and playing the piano, I think there are very few  simialrities.  
I find it annoying that others (my friends in most cases) can't hear 
what I hear in Kate's music.

Again, mostly sour grapes.

Cheers,
