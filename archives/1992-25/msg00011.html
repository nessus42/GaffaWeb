No she's not doing an ad or anything like that this is just my late night 
musings of certain events while recupertaing from Caesar's "rambling" 
about Ariovistus.
  It all started a couple of years back on a rather stormy winter night. 
(I know this starts off like a bad novel) I was driving home on Navajo 
Rd. Let me describe what type of road this is: on the left hand side is a 
high cement wall separating on-coming traffic, on the right is a cliff 
drop-off. Well, as I was zipping down the road humming along to the Jig 
of Life (eery now that I think about it) it suddenly dawned on me that I 
should NOT be looking straight into someone's headlights. A few quick 
movements made easy by the adrenelin rush and I was able to squeak past 
the cadillac and it's octagenarian driver without careening over the 
edge. At the time I thought nothign about Kate being on my cassette 
player UNTIL....I also avoided the side swipe of a spastic blonde 
teenager on Interstate 8, while Kate played. Or the times I've passed a 
CHP going oh about 75mph (if my mother asks I never speed) and not 
received a speeding ticket --- Kate played on. Now one would think this 
is mere coincidence since "Kate's always in my car." But the one time I 
did receive a speeding ticket Kate was nowhere to be heard....or the man 
and his incredibely "windowless" pick-up (either that or his neck lacked 
the property of movement) that thought reversing into my front fender was 
nothing to be concerned about; again Kate was silent. If none of this 
convinces you that Kate is conducive to highway safety, the next time you 
find yourself in rush hour traffic pop in a KaTe KasseTTe and you'll find 
the grip on your shot gun loosen as enjoyment fills the cabin; in fact 
you may find yourself purposefully missing your exit just so you can sit 
a little longer and listen to Kate.
                     Kateness,
                            Lionheart
P.S&gt;
  Convoluted sentences that make absolutely no sense are not my fault but 
that of the spirit of Cicero.
