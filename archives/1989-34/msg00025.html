Hi there, folx. I've only posted to Love-Hounds a couple of times, but while
waiting for a vacuum system to stabilize in the lab I read a backlog of about
150 posts to the group, and I've gotten a concentrated dose of the tenor of
the current discussions. I've decided to risk another post, despite the fact
that the last time I set foot on this group I got my proverbial arse shot off
by somebody (don't think it was Drukman or IED, though) for daring to suggest
that there were people out there who were better with a Fairlight than Kate,
and the time before that I got into an Email flamewar with Damian Roskill 
over the advice he'd given a synth newcomer on getting started. (As it turns
out, Damian and I have developed a pleasant Email acquaintance now that we've
stopped beating on each other, and the newcomer in question ended up listening
to neither of us. *sigh*) I have learned, therefore, to restrict commentary 
and controversy on electronic music gear to rec.music.synth, where it belongs,
and will attempt to focus this, my third attempt to post here and survive
unscorched, on a rather novel subject for rec.music.gaffa: Kate Bush. 

At any rate, I read (in one two-hour sitting) the past month's exchange between
Andrew, IED, Drukman, |&gt;oug, and the various others who have contributed 
materially or immaterially to the question of whether or not Kate is perfect,
etc., etc., etc. It was a lot to absorb in such a short time, and probably
bears rereading. However, I have only managed to come up with a single question
that has managed to escape intact through my merciless self-censorship system
("Don't comment on THIS subject, you'll start a fistfight. THAT'S an insult;
delete it. Is this post obviously IED-like enough yet? No! Where's my damned
thesaurus?" etc.), and that is this one. I would like to ask, with absolutely
no hostile intent or wish to injure, offend, or insult anyone at all, and
solely for the purpose of my own edification and enlightenment:

Has any of you ever actually MET Kate Bush? Not just seen her in a record store
or on stage, mind you, but had a chance to actually chat with her for more than
the fan's usual thirty seconds?

I know that |&gt;oug managed a short interview with her some time ago, but I 
don't know about the rest of the combatants. You may argue that meeting the
artist is immaterial toward the appreciation of the art; this may well be 
true. I AM curious, however, for reasons of my own concerning occasional
personal contact and conversation with the lady in question.

Thank you in advance for your replies.

PS. No, the .sig file WON'T make sense to most of you. Don't sweat it.
