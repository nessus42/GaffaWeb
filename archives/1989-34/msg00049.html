						Oslo, 3. Dec. 1989
	Dear Steve,
It's 8 in the night.  I just turned on the TV to watch UK TOP 30.  I
turned it on about 2 minutes too late, they were in the middle of a
Kate Bush video -- "THIS WOMAN'S WORK" !  I saw about 3/4 of it and of
course I freaked completely out.  I'm not exactly sure what was really
going on in that video -- I main in a hospital waiting room, and Kate
(his wife, I guess) was the one who had been grought to hospital.  I
don't know if she was pregnant.  In the last part of the fideo, you
see something -- that man and Kate in a restaurant, suddenly Kate
fainted, dragged the whole table cloth and everything with her ass she
fell off the chair.  The man carried her out to a car, and drove very
fast through the dark, rainy night, I guess he drove right to the
hospital.  I don't really know if Kate died or not, because they cut
the video right before the end, but from what I saw of it, I get the
impression that she (or the baby/or both?) died, but I'm not at all
sure.  I hope to see it again soon, since it has now entered the
UK Top 30 (it was no. 30, new entry, this week) I guess I'll keep
watching the Top 30 in the coming weeks.  I can't believe this -- now
it's commercials on Super Channel -- so I turned over to MTV, right in
the middle of "Running Up That Hill" !!!  You see, MTV is running a
"TOP 100 songs of the 80's" tonight, and "Running Up That Hill" was on
no. 32.  Great, this is the Kate Bush night!  So, what I said to you
on the phone, about "This Woman's Work" being released as single, was
right!!  I think they're very aware of the time of year for that
release, that song has potential to become a really popular Christmas
single!  Oh, yippee, this was really fantastic.  I'll keep you
informed about how it does in the charts from now on.  Yah!

I can't think of much more to say, seeing that new kate video (and
also "Running Up That Hill") made me forget everything else!

I got this letter from Kari, who isn't here now, a few weeks ago.  She
indicated that it was fine if I posted it to Love-Hounds, which I've
done.  I tried to type it as she wrote it, without deleting any of her
errors or adding any of my own.  I'll be happy to forward any mail to
her if you want to send it to her at this address.

Steve Schonberger	Why should I disclaim anything when I own this site?

I should be mapped.  If mail bounces, use "nwnexus!sensual!steve" instead.
