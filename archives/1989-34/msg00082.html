This should stir'em up some. Here is our interpretation of the Video for 
"Love And Anger". Just the video.

The parts in {}'s are from Chris. The Parts in []'s are from Vickie.

Video starts with a:
BLURRY SHOT
    {Not much meaning here. Just a blurry shot of the skirts of the Sufis.}

Next Kate is:
IN THE SPOTLIGHT
     {This is it. The record that's going to "break her" in America. All eyes
are upon her.}  

In her hands are:
JEWELRY
     {Could it be a rosary? She is on her knees, is she praying? For what?}
 
She is:
SHOWERED WITH GOLD
    {As she will be, metaphoricaly, if she succeeds in America, the last
holdout in the "civilized" world. We feel this video is the direct result of
a conversation with CBS record executives.}

She drops her:
JEWELERY
    [Possibly "pearls before swine"?]

She spins with her:
HEAD DOWN, ARMS OUTSTRETCHED
   ["Here I am, do what you will"]

She is handed the:
CROWN JEWELS
    {Not all the crown jewels, just the Orb and Septre, but definitely the
British Crown Jewels, symbolic of her Britishness.} 

In come the:
BALLET DANCERS
     {The Ballet Dancers may represent what CBS thinks of her recent videos,
serious and hoity-toity. They may have told her to "loosen up" and stop taking
herself so seriously.}

And she:
STANDS THERE
   {As everyone knows, in American rock videos, she singer just stands there
while dancers rush around, trying desperatly to create the illusion that the
singer is dancing, as in videos by Kim Karnes, Rod Stewart, Elton John and 
others. God forbid that the singer actually try to dance, as in Sting's "We'll
Be Together". Kate, as we all know, can dance very well, but she tried that
with "Running Up That Hill" and that video was bumped in favor of a TV show
in which she was safely behind a podium.} 

Then the ballet dancers:
FADE AWAY

Then Sufi Dancers or:
WHIRLING DEVERISHS 
     {Don't you just love them. I do.} [ditto]

The ballet dancers come back and:
TAKE THE CROWN JEWELS
     {Or her Britishness, as CBS may be trying to do.} 

Causing Kate to:
VIBRATE VIOLENTLY
     [Free &amp; easy, loose, "Americanized"]

And start:
GOING BACKWARDS
     {Being told to pander to the American market would no doubt be a 
[huge] step backwards for Kate at this point in her career.}

The camera pans left to a:
ARCH-TYPICAL "AMERICAN ROCK VIDEO"
     {Dave Guilmor with a wind machine in his face. This video is exclusivly
for the American market. Peter Fitzgerald-Morris tells us it hasn't been shown
in England. Near as we can tell CBS picked this song as the first single and 
asked her for "a video for the American market" and she must have thought "Hmm..
a video for America? Well I guess we'll just have to make an American video."
So she made as American a video as she could.}

Our heroine gets:
CARRIED IN FEET FIRST
      {As she well would have to be. This type of video is known the well-known,
and much dreaded, "Band-in-a-Box"}

And starts to:
GYRATE WILDLY
    {Near as I can tell this is something between The Pony and The Frug. I think
Joey Heatherton invented this one on Hullaballoo.}
[no one has commented on the "hullaballoo" dance moves she made in in the
Dreaming video-same influences at work]

Surrounded by:
CLICHED SHOTS OF BAND MEMBERS
     {Possible award winner for Most-Cliched Visuals on the MTV Music Video 
Awards (a hotly contested catagory). The worst lighting I've seen in years. 
Par lamps on a straight truss on a chase!! This *cannot* be anything other
than a JOKE, the lighting equivilent of a guitarist running his/her hand up
and down the neck of his/her gee-tar (Kate called this action "obviously wanking
away up there")(see: Heart or any Heavy Metal). Take it from me, the lighting is
dumber than a box of rocks. On purpose. Kate's videos are always well and
subtly lit.}

Until she:
THROWS THE GOLD GLITTER AT THE CAMERA
     {With a manical grin on her face. Watch it in slow motion.}

Thus ends Kate's funniest video. I've broken it down for ease of commenting
by other Love-Hounds. We've run this past Doctor of Katebusholigy Peter David
Fitzgerald-Morris of "Homeground" and he found it amusing and very likely given
Kate's sense of humor. Remember this is Kate we are talking about, Our Lady of
the Oblique Reference, the one who puts lyrics in her songs that even her most
ardent fans cannot decipher, the one who hides secret symbols on her records,
the one who once answered a simple question, "what kind of makeup do you use?",
with, "oh, I don't use makeup anymore, I use latex!". Comments welcome.


                                  Love, 
                                      Chris'n'Vickie
                                      [or Vickie'n'Chris]

[notice how the title can be turned into Love an' Danger? No special
significance, I just think it's neat]
