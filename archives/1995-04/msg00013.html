TSB, Adelaide Australia says:

&gt;I'm actually a well-informed feminist.
&gt; I already know full well everything you stated, and also much more about
&gt; the issue than you are ever likely to know given that you don't even
&gt; recognize the difference between nudity and pornography. I'm also sorry
&gt; to say that the articles are the worst feature of the magazines. I'd like
&gt; to see the streets of Los Angeles if anyone there ever tried to publish
&gt; a magazine as racist as these publications are sexist. Think about it.

I'm sorry, but this is bull-shit. Playboy is put out for men. It is a men's
magazine. It's written for men. Do you get the point yet. Cosmo is written
for women. Glamour is written for women. These mags have articles like, "
ten ways to keep you man faithfull". Come on. Playboy does not have any
articles that slam women, at least none that I have really seen. Magazines
that are aimed at certain people will always make assumtions about the people
that read them, and assumtions about the people who don't read the magazine.
Penthouse (in my opinion) is much more raunchy than Playboy. It is a SEX
magazine. Playboy is a MEN's magazine. Cosmo is a WOMEN's magazine. Ebony is
an AFRICAN-AMERICAN's magazine. GQ is a WEALTHY MEN's magazine. None of them
are really racist or sexist, they are just aimed at certain audiences.

I think Chris recognizes the difference between nudity and pornography.
Pornography is an album by the Cure, and nudity is when you take off your
clothes. But you have to realize that Pornography was a really, really cool
album. But seriously, I don't think that nudity and pornography are two VERY
distinct things. Is pornography defined as something people can masterbate
to? People do it to National Geographic. People do it to Hussler. A lot of the
pictures in Playboy are not sexual. 99% of the pictures in Penthouse are. I
think that I would say that both Playboy and Penthouse are in the Grey area
between nudity and pornography. But I think, if you compaired Playboy to a
hard core porn flick, Playboy would barely be considered nudity. I think the
difference is, Playboy tries to make their models look sensual, not sexual (in
a lot of the cases). Penthouse and harder things, just go for the sex.

And, by the way, I am a well informed equal-ist. My fiance reads Playboy. She
likes it. She is also one of the least sexually oriented people that I have
met. I think some of the articles are quite amusing, as I think some of the
articles in Cosmo are pretty amusing.

I basically feel that your statement about being a feminist is more sexist
than Playboy or Cosmo. If you believe in Feminine equality, than call your
self a equal-ist. If you believe that most men are scum, then call your self
a feminist and be proud of being sexist. (This paragraph is full of
prejudgists, I don't really believe it too much. I just thought it would be
a nice touch...)

A typical male that like to look at beautiful naked women,

Aaron
