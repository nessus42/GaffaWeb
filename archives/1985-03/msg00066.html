&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am not convinced anything on the album, other than "Jig of Life,"
&gt; &gt; has any metaphors to it, yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh come now!  The whole of "The Ninth Wave" is metaphorical is the same
&gt; way that Conrad's "The Hurricane" is metaphorical.  

I didn't say it wasn't metaphorical... I just said I hadn't
determined that it was yet.

&gt; Also, RUTH is *not*
&gt; about jogging and construction workers!  (Don't worry J. Eric, I'll get
&gt; around to responding to that claim sometime soon....)  

You would have a much harder time convincing me of that than of
anything else at the moment, since I am now fairly convinced. 
You would have to explain these things:

	What the hill symbolizes.
	What the road symbolizes.
	What the building symbolizes.
	What the phrase "with no problems" means.

	And, finally, why the song has an angry tone.


&gt; "Hounds of Love"
&gt; is not really about dogs.  

That's obvious.

&gt; "The Big Sky" is not really about walking on
&gt; clouds.  

The big sky is about the same thing this Yes song is about:

	As we try and consider,
	We receive all we venture to give.
	All we say is our soul, constant sight-listener;
	We won't tender our song clear till we sail.
	Then I will be there.
	I will be there, as clearer companions
	will call to be near you.
	They move around --tell me that they move around,
	Surely sing-- as they don't seem to matter at all.
	At all...

&gt; And, actually, "Jig of Life" (the part Kate sings, rather) is the most
&gt; straightforward song on the album.  Once you figure it out, nearly every
&gt; line is completely clear and unambiguous.  The subtle and poetic way she
&gt; says what she's saying is so perfect, though, it's a masterpiece!

But that's what good poetry is good for.  It shouldn't be
undecipherable.

&gt; 
&gt; 		"Now is the place where the crossroads meet"

	"As is written in the Koan, `what is the sound of one
	 hand clapping,' so we believe that the audience is
	 an essential part of our music." -- Jon Anderson
