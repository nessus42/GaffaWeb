Inner City Unit/Maximum Effect (1981)
	Nik Turner, Tren Thoms, Dead Fred, Dino Ferari, Captain Sensible,
	Bill Boston, Max Wall

I have seen many of these LPs for sale in the past year in the import
bins of major city record stores.  These include all the ones which I
have (exceptions Quark Strangeness &amp; Charm, 25 Years On, Space Ritual)
and also Live 79 and Road Hawks.  Numerous compilation LP's also exist
along with a couple of picture discs.  Most of these have been re issued
sometimes without duplicating the strangeness of the LP jackets (In
Search of Space for example).  I have the LP numbers for all of the
above LPs.  Let me know if you need them.  If anyone finds a source for
the Inner City Unit LPs, tell me where.  Likewise, let me know if you
get any response from Hawkwind Feedback.

Rock Family Trees has a good bit of Hawkwind trivia.

/* END INCLUDED TEXT */

There's some other stuff I know of that wasn't mentioned by Roger.  Some
of this I have (indicated by "*"), some of this I only have on tape (and
never seen -- indicated by "+" -- sometimes more than one generation
old), and some of this I've never seen, only heard about (indicated by
"#" -- like Inner City Unit [Nik Turner's Group]).

*Masters of the Universe (1977) -- Compilation album.

*Live 1979 (1980) -- Live album.

#Repeat Performace (1980) -- No idea what it is, but it's not a studio
album.

Friends and Relations -- *Volume I (1982), Volume II (?), and *Volume
III (?) -- Miscelaneous live tracks and compilation stuff from related
groups.

*Choose Your Masques (1982).

#Indpendents Day (1984) -- Compilation of singles.

Space Ritual 2 (1984) -- Live album.

This is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic (1984) -- Live album.

Night of the Hawks (1984) -- EP.

Nik Turner
----------

+Sphinx -- Great pseudo-egyptian space music.  (Not with Inner City Unit.)

#Xitintoday (1978)

#New Anatomy (1985)


Michael Moorcock
----------------

New World's Fair (1975)


Robert Calvert
--------------

+Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters (1974)

#Lucky Lief and the Longships (1975)

#Hype (1982)

*Freq (1985)


There are also lots of singles, and Tim Blake and Steve Swindells also
have albums.  You probably already know about Motorhead (Lemmy), but I
don't like them, and thus don't follow them.
