	Thought I should offer my 2-cents on the current TSW discussion
... 
	I really enjoyed reading "Drewcifer's" description of the
record.  Infinitely preferable to what a local music reviewer described
it as: "Frosty and poised".  While certainly not the same flavour and
style of any of her earlier records, and probably my least-listened-to
of them, it stands on its own, and has its unique merits.
	Re. the laugh: I was always convinced that it belonged to "The
Fog", due to the length of time before and after it.  I always thought
that it was a mistake on the part of whoever transferred it to CD that
the track no. changes at the wrong time.  I remember checking the vinyl
to see if it lies before or after the dividing groove, but I forget what
I found.  Vickie: any conclusive evidence for your claim?  I wouldn't be
surprised if you're right, but it would shatter my perceived reality
=^).
	As for the sound quality, this is my biggest complaint.  I agree
that there is too much hiss.  Maybe this adds to the "lush" sound, but
I'd rather hear the crisp, clear tones of her first two albums (as far
as sound quality goes).  I don't know if it's due to the engineering,
mixing, mastering, or what, but this is definitely a problem.  And yes,
"Heads We're Dancing" _is_ my least favourite on the LP!
	And I still can't figure out why so many of you net.people don't
like "Reaching Out"!
