&gt; &gt; First time I saw this I immediately thought of the mendicant friars such 
&gt; &gt; as the Franciscians, although they originally wore grey. Anyway the very 
&gt; &gt; Christian overtone to the song never suggested Druids...and as far as 
&gt; &gt; I've ever read the druid priests wore white...I don't think they're were 
&gt; &gt; actually any priestess'...anyone have anthropological data?
&gt; &gt;                      Kateness,
&gt; &gt;                             Lionheart
&gt; 
&gt; Now that you mention it, I do remember something about white robes. As
&gt; for priestesses, wasn't Boudicca (spelling probably wrong, I'd have to
&gt; check a book that's not with me right now), a Druidess? Not necessarily
&gt; a priestess, I guess. But she was a leader of her people.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the symbolism of the bow, in the context of the other elements
&gt; of the Wogan performance? It is definitely not a Christian element, but
&gt; was central to the imagery of the performance.

&gt;                 I  still dream of Orgonon.                      |/
&gt;                                                                 |\

 Actually it's Queen [B[C[C[C[C[C[C[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[
(line noise sorry) Queen Boadicea, she was a Celtic tribal leader (Gaelic 
Celt) but not a priestess any more than Cu Chulainn was a priest. Digging 
through my library I came up with two good books tha might help in this 
matter. The Celts by T.G.E. Powell and The Druids by Stuart Piggott. It 
would seem that Boadicea was a druid in the sense that that is what the 
religion of her people was called but it doesn't seem to have been a 
theocratic form of government for the celts.
As for the bow symbolism...your guess is as good as mine. I think Ron has 
a quote from JC Bush about the bow bits of RUTH. I don't think Kate meant 
the song to be overly christian, allowing her freedom of symbolism.
