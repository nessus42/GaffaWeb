&gt;A friend of mine once suggested (don't worry -- not the same friend that told
&gt;me that Kate is a Druid priestess!) that the song "Get Out of my House" is
&gt;about rape.  She said that in the line "I change into the mule", the mule 
&gt;is important because a mule is sterile.  It makes sense to me -- what do other
&gt;people think?

Many people see GOoMH as being about rape.  Many others, including KaTe (who
may or may not be irrelevant to this discussion) do not.  I count myself
in the latter.  In this other interpretation, the song is "merely" about
a stupid, pointless, ridiculous arguement.  The female character is shutting
down and refusing to discuss the issue, while the male character is trying
to show how poitnless it is to break down communications.  The mule, as
KaTe told Our |&gt;oug is a symbol of stuborness.  By the end of the song, 
when the 'Sword in the Stone'-like dual takes place (each character shifting
shapes, one to elude the other, the other to catch the first) the female
turns into a mule and starts braying--a total standstill.

&gt;What is a gelignight?

Gelignite is one of those awfully handy things to have around when you want
to blow open a safe...;-)

&gt;Before I started reading love-hounds, I knew very few KaTefans.  All of them
&gt;were female, and I always assumed that Kate's audience was largely female.
&gt;Now that I'm reading love-hounds, it seems to me that most participants are
&gt;male.  I'm trying to decide if my original assumption was false and both
&gt;men and women listen to Kate in equal numbers, or if I was right and most
&gt;KaTefans are women, but more men are on love-hounds because more men use 
&gt;computers generally.  I don't mean this to be divisive in any way -- I'm
&gt;just curious.

And of course, if you're going to question the signficance of a possible
disproportion of male love-hounds to femal love-hounds, how many of those
love-hounds, male or female, are homosexual or bisxeual?  Of the KaTefans I 
know personally, I only know of one who's straight, and he doesn't even have 
all of her albums (heresy!)  All of my other straight friends invariably 
dislike her. 

Another question this brings up is the proportion of readers to the proportion
of posters.  Are women more or less likely to post than men?  

When I was at school, I knew roughly equal numbers of male and female 
KaTefans.

So what does it all mean?  I'm so confused!

Jeff
