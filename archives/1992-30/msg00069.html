 Since someone made mention of the often heard rumor "Kate is a druid" 
and there also was slight discussion of the end of Get Out of my House, I 
thought it would be a nice time to bring this topic up. First a 
disclaimer, I am in NO WAY saying that Kate is a Taoist (sorry for the 
spelling in the title) this is merely conjecture up one what facts I 
know..ok, got that, no flames, just all in fun.
 Let's first look at Kate's reluctance to speak about her religious 
practice/belief. This falls into accordance with a Taoist tradition "he 
who speaks does not know and he who knows does not speak." True this 
reluctance doesn't necessarily mean she's Taoist but also she has 
mentioned during an interview that everyone must follow their own God; 
she has her God but it may not be the same as yours. This coudl represent 
one's own personal journey toward enlightenment. In Taoist tradition it 
is hard to teach someone how to become enlightened, the "gods" as it 
werre are different for each individual. Moving right along, the end of 
Get Out of my House depicts a man chasing a woman about as they both 
change shapes. The Taoist creation myth: there originally was one entity 
that split into two parts --- ying and yang. As one tried to get back to 
the other they shifted through a myriad of shapes thus creating the 
creatures and other aspects of the world. Has this not piqued your 
curiosity yet? Well, let me point out the biggie. After Kate's release of 
Hol she was asked a question along the lines of "what's your biggest 
disappointment?" Kate replied, the break up of Killing Joke and she lost 
her I Ching cards!! The interviewer tried to press her on what I Ching 
cards are but she wouldn't say (again that "not speaking" tradition). For 
those of you who aren't familiar with the I Ching, it is a fortune 
telling method (like Tarot cards somewhat) used in the Taoist religion. I 
Ching is a hold over from when Taoism was more of a primitive ancestor 
worship religion. Well, I hope this starts some fun Kate related posts, 
but remember no flames....it's all in fun.
                     Kateness,
                           Lionheart
