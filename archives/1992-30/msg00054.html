"Odds and Sods" is a euphemism for a B-sides and miscellania release 
such as the one found in the boxed set, not an official name.  But yes, 
if I read what Peter said correctly it was considered for seperate 
release and Kate nixed it.  No details on why.

Someone mentioned a fanzine report that Kate and Del were breaking up,
supposedly from a reliable source.  I would take that with a huge
grain of salt.  Someone told me that rumor over a year ago and I'll
bet that the source is the same.  I declined to pass it along because
either this person has a very good source and shouldn't be passing
these kinds of personal rumors anyway, or this person has a very vivid
imagination and shouldn't be passing along these kinds of rumors
anyway. 

Meanwhile, the whole question of what is and is not appropriate 
material for Love-Hounds has reared it's head once again.  I think 
that if there's nothing else we can agree on, we should at least agree 
that everyone here has a right to their opinion on what does or doesn't
belong in Love-Hounds.  

The fact is that there must be some etiquette for what does and doesn't
belong in Love-Hounds.   If there are many people here that still don't
believe that, I can very easily dump several "related" mailing lists into
Love-Hounds and we'll all get a quick lesson in the real world.  The
fact is that if topics like Tori Amos and Happy Rhodes didn't spin off
into their own mailing lists, the fans of each of these artists and
most importantly KateFans would not be as well served as they are
now.

My feeling is, and always has been, that non-Kate traffic is fine, but
when it gains a life of it's own or becomes disruptive to the primary
purpose of Love-Hounds, it should be moved elsewhere for the good of 
all concerned.
