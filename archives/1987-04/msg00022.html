Now THIS is getting GOOD ....

&gt;Raffles takes offense at being called a cad by you, and there's nobody
&gt;called "Buttercup" here. What motivates you, Gregory, to spend so much
&gt;time and vent so much spleen on a shadow? Isn't THAT something to make
&gt;one "quiet and sad"? Fortunately, there seem to be a few Love-Hounds
&gt;out there who don't reject everything IED says with slipshod insults,
&gt;so he will not quit yet.  By the way, what makes you think they're ALL
&gt;coming from "one human being"?
&gt;
&gt;-- Andrew Marvick 

Now YOU know when this starts happening, from a WIMP no less, then
someone's doing their job RIGht.  I don't know Doug, all foul language
and slurs, we can't have this on our net.nazi.....

but here's something for sue to wank on after that thotically correct
psycheledic fursss review...

ART-PORN 87, Richard Kerm shows movies...

shit, I should have worn my damn long overcoat to this one, the
grossness of them.   I mean Kern might be getting all this money for
being trendy and all that, but to GROSS somneone out by showing them
pictures of lydia lunch giving blowJOBS??? are you serious ? The only
thing i could say to da man when I left was "at least you could of got
tracy lords instead of lydia." "The right side of my brain"  showed some
hip lydia in all her grotesquness, but was only in black and white.
avoid this one especially since it also contains henry "Spa Lady"
Rollins.  "You killed him first" shows karen Yams Finley getting up the
ass, Lung Leg being digusting, and just stupid.  Submit to Me was an
excercise in bondage, and if you like see Kim Renaldo tired to a chair,
then check this one out.  The final one was Exposed and had all sorts of
wierd shit in it.  Maybe the only one worth anything, if you cut out the
faked fist fucking scene.  as you all know, all of the movies have some
kind of sonic youth noise in their, so they're trendy.  

now go complain to doug....
