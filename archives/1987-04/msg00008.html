From: Bob Krajewski &lt;lmi-angel!rpk&gt;
&gt;[Is the Siouxsie and the Banshees album a cover of Bowie's _Pinups_ ?
&gt;Pop will eat itself, indeed...]

No.  You have to read between the lines; the reason I said `Pinups' is
because the concept of the album is almost exactly the same as that of
`Pinups' - namely, an all-covers album, with (most of) the songs being an
homage to their musical roots.  In Bowie's case, it was of course London
from 1964-1967; in the Banshees', it was from 1973-1977.  If you read
any Origins Of P-Rock books you'll find that Siouxsie and crew were weaned
on Glam and associated other alternative stuff of the period - thus the 
(not surprising to me) inclusion of Sparks, Roxy Music, Kraftwerk, Iggy, and
John Cale.  Admittedly the Doors, Billie Holliday (thanx, folks), and the
`Jungle Book' song throw things off the track somewhat, but it's still
their `roots'.  As I'm only a year or so behind them agewise, all of that
stuff is pretty familiar territory to me (Blackmail Corner: Yes, I have
owned the `Kimono My House' album from whence Sparks' `This Town Aint Big
Enough For The Both Of Us sprang for over 12 years!!  Aauggghh ... :-)

Also, I'm pretty sure that Lewis (Wire) is the remaining He Said'er, not
B.C. Gilbert (he left).

Humor:  Inner sleeve of `Snakedrill' gives a band/individuals/pairings
discography.  All of Colin Newman's stuff, Gilbert &amp; Lewis, etc.
Robert Gotobed is credited with
	organic farming

New Controlled Bleeding out - have it but unheard.

Got a Poison Gas Research record for $6.98, then found out it was
a 3 track 12".  Bleah - not fair, guys.

If Peter Alfke is awake, look sharp in the next coupla weeks for a
Factory/Flaming Creatures twin bill, either at the Anti-Club or at
a new Wednesday night club called the Krypt (at the Stardust Ballroom
on Sunset Blvd.).  Factory alone should be enough to get you out of
sleeping Pasadena; but the F.C. are two friends of ours (+2) who sound
a fair amount like HULA, that should get you out off your duff!!

Reeves, I ain't EVEN gonna try a Fall discography ...

Psssst!  Pass it on - Skinny Puppy returns, next month (to L.A. at least)
Tour dates Real Soon Now ... [the previous sentence may be ignored by all
those personages who maintain blinkered ideas about how a Rock and Roll 
concert must be presented (i.e., gtr/bass/drums/voc, 4 humans, no synth
or tapes puh-lleeze) and what its thematic concerns may be.  Thank you]

Good night

Greg
