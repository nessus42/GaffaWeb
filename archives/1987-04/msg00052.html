Well well well.  Thank you, :&gt;oug, for your support, and I apologize
in advance for the fact that the bar will be changed to a colon by the
time it gets to the rest of the love-hounds.  Next item of business:
it seems the Chameleons _will_ be coming back to UMass on March 1st,
I believe.  If anyone out there likes them a lot, you might want to
get your butt up here - UMass shows are notoriously inexpensive; I
believe the price of tickets for this show for non-UMass students is
$4.  And they will have a cash bar if you feel you need to get drunk.
Last night, Throwing Muses played here with a band called Mercy Seat
opening.  Mercy Seat were appallingly bad.  Awful with a capital "A".
It was really a pity, because the bassist and drummer were both very
capable players, as demonstrated by their respective solos.  However,
they had two things against them - 1&gt;1.  they played mostly gospel music,
albeit very rock'n'rollish gospel music.  Anyway, I was sick to death
of hearing how Jesus loves me by the third song.  2. They were extremely
silly inbetween songs.  I found the guitarist's attitude incredibly
juvenile.  I was not impressed.
   Throwing Muses, on the other hand, played with energy and enthusiasm,
fast and loud, and showed lots of talent.  The main problem I had with
the set is that I was combating a nasty head cold, and the lead vocalist
(Kristin Hersh, I believe) had this really shrill voice that was murder
on my head.  I didn't stay for the entire set, not because they were bad,
but because I had a killer headache.
   Sorry you missed Birdsongs, Jurgen - call the management of the Iron
Horse in Northampton and BEG them to book Roger Miller when he does his
next Maximum Electric Piano tour!!
   Apologies to IED and all the other love-hounds for resending my
letter of a few days ago... The management of love-hounds at our site
has recently changed hands, and there were a few missed digests.  Again
my apologies.
