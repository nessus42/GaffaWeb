Let's see - saw the Moving Targets/Volcano Suns and Dag Nasty last night.  Hell,
I'm getting like Wicinski and was put on the guest list (for spreading about
300 flyers around the city).  The Moving Targets could be described as Husker
Du playing Metallica but not as metally (thanks to Pee Wee Herman for opening
up a whole new line of adverbs) with the screeching and/or revved up time
changes (depending on whether you're coming or going) and lotsa key changes
but hey, this was one night in which I was bothered not hearing the lyrics
since I wanted to know for what reason everyone seemed so lackluster in
this three piece band - did their lyrics promote this or what?  This band
probably wouldn't do bad on a bill with Gone or any of the other burgeoning
post-hardcore-metal-rock-jazzists searching for a niche in an increasingly
upwardly mobile listening audience since they did have alot of propsensity
to jam - a bit too much at times... Well, it should be mentioned that my
skinhead pals didn't really like this stuff that didn't fit into their
definition of "rock and roll" and decided to let the Volcano Suns know it
with taunts lifted from the WWF and the Suns just took it all on the cheek
and churned and blasted through a fine, yet at times disappointing set.  Again,
the sound in this place (a mid-largish Polish (read: Weddings) Meeting Hall)
has a lot to be desired, guess when they built it they only expected it
for ethnic folk and swarmy wedding bands not forseeing these average
looking Joes owning the stage.  Just like they said in a Baltimore Sun
interview, the set material was evenly distributed over their three albums
with the more recent stuff really showing off the Suns ability to create
a solid wall of moving sound - can't get "Village Idiot" (or the lyrics
out of my head).... .... Finally, the skins were pacified as the razor
pop Dag Nasty took over the expansive stage.  As everyone in fanzine land
knows, Brian Baker (ex-Minor Threat, ex-Doggy Rock, ex-lotsa-other-stuff-
including-the-Meatmen) is back and looks to be battening down for the long
haul he would like to take this band on.  Talking to him revealed he stills
feels "gypped" that Minor Threat had to disentegrate rather than cash
in on their post-humous (and post-breakup shortened reunion) fame and would
like to get this band at least working.  Fat chance if they stay on 
Dischord but, who knows - if the rec co. A&amp;R chumps are sniffing around
the Volcano Sun's butts, it's not hard to believe that Dag Nasty could
be pulled in, too.  The only problem (as has been their main problem
throughout their history) is the vocalist needs a little (scratch that,
alot) of experience but hey, at least he isn't imitating MacKaye like
his predecessors (Smalley excluded, of course).  The bassist (ex-Descendents)
is a new strong point of the group and is able to maintain the speed
required to power up their energy levels............................

P.S.  The rumor after the show had it that the Suns were cancelling the
rest of their area dates and returning home to Boston to weather out
some band tensions (primarily between Prescott, drummer/songwriter/singer
and the other chumps)....  stay tuned with tinny ear glued to the 
speakers.


(Also, someone from Texas sent me a request for Nihilius Fililius and
I lost his address - can he send me some e-mail or a note with his
addresss to my new p.o. box - 1067, Oxon Hill, MD  20745 - other
correspondents please note change of address...)

to be alot of propensity to jam - a bit too much at times in fact...
