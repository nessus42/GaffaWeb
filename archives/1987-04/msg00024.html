All right, I'm a convert!
I got more or less suckered into seeing Birdsongs at the Iron Horse cafe
in the nearby city of Northampton - but I wasn't disappointed!
I was easily seduced by the rhythms, and inventive synthesizer ideas.
They had a great presence too, and told stupid jokes in between the
songs.  I was so impressed that I bought one of their albums "Magnetic
Flip" during the break between the sets.
They played with lots of energy, and they went totally wild on such
songs as "Theme From Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle" and "Beat Of The Mesozoic"
the latter closing the show with amazing pounding percussion lines.
In any case, I highly recommend that you see them whenever possible
and buy all their albums cos they're struggling artists and need all
the $ they can get - and they deserve it.  There aren't many people
doing their kind of music nowadays... In fact, the only one I can really
think of is some of Brian Eno's work, but not Eno's more recent stuff.
In fact, Birdsongs covered the Eno song "Sombre Reptiles" in grand fashion
during the first set.
