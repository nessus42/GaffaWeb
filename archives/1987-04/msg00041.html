Can we PLEASE rename this (un)modlist mod.music.ied?

Musical content:  Our local Payless always seems to have an enormous
number of interesting cassettes available at $1.99 each.  Pickwick
International reissues the strangest stuff at rock bottom prices.  This
evening's key find:  "Persuasive Percussion."  I would guess this is
another Terry Snyder LP (I have a couple of other PP albums with his
name on them).  Classic late-50's early Stereo Ping-Pong percussion,
with the music and bongos bouncing around the channels.  Included are
excellent schlock versions of "I'm in the Mood For Love" "Misirlou"
(not as good as the Arthur Lyman version) "Taboo" and "Aloha Oe."

I also picked up a number of volumes of an Italian rock 'n' roll 'n'
soul oldies collection, "La grande storia del ROCK."  I bought 4
volumes, each featuring anywhere from one to 10 cuts by a number of
different artists including Johnny &amp; The Hurricanes, Kingsmen,
Exellents, Classics IV, String-A-Longs, Cowsills, Little Richard,
Jimmy Reed, Sam Cooke, Joe Simon, Lou Rawls.  Some artists have just
their hits, while others (like Johnny &amp; The Hurricanes) have 8 cuts,
none of which are "Red River Rock."  The ones I've listened to are
all original versions, with reasonable fidelity (c'mon, old recordings
on $1.99 cassettes).  You have to be very careful with these cheapo
oldie collections that you don't get ORIGINAL STARS (new versions)...

I got a couple of Italian jazz colections as well, featuring Duke
Ellington (with Johnny Hodges, Cootie Williams and Cat Anderson),
Ray Charles, Joe Turner, Memphis Slim and Ella Fitzgerald.

Plus, Pickwick has a number of "2 Packs" at $3.99.  I got a country
collection that has some really cool stuff like Wink Martindale's
"Deck of Cards."

Not to mention the regular titles their clearing at at 3/$7.00.  I
got Prince's "Around the World in a Day" (s-o-r-r-y, I happen to like
it)...

Recent vinyl finds... I finally got my hands on an original
glow-in-the-dark version of Penetration's "Moving Targets" (for only
$7.99!), at Village Music.  For you record collectors in (or visiting)
the Bay Area who've never been to Village Music in Mill Valley, you've
missed THE best record store around.  The most extensive
collection at reasonable (not cheap, but reasonable) prices.  Walls
that are decorated floor to ceiling (and ceilings wall to wall) with
posters and pictures.  Just about every imaginable type of music, an
extensive magazine section, and knowledgable and friendly employees.
I also got a cool 50 Guitars play Hits of San Francisco LP there...
with a boss instrumental version of "Somebody to Love."

A local thrift store yielded an interesting Puppy Training Record...
not having a dog I knew it was for me, and it's turned out to be an
excellent disc for sequeing with Industrial on the radio.  Everyone
seems to think it's part of whatever Industrial muzak fits around
it.  The Art Linkletter record I found recently ("The Story of You")
also works well in this capacity.

Enough wind for now...
