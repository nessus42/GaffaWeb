<PRE>
I had written a real pithy and incisive reply to another one of IED's
attempts to put Experiment IV among the gods, but it got lost somewhere
between Here and There.  So, without the benefit of the original posting,
I will try to get my points across.
 
IED accused :&gt;oug and myself of being "weird" merely because we singled
out ONE track from "The Ninth Wave" as an example of a song superior
to Experiment IV... I would like to remind IED that Kate herself saw
fit to release "Jig Of Life" (the track mentioned) as the B-Side to a
12"... So maybe IED is the one who is weird (or maybe IED is irreproachable
and KATE is the one being weird here...)
 
IED also rebutted my opinion of the violin intro as "weepy" by saying
something like "it is NOT weepy!"  Well, I said it sounds weepy to me,
and unless IED is going to volunteer some concrete way of telling whether
a passage is "weepy" or not, my opinion will have to stand.
 
The other point was IED's gross misinterpretation of my joke ("Skylarking"
is the number two album, but I don't know what the number one album is)
as an example of "sloppy thinking".  GET REAL IED, CAN'T YOU TELL ATTEMPTED
HUMOR WHEN YOU READ IT??  Or maybe you could come down off your high horse
long enough to read a sentence twice and think about it logically:  could
that phrase be interpreted as saying something like "well it's definitely
one of the best albums of the year, but I can't or don't feel like assigning
absolute ratings to them"?  I think so.
