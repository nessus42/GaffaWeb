KT NEWS:
 
The CD of Never For Ever (a German pressing) is now in import
stores in the L.A. area. Residents should hurry to Aron's,
where they just got a LARGE number of The Dreaming and Never For
Ever CDs in, but three were sold in the first five minutes or so.
 
Mail bag:
&gt;Hey, IED, I'm STILL waiting for you to damn the Butthole Surfers as
&gt;un-Kate-like and therfore "bad."  Wattsamattah?  Can't RISE to the
&gt;challenge, boy?
&gt;
&gt;                                                            "Yeah" - Lennon
&gt;
&gt;                                                            James Hofmann
 
Sorry, Hofmann got mistaken for Wicinski. (Is there any real difference)?
Anyway, |&gt;oug already "shredded" (to use the popular L-Hs term) your
comparison.
 
&gt;From: drukman%UMASS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu
&gt;          (Jonathan S. Drukman)
&gt;Subject:  Goddamn mailer trashed my message
&gt;
&gt;I had written a real pithy and incisive reply to another one of IED's
&gt;attempts to put Experiment IV among the gods, but it got lost somewhere
&gt;between Here and There.  So, without the benefit of the original posting,
&gt;I will try to get my points across.
&gt;
&gt;IED accused :&gt;oug and myself of being "weird" merely because we singled
&gt;out ONE track from "The Ninth Wave" as an example of a song superior
&gt;to Experiment IV... I would like to remind IED that Kate herself saw
&gt;fit to release "Jig Of Life" (the track mentioned) as the B-Side to a
&gt;12"... So maybe IED is the one who is weird (or maybe IED is irreproachable
&gt;and KATE is the one being weird here...)
&gt;
&gt;IED also rebutted my opinion of the violin intro as "weepy" by saying
&gt;something like "it is NOT weepy!"  Well, I said it sounds weepy to me,
&gt;and unless IED is going to volunteer some concrete way of telling whether
&gt;a passage is "weepy" or not, my opinion will have to stand.
&gt;
&gt;The other point was IED's gross misinterpretation of my joke ("Skylarking"
&gt;is the number two album, but I don't know what the number one album is)
&gt;as an example of "sloppy thinking".  GET REAL IED, CAN'T YOU TELL ATTEMPTED
&gt;HUMOR WHEN YOU READ IT??  Or maybe you could come down off your high horse
&gt;long enough to read a sentence twice and think about it logically:  could
&gt;that phrase be interpreted as saying something like "well it's definitely
&gt;one of the best albums of the year, but I can't or don't feel like assigning
&gt;absolute ratings to them"?  I think so.
&gt;

All of the above DID get through the first time. It
didn't get lost, and it was all answered at length.

&gt;I don't wanna discuss the people that dance to the music.  I wanna hear
 
Ditto.
 
&gt;I wanna hear about the music itself.
 
Same here.
