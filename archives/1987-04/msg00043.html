Opinions and Facts from the Neuromancer...
 
     About Brian Eno... I find his music very enjoyable, all of it, from his fir
as an artist he is inovative and experimental, and he has without a doubt
had a TREMENDOUS effect on modern music and the industry. But one thing
he is not: a good musician. Brian can't sing, can't play the piano, and
fakes the guitar very poorly. Not that it matters... he makes up for it
by getting some of the best studio musicians available to do the work
for him. And he *IS* a craftsman... but his craft is not in playing or
performing music, but rather in engineering and producing it. This ties
in very well with what Doug mentioned about the statement on the cover
to "Discreet Music".
 
     I missed Birdsongs. I'm pissed. Anyone know where else they'll be
playing in the New England Area..? (I've seen them once before, a long
time ago, and i can only agree with everything Jon Drukman said)
 
     This list goes to a "public notesfile" at UMass, where it's kept
for about 4-8 issues backward, and everyone who has access to the
Universities mainframe can read it. I used to do so on a regular basis,
but finally got out of the habit for one reason: The gist of the list
is "IED vs. World", and I just don't have the time to update 15 minutes
of so much hot air about absolutely nothing at all every day. It's too
bad, too, because there is *SOME* good information on here regularly.
 
     So, even though I am impartial in the subject of the debate, (I don't
care who's right, sometimes I'd side with IED, sometimes with others), I
can only agree with Mr. John Hogge at this point...
 
&gt; In case noone's noticed...
&gt;
&gt; IED is a complete waste of time.  I suggest ignoring his mail and
&gt; devoting
&gt; more time to reviewing music.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; --John
 
     Relevant discussion about music, reviews, announcements, and even
a certain amount of editorial type comments are worthy of being distributed
nationwide over the omnipresent bitstream... useless and futile attacks
at each others personalities and excessive display of pure attitude are
not. If you must do such things, why the hell don't you just mail it
direct..? Keep it amongst those of you who care, ok..? Most of us don't.
