An interesting bit of Ithaca news for the KognoscenTe.
The local college radio station has a Friday "sixpack"
competition, where 2 groups are pitted against each other in
a phone-in contest. The group with the most call-in votes gets
a six-in-a-row play on the air late Friday afternoon.

Last Friday they had Kate against Suzanne Vega*. Not only did
Kate win, but she got more calls than they had ever
received for any artist. Additionally, the station received so
many calls while they were playing the six songs, asking
who it was, and saying that they liked it, that they added
a 7th song to the play list.

(* To put this in perspective: SV has played in concert locally,
   and is popular here)

I've really enjoyed this group in the year or so I've followed it.
Love Hounds has introduced me to a lot of music I wouldn't have
even looked for otherwise; this is certainly a positive side of
this group. (picayune on)The negative side is that a few people seem 
to have no clue that you can use the internet for mail as easily as 
you can post articles to this group. It would be nice if personal 
attacks could be exchanged outside of this group.(picayune off) 

Who did the five act play, "The Decline and Fall of Pink Floyd"
in this group almost a year ago? I seem to have lost it, but at
the time I thought it was particularly bizarre and entertaining.
