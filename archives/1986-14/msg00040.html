<PRE>
I talked to Peter Morris, one of the editors of *Homeground: The
International Kate Bush Fanzine*, a few days ago.  It turns out that
the story about the bootleg record "Kate Bush: The Early Years" was
not an April Fools joke.  It does exist, and a warehouse full of these
things are sitting somewhere in East Germany waiting to be destroyed.
(Oh, by the way, Doug is catching the next plane to East Germany....
They tell him it's hard to sneak around there, however.)  This info
comes right from the mouth of John Carder Bush, so it's unlikely to be
made up.  No one I know, other than JCB has actually seen one yet,
though.  (Whimper, whimper.)

There is going to be another Kate Bush Convention in England this
year.  It will be on November 9th, and this one is going to be much
more informal than the previous ones.  A video dance club is being
rented, and for six hours all the screens are going to be showing all
sorts of Kate Bush related video.  Kate's band and family will be
there and people will be encouraged to just wander around and talk to
everyone else.  Kate will almost definitely be there, and this time,
the folks at *Homeground* hope to convince Kate to come at the
beginning and just mingle with everyone for the six hours.  Tickets
will be sold by mail in the next issue of *Homeground* and through the
Kate Bush Club.

I'm not sure if I can picture Kate just mingling with 400 rabid
fans...  But people tend to much politer in England...
