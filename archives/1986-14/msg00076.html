A new KBC Newsletter was received by IED today, and he forthwith relays
news of the utmost importance to the world at large.

First and foremost, Kate has recorded a vocal of the title song
to Terry Gilliam's film "Brazil". Although it was not in the film
itself, it does appear on the album.
Incidentally, any L-H who has not seen "Brazil" is strongly
advised to do so without delay. When IED saw it (twice in a row)
in Paris last year he was overwhelmed, and could see its affinity to
Kate's work in countless details.

Next in importance is Kate's new clue for the solution to the
"backwards" track in "Watching You Without Me".
The passage has been more precisely located in the new Newsletter,
and it is significant, perhaps, that nowhere is the term "backwards"
used. Three new clues have been given which should make the solution
a simple matter: first, the message begins with the word "Don't";
second, the message is twelve words in length; and third, the message
is "repeated" three times (by which IED assumes it is meant that the
message is uttered three times in all, i.e. "repeated" twice).

The third piece of interesting news is that further mention (albeit
still no confirmation) of the proposed EMI compilation, "Kate
Bush's Greatest Hits", or "The Best of Kate Bush", has been made
in the new Newsletter; and the possibility has once more been
acknowledged that a new song might be included in such a release.

Peter and Dave include a flier confirming the Kate Bush Video Party
at the Video Cafe on Argyle Street in London this November 9th.
A new t-shirt will be on sale at the party.

Kate is interviewed about the four promotional films by a pleasant
old lady of enigmatic origin named Auntie Hetty.
There is an account of the three Comic Relief performances by
Del's friend Byron Crundwell, a silly bit about playing
live beetles as musical instruments by Paddy, and the lyrics to
"Handsome CabinBoy" (not as complete as those provided to
L-Hs earlier) are reprinted. Del is also quite silly about his letters.
Jay tries to explain his lateness in producing "Cathy", and
succeeds in some degree; meanwhile offering as mollifier
a heretofore unseen photo of Kate aged circa ten.
A nice (but superfluous at this point) account of the "Big Sky"
shoot by Krys Thomas (related to Paul?), and Paul T. provides
the first episode of a new comic strip, very charming, about
Kate, Zoodle and Pye on a trip to the land of the original KT.
Plus, a new "complete works" book of Kate's sheet music is
announced (although not yet available); and there are many
fine photos, mostly from the "Big Sky" filming.
