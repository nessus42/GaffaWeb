I wish I could figure out how I managed to send direct mail to Greg Taylor
in the past (please, Doug, I don't need another lecture on net-mail  
Anyway, in order to bribe Hsu, you have to come up with a rare cd release
of 'The VAX newsletter : a Digital Production', and offer it to him in return
for a plug.  Among us (Hofmann, Labovitz, Taylor and myself), maybe we should
each exchange a copy of our stuff.  That would insure that at least 4 remote
locations would have an archival copy in case of WW III.  Christ5, am I 
spelling anything with mnore than 5 letters correctly today?
As for Gone to Earth, are you refering to BJH's (those of you under 27 can
ponder that acronym for~r awhile).  If so, I wasw in touch with a guy
who does purchasing for Tower in LA and there is apparently some sort of
`deal being made with bothg Polydor and MCA in which a collectors LP of BJH's
stuff will be releasaed.  Since, they figure that the big hits will do well
in a new generation, there is talk of a cd compilation.  As I hear it, much
will come froim Gone to Earth (including, Love is Like a Violin, Poor Man's
Moody Blues, Spirit on the Water, Hard HGearted Wowman and Take me Higher).
You have to realize, that few people who correspond on this net can even
remember BJH, let alone identify the stuff{_.  It isn't like Lead Zep or
The Who for which replay is a normal thing. 
Finally, Greg, you might as well send your tape along with the 'Net-release', I
will send prompt payment (within reason, and much sooner than the time it took me
to get a copy of the net tape).

Personally, I'm waiting for the cd releaser of 'The Sounds of Love from A
   to Zzzzz'
