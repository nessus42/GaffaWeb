A while back I sent to Love-Hounds an excerpt from the flyer now
included in the Dead Kennedys' album "Frankenchrist" instead of the H.R.
Giger poster "Penis Landscape".  That message made reference to a
publication called "The Punk Rock and Heavy Metal Handbook" published by
the Back in Control Center of Orange County, CA.  The latest issue of
the local New Times weekly (Sep.  24-30) has an article based on an
interview with Darlyne Pettinicchio, who wrote the PR&amp;HM handbook.  Here
are some excerpts from the article:

The 29-page handbook not only provides thumbnail definitions of punk and
heavy metal ("The main focus and theme of heavy-metal is a 'drugs, sex,
rock 'n' roll' defiance of authority and/or a 'Live for today'
attitude"), it even details the latest dress codes (chains, spikes, and
studs are "becoming passe in the changing course of punk fashions,"
notes a segment on "Dress and Accessories").  In addition, Pettinicchio
names punk and metal magazines, explains street slang ("Gig:  a place
where punk rockers go to see a punk band play") and exhaustively lists
bands, which are conveniently broken down into categories like Political
Punk, Occult Punk, Pop Metal, Punk Metal, and Weirdos.
   However, the lion's share of the handbook is devoted to the nuts and
bolts of satanism.  Included are such features as "Devil Players
Glossery" (sic), a calendar of "Satanic Holy Days", a readers' guide to
both "Occult Codes" and "The Witch's Alphabet" and a handy, six-point
check list titled "Common Signs of Possible Involvement in Devil-Play".
In this final section, which carries the disclaimer that "just because a
youngster may be involved in...the following activites does not
necessarily mean he-she is involved in occult-devil worship", parents
are advised to keep an eye ut for such telltale misconduct as animal
mutilations, graveyard desecrations and homicides.
   ...
   The section on "Signs and Symbols of Heavy Metal" is especially
enlightening.  A peace symbol, for instance, is identified as "a broken
cross...upside down with arms broken to mock Christianity".  Of course,
not everyone who employs the emblem is demonically inclined, admits
Pettinicchio.  "An old hippie who does that", she allows, "probably
doesn't have [mocking Christianity] in mind."
   Also on the list of suspicious symbols is the Jewish Star of David,
which, Pettinicchio points out, can also be considered a hexagram.
   ...
   By far the most sensational chapter of the parental pamphlet is the
satanic "glossery", in which Pettinicchio addresses such alleged
phenomena as the cremation of young victims ("usually in association
with an adult satanist"), and the use of the "evil eye" by adolescent
witches and warlocks.  But the practice of such antisocial after-school
hobbies is only the tip of the pitchfork, notes Pettinicchio.
   "In our area, we had one group that was boiling fetuses to make wax
candles," she notes matter of factly, adding that opening of graves to
pilfer body parts also is a popular pastime among certain cults.  "To
have a human skull at a ritual, that's the ultimate", she explains.
"And sometimes you need a left hand.  Where are you gonna get a left
hand?"
   Pettinicchio, not surprisingly, offers precious little documentation
for such allegations--in fact, the handbook cites not a single source
for its spectacular accounts of music-related devilment.  The book, for
instance, claims that "numerous parents, siblings and peers have been
murdered by heavy-metal satanists through the United States and
Canada"--but fails to mention any of the victims by name or provide any
details of the alleged headbanger homicides.
   "There are articles, newspaper articles about this", argues
Pettinicchio.  In addition, adds the counselor, much of her information
is gathered firsthand from the young Lucifer lovers she deprograms.
   The book's lack of substantiation for its tales from the dark side
isn't the only reason parents may find it less than authoritative.
   For one thing, the book charges that the initals of the band W.A.S.P.
stand for "We Are Satan's People", when in fact the group claims the
insect acronym is short for "We Are Sexual Perverts".  Also, mom and pop
might have trouble convincing junior that such mainstream acts as Billy
Idol and Devo are "weirdos" that should be avoided at all costs.
   Numerous spelling errors could further complicate things.  The
handbook calls Husker Du "Huskerdo", labels the metal band Anthrax
"Anthray", and calls Metallica "Metellica".
   And the members of the band Dokken might well bray in disbelief if
they find out they've been renamed "Donkken".
   Those are mere typos, responds Pettinicchio, who says she's preparing
a second printing that will eliminate the errata.  She's already sold
roughly 400 handbooks by mail order at 5 bucks a pop, she adds--and she
expects to sell many more.
   Pettinicchio seems sincere in her concern for children--and she takes
pains to stress that only a fraction of the teens who listen to punk or
heavy metal wind up singing the praises of Hades.  Still, she says,
rigid discipline before trouble starts can make "depunking" or
"demetaling" unnecessary.  The handbook, for example, recommends that
parents levy an in-house ban on music, haircuts or paraphernalia that
might be construed as satanic--and that teens not be allowed to attend
punk or metal concerts.
   "Kids are desperately seeking those kinds of controls", says
Pettinicchio.  And she warns, "If parents don't set limits for their
kids, someone else will."

Sounds to me like this woman and Pastor Brothers are in league with each
other.
