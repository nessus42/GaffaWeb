&gt;&gt;&gt; The way I heard it, all shows were done in New York.  Several rehearsals
&gt;&gt;&gt; were done to get the mixes down before the shows were put before a live
&gt;&gt;&gt; audience.  When the people came into the auditorium for the show, they
&gt;&gt;&gt; were handed a handwritten note (or copies) asking them to keep absolutely
&gt;&gt;&gt; quiet until each song was completely finished.  All songs, if I remember
&gt;&gt;&gt; rightly, except for "Man in the Street" which was recorded during a
&gt;&gt;&gt; rehearsal session, went straight from the stage onto the master digital
&gt;&gt;&gt; recording, and I believe no mixing took place after the shows.
&gt;
&gt;None of this is true; he held some of these shows in Southern New
&gt;Jersey (for Philadelphia fans), in Boston, and in other places.  As
&gt;part of one of his New York audiences, I can say that we didn't know a
&gt;THING about the fact that he was taping his music live.  
&gt;
&gt;I don't think a performer has a right to inflict such bullshit on an
&gt;audience; if he wanted to have quiet he should record in a studio.

I saw Joe Jackson in January in a suburban Philadelphia niteclub.  The
audience here was not given any notes, but Joe repeatedly asked for
quiet.  I think this just made the audience more unruly.  I don't think
that any of the recordings he made that day ended up on the final album.
He set was comprised of all the new stuff as well as some old favorites.

The cocert was so electrifying that my friends and I weren't too upset
about Joe's request for quiet.  The club was small, the tickets were cheap,
the seating was great, and Joe had the place on fire!
