SUCK !!!
 they suck so damn bad you can taste 'em !!!

I saw SP back in november of last year.  They had a stage full of shit
that they toyed with.  If I remember right, they had two synths and a
drummer of some sort.  they all look like strung out herion addicts from
rich wittle families who had lots of money for haircuts and black
clothes and white make up for there face.   but they were still lousy,
no matter what some simmering little wimp of a californicator wil say
otherwise.   He's porobably got his nose up some line of coke as he sits
in some wanker-esque hottub and drinks his wine cooler with his hair-cut
girlfriend as they listen to wanker cure album.

`Skinny Puppy took longer to clear their shit off the stage as they did
to play.  Fog Machine, Dry Ice, fake blood, fake pain, FAKE DEATHROCK. 
IF THEY WANT TO FUCKING DO DEATHROCK, WHY DON'T THEY DO DIE ????

and BESIDES the point, Volcano Suns came in after them and proceeded not
only to make fun of them ("ohh ohh I'm bleeding I'm dying..what I can't
die ?? cause I'm not a deathrocker ?? aww shucks")  but to "shreds their
faces, rape their asses and cum in their mouths."  

take this non-deathrocker-herion addict-haircut-kinda guy's advice and
avoid these people.  at all costs. They'd probably rape your cat if your
not looking.  I know I would if I was them (and I'm thankful I'm not).

shit, even Waurie Anderson beats these clods
