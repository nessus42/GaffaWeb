&gt; Please don't tempt IED into another Dreaming vs. Hounds of Love
&gt; debate!!!

But I just won't settle for such heresy!!!!!  I WON'T.  This is not a
matter of debate.  This is a matter of undeniable religious FACT!
*The Dreaming* is the greatest album that ever was and that ever will
be.  Those who take *The Dreaming* as their personal saviour will
achieve eternal life.  Those who don't are doomed to eternal damnation
with a tape loop of "Dress You Up in My Love" playing!!!  Death to
heathen unbelievers!  Praise Kate!  Amen!  Amen!

&gt; 1) Which is more industrial, Throbbing Gristle or Einsturzende
&gt; Neubauten?

Einsturzende.  When have they *ever* done anything with a melody or
without clanking metal?

&gt; 2) Which is more satanic, Diamanda Galas or Current 93?

Never heard Current 93, but I'd like to take this oportunity to say
that Diamanda Galas sounds like what Kate Bush would sound like if she
were the Anti-Christ.  Buy an album of hers, or Jesus will come and
take you to a land where all is merry and good and nobody ever talks
to loud and the shuffle board courts are always kept in good shape.

3) Which is more psychedelic, Fuzztones or Dukes of the Stratosphere?

I dunno.

4) Which is more drug-damaged, Butthole Surfers or Scratch Acid?

No one is more drug damaged that the Butthole Surfers.  Except Wickinski.

5) Which is harder on the guitars, Sonic Youth or Swans?

Well, when I saw Sonic Youth, the guitarist broke the head off his
guitar, so I gotta vote for them.  The Swans did a good job on their
bass, but only managed to break a string.  Sonic Youth look like a
bunch of nurdly high school kids making this incredible racket,
though, while The Swans were scarier than *The Alien*....  The Swans
are definitely harder on the nerves.

6) Which is more "classical", Laibach or Univers Zero?

Classic Coke.

7) Which is more wimpy, Wimpy Houston or Lionel Wimpie?

Lionel Wimpie, but lets not quible over minor details.

8) Which is more slutty, Madonna or Cyndi Lauper?

Madonna.  Cyndi Lauper actually has a sense of humor.  I mean, you
just can't hate someone too much who had a hit song all about the
joys of masterbation.

9) Which is more abrasive, Jim Hofmann or Tim Wicinski? :-)

Great taste!  Less filling!   Great taste!  Less filling! ...

&gt; 10) Which is more macho, the pineapple or the knife?

The pineapple.  What do I win????

			&gt;oug

"Westron wynde when wyll thow blow
 The smalle rayne downe can rayne
 Chryst yf my love wer in my armys
 and I yn my bed agayne"
