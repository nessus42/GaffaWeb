&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Joe Jackson  "Big World"
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Started out brilliantly, a fusion of his early guitar-based energy and
&gt; &gt;&gt; later musical sophistication, but lost me somewhere along the line.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'll have to listen to it some more (just got it today) to really be
&gt; &gt;&gt; able to grok its fullness.  (Love the DDD sound, tho.)
&gt; 
&gt; The best part about this album is the environment in which it was
&gt; produced.  Jackson held several unannounced (more-or-less) concerts
&gt; across the country, and attempted to make the album by taking down the
&gt; music live at the concert.  All fine and good, except he kept shushing
&gt; up the audience ... 
&gt; 
&gt; Saw 'im in New York,
&gt; -- Henri / &lt;henry@athena.mit.edu&gt;

The way I heard it, all shows were done in New York.  Several rehearsals
were done to get the mixes down before the shows were put before a live
audience.  When the people came into the auditorium for the show, they
were handed a handwritten note (or copies) asking them to keep absolutely
quiet until each song was completely finished.  All songs, if I remember
rightly, except for "Man in the Street" which was recorded during a
rehearsal session, went straight from the stage onto the master digital
recording, and I believe no mixing took place after the shows.

The sound quality stands up quite well against "Body &amp; Soul", which
I think is also DDD.
