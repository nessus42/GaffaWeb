[x] I'm sorry, Doug, but I can't go out to dinner with you because

	[x] I don't go out with strangers.
	[x] you're too interesting, and I don't want to
            be overshadowed.
	[x] other: 	Um, well, I'm male and hetro. 
			And the cab-fare from San Jose.....

I'm replying because I don't know how to post to mod.music.gaffa.  

[You mail it off to gaffa-post@mit-eddie.  -- Doug]

As KT would say:

	Help me, help me, please please help me.

I'm desperate; I loved the stuff about Waking the Witch etc, so I went
out and bought The Dreaming, and I'm going to go stark! raving! mad! 
if I don't get some answers!!!!  My continued sanity is in your hands! 
(better wash them afterward).

Heaven vs Hell?  Whose face on the 10 schilling note?
Silver Buddha and Silver Bullet?  Until the hide's ready for you?
We let the Madness in?  And push'em from the pull-a-the-Bush?
A higher place over the border?  Who is this Paul she's singing to?
Did he get the message through or not?  With my keeper I?

[Doug answers: (1) The song is about the quest for knowledge.  One
problem is how can you *know* anything when one person's truth is
another's fiction, and vice versa, etc. (2) One of the great unknown
mysteries of life.  (3) Many Viet Cong would wear a little silver
Buddha on a chain around their necks.  When they went into battle,
they would put the Buddha in their mouths so that if they died, they
would die with Bhuddha on their lips.  (4)  You got the lyrics wrong,
but "Suspended in Gaffa" is another song about the quest for
knowledge, perfection, or whatever.  She uses the image of God as
something that people feel they have to be worthy of before they can
obtain what they want.  Not until she is ready for Him, not until she
has worked hard enough and is pure, can she have it all.  (5) It's
actually "We let the Weirdness in".  Kate thinks we should all be open
to new and strange phenomena.  (6)  This song is about the plight of
the Aborigine in Australia.  The white man pushes them from their
homes and destroys their land to dig for Uranium.  Devils-in-a-bottle
(alcohol) destroy their traditional way of life and also pull them
from the bush (their traditional home).  (7)  Your lyrics aren't quite
right, but "Night of the Swallow" is a duet (though Kate sings both
voices) between a man and his lover.  He wants to go do some smuggling
to add excitement to his life, but she doesn't want him to go.  "Would
you break even my wings, like a swallow."  "But you're not a swallow".
(8) Paul?  Who's Paul?  She's singing to all the people she loves.
(9) In the song he does.  In real life, Houdini's wife thought he had,
but then later figured out that it was a hoax.  (10) This song is
about a woman who has been left by her lover.  She starts visualizing
her body and herself as a haunted house a la *The Shining*.

Any archived stuff about The Dreaming to save me posting redundant 
questions?  Thanks!

[There's probably many hundreds of K of stuff buried somewhere in the
archives!  I don't wanna dig it all out right now, but anyone can call
the Kate Bush Information and Song Interpretation Hotline (that's me)
at 617-354-6403 (work) or 617-354-6403 (home).

Post script:  
	A friend just bought L-H album, and says he will do a backward tape
	of it for me.  I can't wait to hear it!
