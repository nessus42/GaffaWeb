Greg Earle sez:

&gt;&gt;the record came out a lot more, um, accessible than I thought it would.
&gt;I never said otherwise.  Remember, judge not by one single record (out of
&gt;11 records, see below).  It is definitely more `accessible' than their other
&gt;efforts, yet does not cross the border into pandering to commercial interests.
&gt;Still not K-RAK fodder ...

You're right.  And I've decided I do like it.

&gt;&gt;(So what are Skinny Puppy like, Greg?)
&gt;Like Severed Heads with more prominent drum machine and the aforementioned
&gt;CV derived vocals.  Shit, spend some money, find out for yourself ...

True.  But I like to have some idea of what I'm getting into before I plop
down 8 bux at leat for an import LP.  Plus, I haven't actually SEEN any
Skinny Puppy stuff yet.

[Not me:]&gt;&gt;By the way what is this "Red Mecca" thing that everyone keeps
&gt;&gt;bagging.
&gt;Cabaret Voltaire's 4th LP, released in 1981

4th?  I count "Live YMCA", "Voice of America", "Red Mecca".  Must be missing
one.

&gt;&gt;[Alfke again]
&gt;&gt;Well, some more new records but little time to write...
&gt;&gt;Hula  "1000 Hours"

&gt;??? Hate to be a weenie and Pick Nits but I've had this for 8 months !?!?

Couple weeks ago some net.music guy pointed out how groovy it would be if
we all reviewed (in some sense) the records we bought.  I've done a few
of these things, and have never claimed that these are NEW records, just
that I only recently bought them.  Hell, "Big World" has been out since
June or so.

&gt;I would hardly call Hula `industrial' either ("Sheffield's reigning
&gt;industrial kings"), nor would I say "Chris and Cosey ... are going downhill"
&gt;[do you have `Take Five'?]

Words words words.  I like to call them industrial, since they agree with
my idea of what "industrial" means.  Noise, tapes, drones ... is Will
Sergeant's "Themes for 'Grind'" industrial?

Mebbe I'm lame but I think I raved about this way back in January or Feb...
Oh well I guess no one listens to me anyways ..

Greg, guess why I bought it.  I do remember when people rave about things,
particularly when they seem to have tastes that agree with mine.  Just
took a while for it to surface (friend played "Get the Habit" for me the
other month) and to actually find the damn thing, as I can't bop down to
Melrose every weekend.

And speaking of the Slacks, sorry to announce that I gave "Nausea" a good
listen and didn't like it.  I will make no judgments of the record itself,
they seem to be making valid music, I just don't care for it one way or
the other.  Now if they'd go back to making stuff like "The Bus" or "Cinema"
again ...

[And off the subject, for those who care the CD of the Velvets' "VU" is
missing the guitar lick that comes a few seconds before "Foggy Notion",
which incidentally remains one of the best dance songs ever.  And while
I'm at it may I plug the album for those fools who haven't heard it; it
is my fave Velvets album, surpassing even "&amp; Nico".  Ahem.]
