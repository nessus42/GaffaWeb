*****  MACHINE WANNA EAT ANOTHER COOKIE?  *****

  In a couple of articles mem@sii.UUCP writes:
&gt; [...]
&gt; perhaps the name of the fifth album, `So', might be the fifth character
&gt; of some alphabet.  And it is..  do, re, me, fa, so, la, ti, do.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;However, my dictionary says that both "so" and "sol" are correct. [...]
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;-mm-

  Neither mem@sii nor I have read anything on the naming of Peter
  Gabriel's latest album... so if this has alread been discussed,
  sorry gang.  Now into the storm...

  Music means a great deal to my friends and I.  Fortunately a couple
  of my best friends work where I do and we get into some long rap
  sessions concerning music and music makers.  Well, they know more
  about it than I do so I derive much from them; this is how I came
  across another idea on the naming of Peter (PG) Gabriel's fourth and
  fifth albums.
  -------------------------
  Once PG had changed from one record label (can't remember which off
  hand) to Geffen, the big boys decided that he wasn't going to
  contine with his antics any longer of simply naming the "Peter
  Gabriel".  As I understand it he originally intended never to give a
  title to any record, rather keep a singular title as a form of
  annual 'magazine.'  Geffen didn't like the idea saying it would be
  too confusing to the consumer.  (They take us for idiots or what?)

      [ FOLLOWING CONVERSATIONS ARE CONJECTURE BASED ON RUMOR ]

  GEFFEN:  Peter, we think it's time you started putting names on
           your albums like eveyone else.
  GABRIEL: But I like what I'm doing, it's unique yet simple.
  GEFFEN:  It won't do, we need a name that's more solid, something
           with a little security.
  GABRIEL: That's a good one, use it.
  GEFFEN:  Use what?
  GABRIEL: Security. Bye.

      [ WANT MORE?  HERE YOU GO... ]

  GEFFEN:  Well, this just about wraps up another session.  By the
           way, have you thought up a name for this one?
  GABRIEL: Oh, you want another one?  How about Peter Gabr...
  GEFFEN:  Er, sorry, that's already beem used.  Remember?  We need
           another one.
  GABRIEL: So?
  GEFFEN:  (Pauses recalling last discussion)  Hmm, not bad.
  -------------------------
  I think the names should have been swapped considering the change in
  style and presentation from Security to So.  His fourth album was
  more of the style from before.  Not paying heed to the producers, he
  continued with his music as he saw fit, not by their visions.
  Security on the other hand was more of a change from what we were
  used to from him.  To me the sound was a bit more of the type the
  radio stations would gobble up and over-play on the air.  Not saying
  he's become commercial, just changed.  I think it was done for his
  own security; we hadn't heard from him in so long.  Taking different
  directions with his sound he put out something he enjoyed.

  In my eyes PGIV should have been So
         and PGV  should have been Security.

  But it's too late and I've rambled too long with my opinions.
  Hopefully someone out there is able to make sense of all this...
