&gt; 
&gt; Now that the new Love-Hounds video collection is starting to become available
&gt; to people, IED thought some of you might want 
&gt; to know a little about its contents. 
&gt; 
&gt;   1.  Top  of  the  Pops,  February  1978: "Wuthering Heights" (lip-synch  at
&gt;  the  piano).
&gt;   
&gt; Now you know why IED was asking all those boring follow-up questions about
&gt; the various "Wuthering Heights" performances from the old Top of the Pops
&gt; programme on UK TV from 1978.  The first clip on the new tape is the TotP
&gt; "piano version", which, as far as IED is aware, has not been available in the
&gt; U.S. before.  
&gt;        
&gt;   2.  Fruitopia  ad  No.  1a: "Summer Solstice".
&gt; 
&gt; This tape's original raison-d'etre was the collection of all of Kate Bush's
&gt; Fruitopia spots in one place, in order to make the music available to any
&gt; Kate Bush fan who wanted it.  This is one of the first spots to be broadcast
&gt; in the U.S. -- a longer, widescreen version of the same spot was the first
&gt; seen in theaters (it is included toward the end of this tape). The tape
&gt; gathers a total of ten different Kate Bush Fruitopia "scores":  "Summer
&gt; Solstice", "Nice", "Fighting Fruit", "Soul", "Thirsty", "Skin", "Person",
&gt; "Passion", "Where Were You?", and "Some People", as
&gt; well as the Japanese "Summer Solstice" and the sixty-second version, called
&gt; "What If?").  Of these, only "Some People" is 
&gt; a "new" ad -- that is, not among the initial batch of Fruitopia spots.  It
&gt; promotes the newer, lighter-tasting line of drinks, including the Iced Teas.
&gt;  Although other "new" spots have aired for these new flavors, this is the
&gt; only one that features new Kate Bush music -- all of the others just recycle
&gt; older scores with new graphics.
&gt; 
&gt; Six of the ten Fruitopia spots in this collection come from a promotional
&gt; tape that Karen Newcombe snagged for us.  The balance were taken off U.S. TV.
&gt; 
&gt;   3.  The  Seventh  Annual  Tokyo  Song  Festival, June  1978: "Moving" (live
&gt; performance).
&gt;   4.  Sound  in  'S' (Japan),  June  1978:  "She's Leaving Home",   "The
&gt;  Long  and  Winding  Road", "Let It  Be",  "Rolling  the  Ball" [sic) (live
&gt; performances).
&gt;   5.  Fruitopia  ad No.  1b ("Summer Solstice",  Japan).
&gt; 
&gt; These Japanese clips are among the most entertaining of all
&gt; Kate Bush artifacts.  We have Sozo Yamamoto to thank for the
&gt; much improved picture quality of the present copies, as well
&gt; as for the wonderful 15-second Japanese edition of the Fruitopia 
&gt; "Summer Solstice" spot.
&gt;   
&gt;   6.  Parodies, 1978-1979.  
&gt; 
&gt; The first of these is an interview with Kate Bush in which she watches and
&gt; comments on Faith Brown's  parody  of  the Rockflix "Wuthering Heights"
&gt; video;  this is followed by Brown's parody of  "Wow" (to which is appended a
&gt; relevant clip from "Musical Chairs", a BBC film about Keith MacMillan's
&gt; videos),  Brown's "interview"  with "Kate Bush" and her performance of the
&gt; old pop standard, "Three Little Fishes"; and finally, Pamela  Stephenson's
&gt; "Oh, England, My Leotard", a parody from "Not the Nine O'Clock News", 1979.
&gt;  
&gt;    8.  Fantastico (Italy) :   "Cloudbusting",  1985. 
&gt; 
&gt; This lip-synch is the only Kate Bush performance of this song of
&gt; "Cloudbusting" other than the original.
&gt; 
&gt; 10. Don't Give Up, 1986.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a montage of the two official Peter Gabriel videos, merging the live
&gt; audio-track from the only performance Kate Bush has given of  "Don't Give Up"
&gt; to date (London, 1987) with parts of the two official Peter Gabriel videos of
&gt; the song.
&gt; 
&gt; 12. This Is Your Life (Nigel Kennedy), 1990.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a brief clip showing Kate Bush's guest spot on an episode of the
&gt; long-running British version of this old TV show. In this episode the
&gt; "victim" was Nigel Kennedy, and Kate appears very briefly.
&gt; 
&gt; 14. The Wogan Show: "Rocket Man", 1990 (lip-synch.).
&gt; 
&gt; 15. "Rocket Man" ad (UK TV).
&gt; 
&gt; 16. The Last Show on Earth (titles), 1992.  
&gt; 
&gt; This is just the title sequence of a U.S. documentary that was aired on
&gt; Public Television in 1992, using a large part of Kate's "Hello Earth" as the
&gt; soundtrack.
&gt; 
&gt; 18.  The  London  Film  Festival.
&gt;   
&gt; This is the first bit of unofficial, fan-generated video of Kate Bush that
&gt; IED has ever encountered.  It shows Kate introducing  the premiere of "The
&gt; Line,  The Cross,  and the Curve" at the British Film Festival, 1994.
&gt; 
&gt; 20.  MTV: "Rubberband  Girl", the alternate, or "MTV" version,  1994.
&gt; 
&gt; 22.  Top of the Pops: "And So Is Love", 1994 (lip-synch).
&gt; 
&gt; One of the best latter-years performances, in IED's opinion -- given that
&gt; these are collectively characterized by a relative lack of commitment and
&gt; choreographic prep-work by Kate Bush, this one at least is expressively
&gt; static and spare.
&gt;  
&gt; 24.  Kate Bush, with Larry  Adler: "The  Man  I Love" (video for  "The Glory
&gt;  of  Gershwin", 1994).
&gt; 
&gt; 26.  "RockPop" (Netherlands):  "Babooshka" and 
&gt;         "Army Dreamers" ("Mrs Mop"), 1980 (lip-synchs.).
&gt; 
&gt; The "Mrs Mop" (Mopp?) performance is included here (out of chronological
&gt; order) mainly because it's one of IED's favorites.
&gt; We're fortunate to have this improved copy from Love-Hound Marcel Rijs.
&gt;  
&gt; 27.  The Seiko commercial (1978). Apart from the Fruitopia spots and the
&gt; various TV ads for Kate Bush's own releases, this is the only advertisement
&gt; she has done to date. It aired on Japanese TV, and as far as IED is aware,
&gt; this crummy copy is the best one available so far.
&gt; 
&gt; 29.  "May I ask you what you're doing?":  a short film by John Light. 
&gt; 
&gt; This compilation was the result of a collaboration by IED (Andrew Marvick),
&gt; John Light and Karen Newcombe, but we couldn't have done it without the help
&gt; of a lot of other generous and talented folks, most of whom are credited at
&gt; the end of the tape. 
&gt; 
&gt; We hope you enjoy it!!
&gt;

Is this tape available on PAL format?
