<PRE>
Now that the new Love-Hounds video collection is starting to become available
to people, IED thought some of you might want 
to know a little about its contents. 

  1.  Top  of  the  Pops,  February  1978: "Wuthering Heights" (lip-synch  at
 the  piano).
  
Now you know why IED was asking all those boring follow-up questions about
the various "Wuthering Heights" performances from the old Top of the Pops
programme on UK TV from 1978.  The first clip on the new tape is the TotP
"piano version", which, as far as IED is aware, has not been available in the
U.S. before.  
       
  2.  Fruitopia  ad  No.  1a: "Summer Solstice".

This tape's original raison-d'etre was the collection of all of Kate Bush's
Fruitopia spots in one place, in order to make the music available to any
Kate Bush fan who wanted it.  This is one of the first spots to be broadcast
in the U.S. -- a longer, widescreen version of the same spot was the first
seen in theaters (it is included toward the end of this tape). The tape
gathers a total of ten different Kate Bush Fruitopia "scores":  "Summer
Solstice", "Nice", "Fighting Fruit", "Soul", "Thirsty", "Skin", "Person",
"Passion", "Where Were You?", and "Some People", as
well as the Japanese "Summer Solstice" and the sixty-second version, called
"What If?").  Of these, only "Some People" is 
a "new" ad -- that is, not among the initial batch of Fruitopia spots.  It
promotes the newer, lighter-tasting line of drinks, including the Iced Teas.
 Although other "new" spots have aired for these new flavors, this is the
only one that features new Kate Bush music -- all of the others just recycle
older scores with new graphics.

Six of the ten Fruitopia spots in this collection come from a promotional
tape that Karen Newcombe snagged for us.  The balance were taken off U.S. TV.

  3.  The  Seventh  Annual  Tokyo  Song  Festival, June  1978: "Moving" (live
performance).
  4.  Sound  in  'S' (Japan),  June  1978:  "She's Leaving Home",   "The
 Long  and  Winding  Road", "Let It  Be",  "Rolling  the  Ball" [sic) (live
performances).
  5.  Fruitopia  ad No.  1b ("Summer Solstice",  Japan).

These Japanese clips are among the most entertaining of all
Kate Bush artifacts.  We have Sozo Yamamoto to thank for the
much improved picture quality of the present copies, as well
as for the wonderful 15-second Japanese edition of the Fruitopia 
"Summer Solstice" spot.
  
  6.  Parodies, 1978-1979.  

The first of these is an interview with Kate Bush in which she watches and
comments on Faith Brown's  parody  of  the Rockflix "Wuthering Heights"
video;  this is followed by Brown's parody of  "Wow" (to which is appended a
relevant clip from "Musical Chairs", a BBC film about Keith MacMillan's
videos),  Brown's "interview"  with "Kate Bush" and her performance of the
old pop standard, "Three Little Fishes"; and finally, Pamela  Stephenson's
"Oh, England, My Leotard", a parody from "Not the Nine O'Clock News", 1979.
 
   8.  Fantastico (Italy) :   "Cloudbusting",  1985. 

This lip-synch is the only Kate Bush performance of this song of
"Cloudbusting" other than the original.

10. Don't Give Up, 1986.

This is a montage of the two official Peter Gabriel videos, merging the live
audio-track from the only performance Kate Bush has given of  "Don't Give Up"
to date (London, 1987) with parts of the two official Peter Gabriel videos of
the song.

12. This Is Your Life (Nigel Kennedy), 1990.

This is a brief clip showing Kate Bush's guest spot on an episode of the
long-running British version of this old TV show. In this episode the
"victim" was Nigel Kennedy, and Kate appears very briefly.

14. The Wogan Show: "Rocket Man", 1990 (lip-synch.).

15. "Rocket Man" ad (UK TV).

16. The Last Show on Earth (titles), 1992.  

This is just the title sequence of a U.S. documentary that was aired on
Public Television in 1992, using a large part of Kate's "Hello Earth" as the
soundtrack.

18.  The  London  Film  Festival.
  
This is the first bit of unofficial, fan-generated video of Kate Bush that
IED has ever encountered.  It shows Kate introducing  the premiere of "The
Line,  The Cross,  and the Curve" at the British Film Festival, 1994.

20.  MTV: "Rubberband  Girl", the alternate, or "MTV" version,  1994.

22.  Top of the Pops: "And So Is Love", 1994 (lip-synch).

One of the best latter-years performances, in IED's opinion -- given that
these are collectively characterized by a relative lack of commitment and
choreographic prep-work by Kate Bush, this one at least is expressively
static and spare.
 
24.  Kate Bush, with Larry  Adler: "The  Man  I Love" (video for  "The Glory
 of  Gershwin", 1994).

26.  "RockPop" (Netherlands):  "Babooshka" and 
        "Army Dreamers" ("Mrs Mop"), 1980 (lip-synchs.).

The "Mrs Mop" (Mopp?) performance is included here (out of chronological
order) mainly because it's one of IED's favorites.
We're fortunate to have this improved copy from Love-Hound Marcel Rijs.
 
27.  The Seiko commercial (1978). Apart from the Fruitopia spots and the
various TV ads for Kate Bush's own releases, this is the only advertisement
she has done to date. It aired on Japanese TV, and as far as IED is aware,
this crummy copy is the best one available so far.

29.  "May I ask you what you're doing?":  a short film by John Light. 

This compilation was the result of a collaboration by IED (Andrew Marvick),
John Light and Karen Newcombe, but we couldn't have done it without the help
of a lot of other generous and talented folks, most of whom are credited at
the end of the tape. 

We hope you enjoy it!!
