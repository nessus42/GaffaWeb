&gt;&gt; And what do YOU know about high school dropout Diana that makes you think

&gt;&gt;
&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong (and I know you will) but didn't Kate drop out
&gt;of school as well?  Multiple 0 levels notwithstanding, does this in some
&gt;way diminish her contributions in your eyes?

No. Your selective quoting left out an important part of my point. I
pointed out that Kate has gone on to do more important things than smiling
prettily for photo-ops and taking up political causes (land mines) that she
surely knows nothing about (she was coached on this by a guy from the Red
Cross, I believe).

I don't care if you dropped out of JUNIOR high school, but you better have
some examples of your ability to use your brain if you want to be
considered anything other than "a cutesy airhead" of either gender.

&gt;As to the favorite album cover poll (good thread Don), "Lionheart" beats
&gt;out "The Dreaming" by .00001 points.  I just love the lighting and
&gt;composition of the front photograph.  Least favorite is "The Red
&gt;Shoes".  Yes, it is a good concept, and it does relate to the title
&gt;track, but I remember the pang of disappointment I felt when I got it
&gt;because there was no current picture of Kate.   She is one of those
&gt;women that has gotten more beautiful with age, but pictures of her from
&gt;the last decade are rare indeed.

I haven't chimed in on that thread. I'm still thinking about it.

&gt; Someone please call EMI and tell them
&gt;that the new album should include a 20 page photo booklet, as well as a
&gt;companion 2 hour interview/performance video.  Just saying it could even
&gt;make it happen.

Why not think big? I think that Kate should come over to my house and put
the CD in my CD player for me.
