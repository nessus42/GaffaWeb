when kate sings 'no stranger's feet will enter me' in 'get out of my
house' definitely gives me a chill whenever i hear it

&gt; Hiya folks,
&gt;  I've got a question for you that maybe you've never asked yourselves about
&gt; Kate's music... What single line of a Kate song (vocally) has caused the
&gt; most intense reaction? The biggest chill to roll through you as if
&gt; threatening never to let go...
&gt; 
&gt; I though of that just recently when I was watch the Line, the Cross, and
&gt; the Curve...she hits a distinctively Kate note in And So Is Love that had
&gt; me (grown man that I am) shivering... predictably it was the last very
&gt; soulful iteration of the title line.
&gt; 
&gt; Other times it's happened to me?
&gt; at the end of the Big Sky where she hits that unbelievable screech,
&gt; sustains it and pulls it down into a deep rip that sounds way too rich to
&gt; be some white woman.
&gt; 
&gt; in This Woman's Work (with the help of the exquisite string arrangement)
&gt; Ohhh darlin, make them go away.
&gt; 
&gt; During her duet with Peter Gabriel, doing Another Day, pretty much the
&gt; whole thing, really, but the very end... and I walk away
&gt; 
&gt; During Under the Ivy, perhaps the strongest response of them all, just
&gt; because of the emotion range in the one segment
&gt; and it's not easy for me
&gt; to give away your secret
&gt; It's not safe
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, so these are mostly the sad moments, but hearing Kate tug at my soul
&gt; has always been more a pleasure than most other musicians could provoke
&gt; from me in their most brilliant moments.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd really love to hear from you, hear what moments do it to you.
