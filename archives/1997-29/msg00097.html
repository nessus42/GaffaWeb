&gt;&gt;Did you know that when she took her sons to see AIDS patients that this
&gt;&gt;paragon of virtue told her sons the people had cancer...not AIDS? What do
&gt;&gt;you think about that?
&gt;
&gt;Is this true?!  I kind of doubt it.  How old were her sons at the
&gt;time?  Maybe they were very young?
&gt;
   I am not sure of the EXACT circumstances surrounding this situation,
but I have known SEVERAL people with AIDS, some where considered good
friends. While they indeed had AIDS, the virus often caused cancers that
were visible, often on the face. As a mother of a young child, if my son
asked why does a person look a certain way? I would reply that the person
had cancer, not AIDS. It is complicated to explain AIDS, when it IS
actually cancer a child is seeing. 
   Diane was not a paragon a virtue, and she would never claim to be. But
she did bring an awareness to the issue of AIDS, and helped raise money for
the cause. I think the author, (FASTLOW) is being rather petty, and snippy
over someone who is dead. 

BACK TO KATE, PLEASE....
                                                       Mary
