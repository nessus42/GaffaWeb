&gt;OK...it's my birthday and I got $70 worth of gift certificates to my fave
&gt;music store.  Now, I have EVERYTHING by Kate (except the HoL re-release,
&gt;but I do have the Japanese Box...so, that one is on the back burner.  If I
&gt;DID get the re-release, I wouldn't open it and I just get it as a novelty
&gt;item) BUT they do have about 6 CD's by Ms. Rhodes, whom I have never heard?
&gt; Should I try her out?  What does she sound like?  Which one should I start
&gt;with?  
&gt;

    I am new to the HAPPY scene, but I was soooooo impressed by her that
my husband and I drove ten hours to see her live in Philly, last March. I
own WARPAINT, and ECTO, both are excellent, (Warpaint over Ecto though). I
have heard Happy as refered to Kate Bush on ENO, I find that to be a very
accurate description. 
    At first, we laughed over Happy, she was sooooooo much like Kate. We
would say, oh this is her "Lioheart" song, etc...but after repeated
listenings, like Kate she grows on you, and you begin to appreciate her on
her own. NOW I think she is similar, but yet very very different from Kate.
She is a nice supplement to Kate, since Kate does not crank out the albums. 
   I have written Happy on AOL, and she has written back. The concert was
worth the drive, and she was very entertaining. 
   I have had a friend make some tapes for me of the rest of Happy's work,
since her CDs can be hard to find. I do hope to own all her works someday.
Look at the ECTO website for more information. 
   Hope that helps...
                                  Mary
