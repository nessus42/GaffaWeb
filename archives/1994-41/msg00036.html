&gt;&gt;     Are you saying that if your wife/girlfriend/sister got
&gt;&gt;involved with someone of a dubious nature you'd just say "she's a big
&gt;&gt;girl" and turn your back on her?
&gt;
&gt;Kate is none of those things to me, nor in any other way my intimate
&gt;friend.

I'm afraid that kind of attitude is the reason the world of today is
in such a mess.  Why should our concern be limited to a small
circle of intimate friends and family?  

&gt;
&gt;That being the case, I have no business having more than perhaps a
&gt;faint disapproval of her association with someone who hasn't even
&gt;been demonstrated to have any negative effect on her.

You don't work for the government by any chance? :-)
Our government adopts the same attitude over potential hazards such
as BSE (mad cow disease.)  Since it has yet to be *proven* harmful,
nothing needs to be done about it.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;                                      We may have no influence
&gt;&gt;over what KaTe does with her life, but we still have a right to be
&gt;&gt;concerned about someone we care about.
&gt;
&gt;If you claim to care about Kate as much as you would a wife/sister/etc
&gt;*without knowing her personally*, you would do better to be concerned
&gt;about yourself.

Hee hee, no I don't rise to the bait that easily.  That is *not*
what I was saying as you know full well.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Whether Lily is a bad influence is open to debate, but the
&gt;&gt;possibility that she *may* be a bad influence should concern
&gt;&gt;anyone who cares about KaTe.
&gt;
&gt;Obviously some people have made up their minds to more than simply
&gt;"she *may* be a bad influence".  It was primarily in that direction
&gt;that my comments were directed.  If someone were to post with something
&gt;appearing to be *proof* that Kate was being duped by some fraud (say,
&gt;on the level of the Maharishi &amp; the Beatles), I'd be concerned enough
&gt;to say "someone should try to point this out to her".  But it would
&gt;still not be MY place to point it out, nor would it be MY place to
&gt;get on any moral high horses about it.

The sad fact is that most of the rest of the world thinks the same
way you do (and I'm as guilty as anyone, before you put me on a
moral high horse.)  "It's not down to ME to do something about it"
is a common cry, but we ALL ought to be concerned about our fellow
inhabitants of this planet.  And in case you were wondering, no
I'm not religious, I simply believe in humanity.

I suspect we have exhausted the KaTe content of this discussion, so
if you want to continue the debate please reply by e-mail.
