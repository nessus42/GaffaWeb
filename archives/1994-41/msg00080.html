It appears that Sony Canada has come through with TLTCTC, because copies
of it are available here (Prince Edward Island) which means they must be
available everywhere else in this great country :)

I watched it last night in two parts (interrupted by dinner guests).
I really enjoyed it! There were some small things I would quibble with,
.e.g. parts like Eat the Music which weren't really explained in terms of
how they fit into a plot which which was sort of vague :) and what the
heck Lindsey Kemp was supposed to be, but on the whole it was a
gorgeous-looking film and very accomplished and confident.

A previous poster mentioned that Kate wasn't the world's greatest actress.
I would agree but would also point out that she is acting against a very
competent actress (Miranda Richardson), and perhaps many of us would look
less skilled in that situation....

Also, I'm glad I saw The Red Shoes (Michael Powell's movie) because I
think it really informs a lot of what is going on in TLTCTC, particularly
the atmosphere of the Red Shoes ballet at the end of the Powell film. I
suspect Kate was striving for a similar dreamy/fevered feeling.

Oh well, my summary is: two thumbs up.

Cheers, Fiona
