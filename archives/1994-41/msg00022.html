I still can't spell:-)  Well, hopefully my spaceyness brightened the day 
for people:-)  It's got to be more entertaining than all the bickering!

I'm somewhat new to this list, so I don't want to get into fights/flame 
wars right off, but I feel that I should state my opinions.  I think the 
whole situation could be solved very simply.  Someone on the pro-Tarot 
side who wants to take the responsibility for doing it &amp; organizing it, 
post a message to that sort, then everyone who wants to help, E-Mail 
them.  (The only problem then is if more than one person wants to be in 
charge, but then all the interested parties can work it out between them 
&amp; then post who is in charge.)  Then, if/when the deck is ever finished, 
post how to get it for those who are interested.  Those who are 
interested, buy it.  Those who aren't, ignore it.  I, for one, would be 
interested in buying a deck but not in making it.  I just don't have time 
for it, sorry.  The people who are for an ordinary deck of cards, make a 
set of them.  Personally, I'd be interested in both.  

As for all the bickering about different spiritual beliefs, I think it 
would be better if people just adopted the policy of "Live and let 
live."  In other words, don't shove your beliefs down people's throats 
(whether Christian, Wiccan, agnostic, athiest,etc.), but don't think that 
you have to completely avoid the subject.  I, for one, find it 
interesting when people share beliefs that are different from mine and 
then explain why they hold them--it is enlightening about the person and it 
helps me to examine why I hold my own beliefs (often strengthening my arguments 
for my own beliefs in the process.)  In other words, it can be a learning 
experience for all involved.

As for Kate's beliefs, it is irrelevant if hers are the same as mine--I'm 
a fan of her music regardless.  The beliefs of the artist are not always 
the same as the beliefs of her fans.  I myself quite enjoy a lot of art 
created under the auspices of the Catholic church (Gregorian chants, 
Hildegard von Bingen, Bach, Vivaldi, the many beautiful cathedrals of 
Europe, etc.), and my family's not even Christian.  It's Jewish, 
although I consider myself to be a Panthiest and a Pagan.  But, even 
though my family is Jewish, we still went to Notre Dame when we were in 
Paris.

On the other hand, knowing something about an artist's belief system does 
help in the appreciation and understanding of her art.  So a discussion 
of Kate's beliefs (as she's made them be known via her statements and 
songs) is appropriate, not in order to convert all her fans to the same 
beliefs, but in order to better understand her art.  It seems to me that 
Kate has had some involvement with magic, the occult, or some sort of 
esotericism/mysticism since the beginning (look at the words to "Them Heavy 
People" or "Strange Phenomena" for example).  Now whether or not she is involved 
with this on a more than merely literary/symbolic/metaphoric level, I 
don't know.  (Just think how many artists throughout the centuries have 
used Greek and Roman myths for inspiration w/o believing in Greek or 
Roman religion.)  But knowing about the ideas that gave her inspiration, 
whether spiritual or merely metaphorical, helps one to understand the music 
more.  

I used to be a Christian basher until about half a year ago when I 
realized that I was denying Christians the very right that I was 
expecting them to give me:  the right to believe in what I believe in 
without expecting everyone else to agree with me.  Now I realize that my 
criticisms should be directed towards institutions and acts that repress 
others from excercizing this same right.  I even have respect for some 
Christian teachings, especially "Love thy neighbor" and "Love thine 
enemy."  Any belief that helps an individual to become nicer to others 
and to make it through the day is a good belief for that particular 
INDIVIDAL in my book.  Just don't expect me believe it too.

Please don't flame me on this--I'm trying to settle arguments, not start
them.

Renee
