&gt;Why oh why oh why did she have to sign with the sleaziest quantity-
&gt;before-quality record company in America???????  Did they offer her
&gt;*that* good a deal?  (Those of you who think that signing with CBS
&gt;will necessarily mean better promotion of her music, remember how
&gt;much good that did Wendy Carlos.  She finally ended up signing with
&gt;Larry Fast's Audion label.)

I agree!  I happen to be listening to a tape of HoL as I type (I
don't have a turntable at work).  I only played it once to tape it
and it already sounds like it has years of wear on it.  I still
haven't switched to CD media yet because most of the artists I
listen to are on labels like Private Music which have near-Japanese
quality pressings.  I'm waiting for DAT to settle down, so I don't
have to waste any money on over-priced Read Only CD's.  Is it true
that there is legislation to prevent the sale of imported records?
Like the Japanese pressings I understand are on virgin vinyl?
It seems like job one of the record companies is to preserve their
profits, and the actual quality of albums (and many of the CDs I
have listened to as well) is like job null.  They had rather
reduce the quality of all CDs legally purchased, than allow a
consumer to make a high quality (I hardly think an ANALOG copy of
a CD onto DAT is HIGH quality) copy of their poor merchandise.
I guess the want to prevent competition from overseas as well.

&gt;
&gt;The interested reader is directed to a discussion over in rec.food.veg
&gt;regarding what vegetarians feed their pets.  The general consensus is
&gt;that it's ok to feed a dog a vegetarian diet, but not a cat.  The
&gt;cat family is carnivorous; all cats *must* have meat in their diets.
&gt;
Cats will go blind due to the lack of a certain hormone if they do not
get meat (I forget the name)
