Subject: The Legendary Peter Swales Interview

Michael Mendelson asks where he can get the legendary Peter Swales
interview.  I don't know why all of the episodes are not in the
Love-Hounds Archives, however, there is good news.  The interview is
available via anonymous FTP from gaffa.mit.edu in the files
/love-hounds/kb/kate-says/swales-85.[1-5] .  Enjoy!

Subject: Kashka

A long time ago I too wondered whether or not "Kashka from Baghdad" is
about two male lovers or a more traditional affair.  I thought that
the name "Kashka" is a female name, so my predilection was in favor of
a heterosexual affair.  I don't know why I thought the name Kashka is
a female name -- it just sounded female to me.  In any case, I went to
the library and searched high and low for any reference to the name
Kashka in any book and could not find a single one.  Later, I asked
John Carder Bush in person whether Kashka is male or female, and he
said that Kashka is male.  There you have it.  From the horse's
brother's mouth itself.

Subject: "The Dreaming" and "Hammerheads"

Well, I wish people wouldn't make definitive statements (Jon!) without
knowing the Whole Story.  "The Dreaming" rips off its beat from the
song "Sun Arise" by Rolf Harris, who is the author of "Tie Me Kangaroo
Down", by the way.  Rolf Harris even appears on the song "The
Dreaming" playing the digerido.  Rolf Harris, in turn, stole the
rhythm from the Aborigines, who use this rhythm quite extensively.
Kate was quite aware of the origins of the rhythm when she borrowed it
from Rolf Harris.

Who does Danielle Dax borrow the rhythm from?  Well, I don't know for
sure.  I would think she has almost definitely heard "The Dreaming".
However, I would be very surprized if she hasn't also heard "Sun
Arise" and know of the Aboriginal nature of the beat's origin.
Danielle has speed up the beat way out of proportion to its originally
intended tempo, however.

I haven't been able to find a record containing Rolf Harris performing
"Sun Arise" but I do own an Alice Cooper record where he covers "Sun
Arise".  (I also have a very poor recording of Rolf Harris's original
version from the radio -- the beat is exactly the same as on "The
Dreaming".)

Subject: Kick Kovers

Mark Anderson writes that he wants to get *The Kick Inside* but
doesn't want the "Tammy Wynette" cover.  I find it strange that Mark
is worried about this since he is from Canada.  The Canadian cover of
*The Kick Inside* is not the "Tammy Wynette" cover, which is the U.S.
cover, but rather the "Vogue" or "Oh my aching hairdo" cover.  Have
they changed the cover in Canada recently to match the U.S. cover?  Or
perhaps they don't manufacture any *Kick Inside* CD's in Canada?  In
any case, indeed it is better to get the real cover, which is the
"Kite" cover.

In the U.S., British import CD's often go for as much as $20.  $25
seems a bit high.  You might see if some other store can special order
it for you for cheaper, but it's probably not worth the trouble.

Subject: Weird Test Pressings of "The Dreaming"

I have never heard of these colored test pressings before, so they
must be pretty rare if they are legit.  Nor have I ever seen or heard
of *The Dreaming* on colored vinyl, at all.

&gt; From: brianw@microsoft.UUCP (Brian Willoughby)

&gt; I'm waiting for DAT to settle down, so I don't have to waste any
&gt; money on over-priced Read Only CD's.

Why do you think that waiting for DAT's will help you any?  First of
all, erasable, recordable CD's will probably be here before DAT's get
cheap.  Secondly, it's going to take a long time, if it ever happens
at all, for pre-recorded DAT's to be ramped up as a typical form for
music purchase.  CD players can now be gotten for as low as $50!  And
you can purchase CD players that will output the digital information
and let you record it on a DAT recorder.  If you wait long enough to
buy CD's, the government may muck their fingers in things and madate
that CD players look for a certain code on the CD, and if it exists,
not output the digital information.  Of course, CD's already
manufactured do not have this code on the them.  Then again, CD's will
almost certainly come down in price someday...  Then yet again, maybe
not.

&gt; So Ruth [Archer] listening to RUTH.  Is that significant, or IS that
&gt; significant. 

Not to mention that the cover of the RUTH single has Kate decked out
in archery regalia!  Pretty keen!

&gt; [Duncan Smith:] [...] Some of the genre are now regarded as
&gt; classics, e.g. 'Night of the Daemons.'

&gt; The voiceover at the start of HoL is actually a line from one of
&gt; these films (Maybe the one I mentioned.)

Indeed it is, Duncan!

&gt; it's okay to like madonna, jon.  really.

No, it isn't!!!
