A couple of days ago, Horace "The Eye" said:

&gt;Hey, Greg...It's fun, isn't it, first getting into Kate?  I remember 
&gt;thinking "this is complex, layered, convoluted music, kinda like Rush".  

&gt;Funny, though...the KateFan/RushFan crossover seems to be kinda thin.  
&gt;So, I enjoy hearing someone else have a similare reaction to Her 
&gt;KateNess.  My ex-girlfriend, who got me into Kate, couldn't stand 
Geddy's 
&gt;voice -- she was a Voice major, and she kept on complaining about poor 
&gt;vocal production, and flinching and covering her throat whenever the old 

&gt;boy started to sing.  I never saw her complain about what Kate does in 
&gt;"Houdini", though...hmm.

Just wanted to mention that I am also a major Rush fan.  Rush fans who
appreciate the 'prog' side of their work as opposed to the 'metal' side
seem to take to KT right away.  I got my bass player buddy who's a huge
Rush fan into KT by loaning him HoL.  My little brother (who is probably
the world's #1 Geddy fan) became a KT fan when I brought home all my KT
disks on vacation one year and made him listen to them.

Tell your girlfriend to lay off Ged - he is the man!  Have you played her 
any
more recent Rush?  Ged's vocals are a lot less mechanical and better
produced these days.  On Counterparts he even sounds like he's
enjoying himself.  He'll never be Micheal Bolton or Luther Vandross, but
if he was I wouldn't like him.

"Ooooooooooooooyeah!"   -  Geddy Lee, "Bytor and the Snow Dog"

Still awaiting the KT and Rush collaboration........
