I know this is probably VERY late but I'm ALMOST up to date with my digest
mail. Anyway...

Karen sez...
&gt;
Did anyone else pick up on EMI's announcement last week that they are 
starting a full-scale program to put their top artists with multimedia 
developers to create CD-Rom's for the next generation of albums?

They specifically mentioned that this program is an outgrowth of their 
"highly successful Video CD program which released work by such artists 
as David Bowie, Kate Bush . . . "

If anyone would like a copy of this article, please e-mail me.  If I get 
more than 5 or 6 requests I'll just post it  to the group.

So what's the scoop on this "highly successful Video CD"?  Does anyone 
have it?  Has anyone seen one?  Is this the elusive and impossible to 
find CD-ROM of Kate's Whole Story compilation that no-one has been able 
to get their hands on?

I need it I want it I must have it.
&lt;

This is that infamous VideoCD I got my hands on AGES ago and *still* haven't
been able to play. When I got it it said it was in "VideoCD" format and that
it could be played on Amiga CD32, CDi, 3DO and PC's and Mac's with MPEG
ability. Well chaps I STILL haven't got it to work. I've tried HEAPS of MPEG
players for PC and Mac, I've borrowed CD32 units and even written to PMI
about it and asked what I need to do to get to use this thing. I've heard
that I may be able to get it to work on my Mac if I buy a $1000 "Manson Video
Card" but some-how paying that kind of money to watch one video ... EVEN A
KATE ONE ... is just too much.

Anybody else got this thing? Anybody else able to use it? Any help at
all!!!??
