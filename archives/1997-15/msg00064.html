Hi!

I would strongly recommend against catching up on over a month's worth of
of love-hounds digests at one sitting.  It generally does terrible things
to one's mood.

I do want to throw my hat into the ring on a few of the polls, both
official and unofficial that have been happening here lately:

I am 25 (almost 26), and have been a rabid Katefan since the age of 16.
October of this year will make ten years -- I can hardly believe it.  I owe
it all to a boy on whom I'd had a huge crush since the fourth grade, who
told me about this weird British singer he was worshipping, and I figured
if she was good enough for him then she must be good enough for me. :)  It
turns out I was already familiar with Kate's work, but that's another story.

As of this week, my top 5 Katesongs are:

5.  Love and Anger
4.  Jig of Life
3.  The Sensual World
2.  The Saxophone Song
1.  Sat In Your Lap

The bottom 5 are:

5.  Constellation of the Heart
4.  Eat The Music
3.  Moments of Pleasure
2.  Why Should I Love You
1.  You're The One

(Hmmm, I sense a trend here...)

To be fair, I'll take _TRS_ out of the equation (since it was clearly
recorded by an impostor anyway), and redo the listing:

5.  Warm and Soothing
4.  Oh England My Lionheart
3.  Heads We're Dancing
2.  Candle in the Wind
1.  Lord of the Reedy River

And as for Katemas, I'm afraid that there's to be no Boonton Katemas this
year.  The weekend of the 26th we'll be in Chicago for a wedding (with no
time to attend any local festivities, alas), and the following weekend
we'll be out of town as well for a family obligation.  Bleagh.  So if
anyone in the NY metro area wants to step up and fill the void, please feel
free!!!  If all goes well, we'll meet again -- next year in New Haven.

A while ago, Leigh inquired:

&gt;     Is there anyone out there that went to the KB Convention back in 1991 
&gt;     (or was it '90 - my memory is not what it used to be), if so get in 
&gt;     touch - I still have the photos!!

Agh!  Blackmail!!!  ;)  It was November 16, 1991, if anyone is keeping
track -- and yes, I'm still out there!  (I was highly amused to note that I
appear to have been cropped out of the Love-Hounds photo that's been
resurrected on Rick's page, but that's okay -- the name listing has my name
spelled wrong anyway. :)

Rolf wondered:

&gt;Am I the only one who would prefer a no-frills Kate tour to a frills Kate
&gt;tour...or no tour at all?

Nope.  If Kate were to show up with just an electric piano, I'd be
perfectly happy to sit and listen.

Karen explained:

&gt;Yes, I have two possible explanations:
&gt;
&gt;1) Kate wrote the note early last year and the news update just got printed
&gt;now.
&gt;
&gt;2) Kate has been known to dissemble just the tiniest bit.  She could be
&gt;deliberately downplaying how far along she is. 

Either that, or the record really *is* almost recorded, and it's going to
sit on Kate's shelf for two and a half years before she gets around to
mixing it.  At that time she'll listen to the tracks and decide she was all
wrong and trash them, and the whole process will start over again.

Until the CD is unwrapped and spinning in my player, I'm not going to
believe it's going to happen.  And I firmly believe it's not going to
happen in this millenium.

Donna asked:

&gt;I LOVED the Rowan Atkinson duet! (Another Fav performer...!)  It was
&gt;everything I remembered AND MORE!!! does anyone happen to know what
&gt;the phrase is before "Is chairman mao dead?" something about some
&gt;sort of Head? I tried to query some of the lryic sites, to no avail.

"Is Reagan godhead, is Chairman Mao dead..."

Brilliant, brilliant stuff. :&gt;

Brian clarified:

&gt;Actually I am halfway through the Neveryon series and there are four
&gt;books, published, as Karen said, by the Wesleyan University Press through
&gt;the University Press of New England.

Whoa, I had no idea my alma mater's press was up to anything as cool as
that!  I'll have to seek the new editions out.
