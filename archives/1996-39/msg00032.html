&gt; I think that reading what all of you people write is so cool!  Someone asked
&gt; about Bjork, and I must say that she is one of my favorite artists.  In the
&gt; ROLLING STONE ENCYCLOPEDIA of ROCK, they write that Kate has influenced such
&gt; artists as Tori Amos, Bjork, Dolores O'Riordan of Cranberries, Sinead
O'Connor,
&gt; and Jane Siberry.  With the exception of Jane, who I haven't heard yet, I have
&gt; albums by all of these artists.  Sinead is one of my favs., so I'd like
to know
&gt; what you all think of her.  

I bought "The Lion and the Cobra" when it first came out, way back in
1986. I played it every day for over three months. Best damn debut album
of the last ten years. Unfortunately, I don't think she's reached those
heights again, although the second album came close and I admire her
desire to stretch her repertoire.

&gt;...I fall more in love with her every day.  I
&gt; am doing my best to introduce my friend Sarah to her.  I taped THE KICK INSIDE
&gt; for her and sent it to her via mail.  Last night she called and told me how
&gt; much she loved it, so I'll be trying some other stuff out on her.  Another
&gt; interesting thing is that I played several tracks from THE DREAMING for my
&gt; friend Becka, and she really liked them.  And TD is supposed to be the one
&gt; that is "inaccessable" to a lot of people, right?  

Well, yeah, to normal people. But that's not us.

Actually, I think the dreaming is the album where Kate most directly wears
her more avant-garde influences on her sleeve. She's always listed Frank
Zappa and Captain Beefheart as influences on her work and on "The
Dreaming," you can hear what she's talking about--erratic time changes,
screaming, blues-soaked lyrics,
songs that take 180-degree turns at any given moment, and of course,
donkey brays!

Boy, I'd love to see what Kate and Don Van Vliet (that's Captain
Beefheart, BTW) could do together.
