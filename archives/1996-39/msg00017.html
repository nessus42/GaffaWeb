Thanks Doug.  I also think it is great that someone like Knussen is honest
enough to say good things about Kate.  But alot of classical 'high-brows'
aren't, unfortunately.  Here is an example:
I am an avid fan of the composer Frederick Delius, and last March I went to
the annual Delius Festival in Florida.  The Florida branch is basically a
group of blue-hairs and nerds who would never know who Kate is, but I went
to the Festival because several members of the original Delius Society from
England were there to give talks, etc., and the England branch is generally
'on top of things'.  Anyhow, during one of the luncheons, I was sitting
with several of the English folks, and I brought up the Kate Bush song
"Delius" to them.  Well, of course they knew who she was, but they all
expressed extreme disdain for her and her music!  These numbskulls couldn't
even muster up any appreciation towards Kate for bringing the name of
Delius to countless young people!  (I became aware of Delius through Kate,
by the way.)  Oh well, at least Delius' amanuensis Eric Fenby has
acknowledged a certain degree of appreciation for the Kate song.  I guess
what I am trying to say, Doug, is that yes it is good to hear positive
comments regarding Kate from the classical crowd, which is so full of
uppity frustrated soul-less 'musicians' who wouldn't know genuinely good
music if they heard it.  (Sorry for the generalization, but I have spent
alot of time with so-called classical 'musicians' and, believe me, it
wasn't most enjoyable or uplifting time I have ever spent.  ;-)

Jeff
