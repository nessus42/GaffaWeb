   A lot of people might have missed this very interesting post,
as it was buried at the end of a quote of a whole digest.

   Careful with that reply, Eugene.

&gt;I thought I would like to add my little bit. I have been a Kate Fan
&gt;since the Eric Idle Saturday night live show. I just couldn't believe
&gt;her eyes on WOW, and Them Heavy people with the trench coat. I went out
&gt;the very next morning to the local record store and, to my surprise they
&gt;had both Never for Ever and The Kick inside, which I bought on sight.

   Same experience here, except that they only had _The Kick Inside_.

&gt;Over the years I just bought everything that she put out, which is most,
&gt;but not quite all of which has been readily available.
&gt;In the early 1980's there was a fan club 

   Actually, a one man fan club.

&gt;in this area, Manitoba Canada
&gt;headed up by a farmer from Hartney, Manitoba (a tiny town).I have long
&gt;forgotten his name, 

   Dale Sommerville.

&gt;but he put ads in the local Winnipeg newspaper at
&gt;his own expense, trying to promote her music locally. Eventually, we had
&gt;a two day Kate Bush convention here in Winnipeg( population about
&gt;700,000) in 1985 called BUSH CON. 

   ...plus 6,000,000 mosquitos.

&gt;My wife and I, along with quite a few
&gt;hundred others went, and it was great. They kept on running Videos,
&gt;music, gave away excellent posters, photo buttons etc, and there was a
&gt;great visibility of her music etc, etc. around town for a few weeks.

   Vickie and I were there. I was the one playing the videos, and
the convention was actually Vickie's idea (we knew Dale before
Breakthrough.) Did we meet?

&gt;She, unfortunately didn't come to the convention.

   She did, however send a tape with a little "thank you all for
coming" speech.

   Hopefully you can visit Gaffaweb at:
