&gt; THE WINDOW BRIGHT LIKE SKY
&gt; 
&gt; Look! and I saw through the window bright like sky
&gt; black lace reveries washed down by the autumn rains
&gt; the river's hair is green and flowing free across the hills and through
&gt; the valley
&gt; down to its mother sea where pastel wings skate like dragonflies above
&gt; the grey-green sunlit sea
&gt; where white horses run in splashing lace through the window bright like sky
&gt; 
&gt; Look! and I saw through the window bright like sky where Lilac lay her
&gt; head on the window pane
&gt; wrapped in her coloured counterpane, a window to many skies all within
&gt; the spaces of her room,
&gt; the place where all places exist
&gt; in her many-mirrored dreams
&gt; the chocolate steams
&gt; feathering the view
&gt; casting rainbows on her lashes,
&gt; a dusky night scented stock to brew invented memories
&gt; the crystal dew on Ophelia's flowers clasped in her fingers combing the
&gt; black lace stream,
&gt; the dark vein of the emerald hills
&gt; that washes down
&gt; to the clear salt sea,
&gt; astringent and fresh, that bleaches everything clean,
&gt; that strips all thought to bare white driftwood bones,
&gt; an empty shell
&gt; cast aside
&gt; waiting for the champagne waves to lift it up and fill it and
&gt; pull it back into themselves
&gt; ...to flow underneath the tides, dragged down into stillness and light you
&gt; could drink,
&gt; sweet from the surface of the silver sea
&gt; in the utter east
&gt; opening
&gt; like a window
&gt; bright like sky

&gt; 
&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; Stuart responded:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;  SO, who is Jane?  Thank you all a lot,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A lot of people on the list like Jane Siberry. No she doesn't have a song
&gt; &gt;or album called Little Earthquakes. I haven't heard her, but I read
&gt; &gt;through some of her lyrics at <A  HREF="http://archive.uwp.edu">http://archive.uwp.edu</A> and I thought they
&gt; &gt;were good. She comes very highly recommended and I've been meaning to
&gt; &gt;pick up one of her albums.
&gt; 
&gt; Gack, Stuart, I'm disappointed in you!!!  All these years of watching
&gt; various people gush about Jane, and you haven't even checked her out once???  :)
&gt; 
&gt; Jane Siberry is a Canadian singer, songwriter, storyteller, videomaker etc.
&gt; to whom the label "quirky" has been pasted for the past 15 years or so now.
&gt; Her voice could be an acquired taste, though to those already accustomed to
&gt; early Kate it's not too much of a stretch (not to imply that Jane sounds
&gt; like Kate, she really doesn't, but their vocal chords were probably made in
&gt; the same plant).  She achieved quite a bit of fame in Canada in the mid-80's
&gt; with her albums _The Speckless Sky_ and _No Borders Here_, and a particular
&gt; single called "Mimi On The Beach".  _The Walking_ is considered by many to
&gt; be her masterpiece, though I daresay her 1993 album _When I Was A Boy_ blows
&gt; all else out of the water.  In the past couple of years she's turned in a
&gt; jazzier direction -- last year's _Maria_ is very much a jazz album -- and in
&gt; her recent performances she's brought her musicians from _Maria_ along with
&gt; her to do really cool things with her older and newer material.  She hasn't
&gt; forgotten her roots, though -- she just put out an album called _Teenager_
&gt; (the first release on her own Sheeba label), that is made up of recent
&gt; recordings of the first songs she ever wrote, some of which are more than 20
&gt; years old.  Great stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; For tons more info, check out <A  HREF="http://www.sheeba.ca">http://www.sheeba.ca</A>.  Do pay special
&gt; attention to the lyrics -- Jane's got a true gift with words.  Some of my
&gt; all-time favorite lines of poetry are from "At The Beginning Of Time", from
&gt; _When I Was A Boy_:
&gt; 
&gt; "at the beginning of time
&gt; before there were waves
&gt; we'd sit in our boats
&gt; we'd float there all day
&gt; 
&gt; "and there weren't any waves
&gt; cuz there wasn't any wind
&gt; cuz there wasn't any sun
&gt; we were waiting for the world to begin
&gt; 
&gt; "we were waiting in the darkness
&gt; 
&gt; "each in our own boat
&gt; each in our own thoughts
&gt; sometimes you could hear people
&gt; talking amongst themselves but...
&gt; (someone had a boat with wheels and I said
&gt; you're a bit early but I know how you feel)
&gt; but mostly it was just silence
&gt; 
&gt; "and the silence only broken by
&gt; the absence of the clinking of the masts
&gt; and every now and then a bird would not fly by
&gt; and someone would look up and say
&gt; what wasn't that ?"
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps!

&gt; 
&gt; Hello:
&gt; 
&gt; When I first heard that Pat Benatar did Wuthering Heights I was sure I
&gt; wouldn't like it.  When I finally heard it, I found I really did.  There
&gt; are certain aspects of the original version that one has to forget about
&gt; temporarily while listening to Pat--like the waif-like quality of Kate's
&gt; voice and the wuthering gales that you (or at least I) can almost hear in
&gt; the background.  Otherwise, I think Pat's interpretation is quite
&gt; sensitive and passionate.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Jennifer

&gt; Subject: LIONHEART
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, thanks again to everyone for answering my questions in a kind
&gt; and informative manner, helping me learn a lot more about Kate in the process!
&gt; I would like to ask some questions about LIONHEART.  I can see that it is
&gt; one of Kate's least popular albums, because the wonderful person who posted
&gt; his or her list of Kate albums in order of preference put it second to last (by
&gt; the way, I loved your list and think everyone should do one, even though you
&gt; may have in the past);
&gt; plus, I have never read a review for it that was anywhere near good (in
&gt; the ROLLING STONE RECORD GUIDE, SPIN ALTERNATIVE GUIDE, and a few others.)
&gt; It was almost the last Kate album I bought this summer when I was purchasing
&gt; the seven major LPs.  Based on the reviews I had read, I was prepared for
&gt; a boring, lyrically weak hodgepodge.  However, I must say that I don't mind
&gt; it at all.  While I would by no means place it near the top of my Kate list,
&gt; I don't think it is as bad as people make it out to be.  "Hammer Horror" is
&gt; one of my favorite Kate tunes, and I also like listening to "Symphony In
&gt; Blue", "Wow", and "Don't Put Your Foot On The Heartbrake."  In fact, the only
&gt; one I'm not overly fond of is "In The Warm Room."  Furthermore, the cover
&gt; is awesome, although that obviously has nothing to do with the music.  I would
&gt; like to hear peoples' views on this album.  Thanks for the help with "Jig Of
&gt; Life" and Pat B.'s version of "Wuthering Heights."

&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; excuse my silly question, but which cover picture does the regular Canadian
&gt; CD of The Kick Inside have, the US "Kate in a crate" or the Canadian "Vogue"
&gt; picture?
&gt; 
&gt; Btw, there are not only Czechoslovakian green vinyl TKI LPs,
&gt; but also editions in pink and multicolor marbleized vinyl.
&gt; And there's a promo CD of the Common Ground album, a black digipack with
&gt; some dark green ornamental patterns. I held all these in my hands on a record
&gt; fair last sunday - until I saw the price tags. ahem.
&gt; 
&gt; bye,
&gt; Rolf
&gt; 
&gt; and Kate doesn't weigh the same as a duck, she weighs 16 stone,
&gt; as everybody knows...

&gt; &gt; Kemp, *long* before the album came out, where he stated
&gt; &gt; something about working with Kate on a new project. Which
&gt; &gt; would indicate that the film was a long time in development,
&gt; &gt; even if only in Kate's mind, and her making storyboards,
&gt; &gt; and discussing it with other people.
&gt; 
&gt; AFAIR, Kemp's involvment was originally in connection with a proposed tour,

&gt; &gt;I think it's great that she has garnered respect in the classical world as
&gt; &gt;&gt;well!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks Doug.  I also think it is great that someone like Knussen is honest
&gt; enough to say good things about Kate.  But alot of classical 'high-brows'
&gt; aren't, unfortunately.  Here is an example:
&gt; I am an avid fan of the composer Frederick Delius, and last March I went to
&gt; the annual Delius Festival in Florida.  The Florida branch is basically a
&gt; group of blue-hairs and nerds who would never know who Kate is, but I went
&gt; to the Festival because several members of the original Delius Society from
&gt; England were there to give talks, etc., and the England branch is generally
&gt; 'on top of things'.  Anyhow, during one of the luncheons, I was sitting
&gt; with several of the English folks, and I brought up the Kate Bush song
&gt; "Delius" to them.  Well, of course they knew who she was, but they all
&gt; expressed extreme disdain for her and her music!  These numbskulls couldn't
&gt; even muster up any appreciation towards Kate for bringing the name of
&gt; Delius to countless young people!  (I became aware of Delius through Kate,
&gt; by the way.)  Oh well, at least Delius' amanuensis Eric Fenby has
&gt; acknowledged a certain degree of appreciation for the Kate song.  I guess
&gt; what I am trying to say, Doug, is that yes it is good to hear positive
&gt; comments regarding Kate from the classical crowd, which is so full of
&gt; uppity frustrated soul-less 'musicians' who wouldn't know genuinely good
&gt; music if they heard it.  (Sorry for the generalization, but I have spent
&gt; alot of time with so-called classical 'musicians' and, believe me, it
&gt; wasn't most enjoyable or uplifting time I have ever spent.  ;-)

&gt; Subject: Hi! (and some responses)
&gt; 
&gt; Hi folks.  I am new to this list, but I have admired Kate's music since I
&gt; first saw her on Saturday Night Live in 1979 (I believe it was '79).  I
&gt; went out the next day and bought "The Kick Inside", and have gone from
&gt; there - I had to buy imports for the next few albums because she really was
&gt; so little known here in USA then.  I still think she is one of the most
&gt; influential, creative, unique musicians of our time.  I remember filling my
&gt; college dorm hall with Kate's music in 1979-81, and the other students
&gt; there used to ridicule it - but I knew it would be big one day (and as you
&gt; all know, "Hounds of Love" came out and she finally became known in the
&gt; USA).  Anyway, I've enjoyed the list so far, and look forward to 'talking'
&gt; with you folks.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are a few responses to previous postings:
&gt; &gt;&gt; 4. Is there a general feeling among all of you about Tori Amos?
&gt; 
&gt; Good question.  I don't know much about her or her music, but I remember
&gt; when I first heard her and thought that she was the most blatant rip of
&gt; Kate that I had ever heard.  I've since heard some other tunes, and can
&gt; begin to see Tori's own style more, but I wonder: Does Tori acknowledge
&gt; Kate's obvious influence?  Or does she ignore any comments about it?  Sorry
&gt; if this is old hat.  One thing, though - from the interviews I have read or
&gt; seen with her, she seems to be a bit of a flake personally - a little to
&gt; into psychobabble and 'deep thoughts' for my taste.  Perhaps it all just
&gt; stems from some of her unfortunate experiences, but still it gets hard to
&gt; take after a while.
&gt; Speaking of other female artists - how does Bjork rank with you folks?  I
&gt; think she is pretty good, rather unique and interesting.  (She's no Kate,
&gt; however!)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; 5. This question is lame, but is there a general favorite album of Kate's
&gt; &gt;&gt; among you? I'm curious as to what people like, even though it obviously
&gt; &gt;&gt; differs.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;Here's mine, listed as I've told many people that they oughta buy them:
&gt; &gt;1. Hounds of Love. It doesn't get better than this. A masterpiece.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that HOL is probably her best, from all viewpoints (i.e., her more
&gt; experimental side, her more 'pop' side, etc.).  At first I didn't like side
&gt; 1 because I was so into "The Dreaming" at the time, but I came to love it,
&gt; and who can argue with the FACT :-) that side 2 is a work of genius, eh?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;2. The Kick Inside. Almost as good as Hounds, but not quite. The album that
&gt; &gt;   stirs up the most Kate/Tori comparisons.
&gt; 
&gt; A great album, but for me its appeal is mostly nostalgic in that it was my
&gt; first Kate album.  When compared to HOL, Dreaming, or NFE, it doesn't hold
&gt; up.  It does contain moments of unparalleled beauty, though.  And yes, I
&gt; can see how this is the LP most compared with Tori.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;3. The Dreaming. Probably her best record, but very disturbing and not
&gt; &gt;something you can play when you're in a good mood. Suicide and hopelessnes
&gt; &gt;show up a lot here. There are moments here that are downright scary.
&gt; 
&gt; Haha!  I love this album!  To this day, there is no album I have ever heard
&gt; that compares to it.  Genuine originality throughout!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;4. Never For Ever. Her third album, better than the second (which I'll get
&gt; &gt;   to...)
&gt; 
&gt; The first (earliest chronologically, that is) of the Kate album
&gt; 'must-haves', in my opinion.  This is when she really started to find her
&gt; niche, I think.  There are a few weak moments (I don't like "Violin" -
&gt; wasn't that an earlier-written tune?), but overall a very enjoyable album.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;6. Lionheart. Can you say, "Sophomore Curse?" Kate doesn't like this
&gt; &gt;album, and neither do most people. Even in early fan magazines, this album
&gt; &gt;was &gt;always people's least favorite. But, that was before she recorded...
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I know that folks don't care much for this album, but you can't deny
&gt; the beauty of some of the songs on this one - I love "In Search of Peter
&gt; Pan", and "Lionheart" is really nice.  But yeah, this always did have that
&gt; 'leftovers' feel to it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;7. Sensual World. Time Magazine gave this album a two-word review: Press
&gt; &gt;&gt;Delete. (It's a reference to one of the songs on the album.) I couldn't
&gt; &gt;agree &gt;more, but you'll find that those people who discovered Kate with
&gt; &gt;this album
&gt; &gt;tend to place it higher.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't agree - I think this album is quite good, really.  Yes, a bit of a
&gt; let-down after the brilliance of the preceding two, but still a very
&gt; enjoyable album!
&gt; 
&gt; Well, there they are - my worthless opinions.  I don't have "Red Shoes" (I
&gt; am ashamed to say) because I took a leave of absence from Katophilia for
&gt; several years and heard that it was quite poppish.  But now that I have
&gt; found this list, perhaps I'd better run out and get it so that I am 'on top
&gt; of things', eh?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jeff

&gt; **********************************
I thought I would like to add my little bit. I have been a Kate Fan
since the Eric Idle Saturday night live show. I just couldn't believe
her eyes on WOW, and Them Heavy people with the trench coat. I went out
the very next morning to the local record store and, to my surprise they
had both Never for Ever and The Kick inside, which I bought on sight.
Over the years I just bought everything that she put out, which is most,
but not quite all of which has been readily available.
In the early 1980's there was a fan club in this area, Manitoba Canada
headed up by a farmer from Hartney, Manitoba (a tiny town).I have long
forgotten his name, but he put ads in the local Winnipeg newspaper at
his own expense, trying to promote her music locally. Eventually, we had
a two day Kate Bush convention here in Winnipeg( population about
700,000) in 1985 called BUSH CON. My wife and I, along with quite a few
hundred others went, and it was great. They kept on running Videos,
music, gave away excellent posters, photo buttons etc, and there was a
great visibility of her music etc, etc. around town for a few weeks.
She, unfortunately didn't come to the convention.
 To answer Rolf Puekert's Question, The Canadian record, The Kick
Inside, which I have owned since the morning after Saturday night live
has her holding her hair back, wearing two rings on her right hand on
the front cover. (Is that the vogue photo?) The back cover has a sunset
scene, predominantly blue and gold, with the lyrics, super imposed.
If she weighs 16 stone then ducks must weigh 16 stone, as they can both
float on water. Therefore,they must both be made out of wood.
One last note. The frequent references to Tori Amos confused me for some
time. I couldnt for the life of me figure out why one would compare Kate
to Tori, until I realized that I was confusing Tori Amos with Tori 
Spelling.  --Kindest regards to you all -Phillip Holbrook.
