Hello all ,
This is a re-post of something I sent a while back , in case anyone 
didn't get it while rec.music.gaffa was down ...... I've already got 
several interesting responses and would love to hear more .....


&gt;Read through the recent mail with some interest .
&gt;Here is something fresh for people  to discuss ...
&gt;favourite photos of Kate !
Yes, the music is the most important thing , but how many of us get a 
special thrill when we see some new shot of Kate , whether she's 
made-up to perfection in some ethereal set with birds nesting in her 
hair , or caught looking wrecked in a street snapshot !!!!! .... It 
never matters to me, I love seeing her.

If you had to nominate 3 images of her that would be plastered on the 
wall of your desert island hut what would they be ? Why ? Any special 
reason that this one particular photo has a special place in your 
heart ?It strikes me that being the wonderful , quiet , normal person 
that Kate is she would dislike photo sessions but of course owing to 
her brother John especially and others , we have a massive wealth of 
images of someone who's music has totally enriched our lives .

Here are mine :
1. The photo of Kate at the back of the TWW booklet . These three 
super-imposed images of Kate strongly evoke the three aspects of the earth goddess 
Danu .....I look at this photo and become inspired by it ! It is like 
a definition of the word "Woman" .

2. A photo of Kate appeared in a very early KBC newsletter which 
shows her quite drunk ( I like to think so !) , holding up a glass of 
champagne and cheering happily ..... this is the real Kate , no 
veneer , having a laugh , wonderfully human. (I'm not suggesting 
this is a regular occurence in her life !!)


3. The photo of Kate on the cover of The Sensual World single . It is 
in my humble opinion , the most beauiful picture of Kate ever !!! 
Perfect for her (IMHO!!!!) best song ever !

So , is this a boring irrelevant topic ? , I think It's something 
every Kate fan appreciates ..... when we were choosing our icons ,us 
Kate fans didn't do too badly did we ??!!!!

Take care ,

SEAN.

</PRE>
