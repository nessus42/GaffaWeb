Hi Lovepups, I've been away for some time so I apologise if this
article has already been sent in by someone else.

A friend just showed me it, from the Sunday Mirror a few weeks ago.
I was wondering if you lot are as angry as I was about it as they seem
to be making more out of Kate's eccentric, and brilliantly unique,
personality than they should::



Heathcliff! It's me, it's Cathy, I've gone potty.

It was the song that shot her to stardom in the seventies. But now
Kate Bush's obsession with Wuthering Heights has gone beyond a joke.
Shrill-voice Kate, 38, is living as a virtual recluse ..and she's
taken to calling herself Catherine Earnshaw, the tragic heroine in the
Emily Bronte novel.
The once-sexy singer - who has lost her slim, good looks - has long
admitted she is fascinated by the story of love-crossed Cathy and the
novel's romantic hero, Heathcliff, portrayed by Laurence Olivier in
the 1944 film Wuthering Heights.
And as her career faded, her Wuthering Heights obsession has grown. A
friend said last night; "Kate used to just use the name occasionally,
but it's coming out more and more now. She has even signed herself
Catherine Earnshaw on a voter's register."
Wuthering Heights was Kate's first single in 1978. It was Number One
in the charts for four weeks. In it, she uses her legendary
high-pitched voice to sing: "Heathcliff, it's me, it's Cathy, I've
come home."
The erotic image made her into one of the most drooled-over sex
symbols of the time. But the GP's daughter now lives her life behind
closed doors. Her 500,000 pound home, just a few miles from where she
was brought up in Bexleyheath, Kent, is shrouded by trees.
The huge wooden gates are guarded by security cameras and an intercom
system.
Neighbours say they rarely see or hear the woman once hailed as the
best British female singer ever.


&lt;END QUOTE&gt;

Remember, before anyone flames me, I am angry about this too. For a
start, if I remember rightly (correct me if I don't), it wasn't
actually the 1944 film that inspired her to write the song, and Kate
has always been a recluse. What happened to her house in Reading??
We all know Kate's hate for politics, so couldn't the voter's register
have been a joke to show her dislike for them?
What superstar wouldn't guard their house when they are as
internationally famous as Kate, especially when that house's location
is known by every one of her fans?? I  know I would take precautions.
Nobody says the Queen is mad because she has such high security!! :)

Anyways, I'll leave it at that, and once again, sorry if it's already
been sent in.
It's good to be back again :)
