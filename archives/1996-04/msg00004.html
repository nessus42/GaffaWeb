Hi Love-Hounds,

reading in Cloudbusting and The Garden about the recording sessions for
Never For Ever, I discovered that one of my fav... ummh, one of my other
favourite albums, Sky 2, was recorded at Abbey Road studios in early
1980 too (Kate in studio 2, Sky in studio 3). Classic-rock band Sky 
was founded by

	John Williams - guitar 
		[who later played on "The Morning Fog"]
	Herbie Flowers - bass, tuba 
		[is thanked on N4E for "making me feel happy"]
	Kevin Peek - guitar, percussion
	Tristan Fry - drums, percussion
	Francis Monkman - all kinds of keyboard instruments
		[played harpsichord on Lionheart]
	(Produced by SKY/Tony Clark/Haydn Bendall)

So I carefully re-read their notes on the Sky2 (vinyl) album (some of 
these, esp. the funny ones, are missing in the CD booklet) to spot any 
Kate reference.
The only could-be I found is by Herbie Flowers on an unusual track
named "Dance Of The Little Fairies":

	This one's got 5 beats in the bar, unlike a march with 2, a
	waltz with 3, or a tango, quickstep, foxtrot, which have 4.
	John plays an Ovation Classic guitar, as does Kevin.
	Mr. Monkman is on harpsichord, and the bass guitar and
	drums remain unchanged, as ever.
	The listener, once he/she can count right through the
	piece, is invited to dress up as a fairy/goblin/elf,
	choreograph his/her own dance routine, and when
	perfect, and only perfect will do, telephone Mr. G. Raffe
	on London (01) 722 3333 for an audition.
	H.F.

(Is it a reference to Kate, who likes giraffes and is often described as
a perfectionist, or is there a real Mr. Raffe with that phone number ?)

bye,
	Rolf
	
--
Working on the socialist maxim that for every two good
guitarists, a rock band needs at least one bad guitarist, I
have (not too reluctantly) picked up the old plastic axe for
this one. Tony Clark has thoughtfully placed it on the left 
side of the stereo, so that by careful adjustement of the
balance control on your hi-fi you can loose it altogether. 
Those of you with mono are stuck with it.
F.M. [on "FIFO"]
