Hi all.. I am Mark, aka the Sleepless Eye. I recently got involved in 
modemming and I was quite pleased to see all of you out there. I have been a 
Katefan for years, but I wasn't aware that there was such a tidy little 
underground.. expected more of a loose throng. As I am in San Jose, I would 
love to have direct contact with those who are doing Katemas.. I'm  coming 
in from the cold, as it were, and I will likely drag several people in with 
me.. I know of about 5 ardent fans offhand, having DJed locally for a 
college station. Infact, I will probably try contacting Happy's label to get 
a copy of her works out to our station, KSJS. It is getting lots of 
attention, having won the honors for best college station this year, and 
they are now reporting to Gavin, the major guide for radio execs out there. 
If Happy is half as good as is claimed, I'm sure she could make the playlist 
and, therefore, be mentionned nationally. I also saw the Kate bootleg in the 
CD wherehouse, but lacked the funds at that time... My aims should be clear, 
in that I would like to be more involved here and linked to the connections 
for Kate, bootlegs, zines, and Happy stuff.. (and maybe anything else 
relevant..)  It's you're move..
