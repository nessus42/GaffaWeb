&gt;&gt;Well, when I opened the envelope and saw the rather gruesome cover art
&gt;&gt;(a green-haired monster with bulging eyes and huge incisors) my
&gt;&gt;expectations dropped at once. "No wonder this isn't in stores" I thought.
&gt;&gt;"No one would really be inclined to buy this album, Happy unheard,
&gt;&gt;with this godawful cover art."

&gt;This is my favorite of the 5 covers; I think it's beautiful in a gruesome
&gt;sort of way.

To each their own. I haven't seen the other covers yet, 'cause I don't
have the other 4 albums. :-(. It's just a personal bias on my part; if
I'd seen that cover in a record store, I wouldn't have tried the
music. God only knows what Tipper Gore would do. :-)

&gt;&gt;and I don't really think that it conveys the "demons" that allegedly
&gt;&gt;lurk in Happy's music.

&gt;Allegedly?  ALLEGEDLY?  How can you say this, and then go on to talk in depth
&gt;about the chilling nature of "Case of Glass" or mentione "Wretches Gone Awry"?


Okay, so "allegedly" wasn't a good choice of words. They *are* dark forces
at work in Happy's music. . .she could probably get a gig at the
Roadhouse in Twin Peaks. :-) I simply think that despite the darkness,
there is more beauty than suffering in Happy's music. Perhaps that's
what makes it compelling--that light can still exist in sadness and suffering.


&gt;Take a listen to "Rainkeeper", the first track on Volume I.  "That I'm the
&gt;other half of the psychopath/I'm here, better fear me,/the other side/know
&gt;where you hide..."  Then try to talk about alleged demons.

Okay, Jeff, okay. . .your interpretation is Happily Correct.

&gt;Kate's music is deep as well, but she hasn't had to draw these Giger alien
&gt;figures to make that point.

&gt;There are very few songs by KaTe that deal with the same sorts of psychoses,
&gt;neuroses, and the general insanity and horror lurking in someone's mind.
&gt;"Get Out of My House" "Leave it Open," and "Mother Stands for Comfort" are
&gt;the only ones that spring to mind.  Most of Happy's music, ties into this
&gt;sort of thing, in one way or another.	Looking just at side 1 of Volume I,
&gt;the songs that deal with these internal demons, in one way or another, are:
&gt;"Rainkeeper," "Oh the Drears," "He's Alive," "Possessed," "I'll Let You Go,"
&gt;"Number One," and, to a lesser extent, "Case of Glass."

I agree. Happy's music does deal compellingly with the turmoil of the
mind. I still don't think of her music as filled with "horror", though.
Look at a song like "Moonbeam Friends" - I kept expecting Bambi's mother
to be cavorting outside Happy's window. Also, "I'm Not Awake, I'm Not
Asleep" seems a rather serene and peaceful song to me. Your mileage
may vary.

I simple think that neuroses can be artistically represented better than
with a leering demon - look at Edvard Munch's "The Scream". It's not
so heavy-handed.

&gt;I'd even go so far as to say that the cover art is justified solely by the
&gt;song "I'll Let You Go."  "For the pain will come and eat away at my soul."
&gt;The monster on the cover is the pain.

I don't think the cover art is justified, but that is just MHO. I think
your interpretation of "I'll Let You Go" is a good one. Yeah, the monster
on the cover does look like it might include souls on its brunch menu.

&gt;&gt;I ended up listening to _Rhodes Vol 1_ *five* times last night. I cannot
&gt;&gt;remember replaying an album so many times the first day I had it.

&gt;I know the feeling.  I didn't think to make dubs of the tapes when I first
&gt;got them, and now it's too late--I'll have to order another set fairly soon.
&gt;Oops.	Scary thing is that, having had the tapes for close to 5 months, it's
&gt;still not uncommon for me to put on Volume II or Rearmament, and listen
&gt;3 or 4 times in a row.  They never seem to get old...just more powerful.

Absolutely. I won't say how many times I played the tape this weekend,
suffice to say it was a veritable "Happyfest" at the Abbott household.

&gt;Jeff--I've e-mailed you a copy of the Volume I lyrics as far as we know
&gt;them.	Enjoy.

Thanks again, and I have enjoyed them. I appreciate Happy's music more
now that some of the harder-to-follow passages have been deciphered.

Still encouraging those of you who haven't given Happy a chance. . .
please do. Listen to Vickie, Jeff Burka, Kristin Hargie, anyone
else who's posted about Happy. She is really a great talent, and
if you don't give a try, you'll never know. It's worth the investment.
Just start with one tape, or the CD. Decide for yourself. But please,
give her and her music a chance. I don't think you'll regret it.

Jeff
