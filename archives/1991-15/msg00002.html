Dear Folks, 
        Well I have just about added all the interviews I have into
Cloudbusting, which means I "just" have the editing to do, which I expect will
be about two weeks.  However, I am also somewhat shorter of interviews than I
expected, as one of the Garden interview files has apparently gone missing.  I
have only a few interviews left to put in, but unfortunately these are in
printed/television form, not transcribed, so this is a request for anybody who
has transcribed interviews already on disk, or who may be willing to type some
in.  If you can send some to me, please post a public message listing the ones
you have sent so if there are many generous fans they all won't have to send
duplicates to me.  I am getting close to the point of having to start typing
things in (which will slow things down considerablely, at the speed I
transcribe) so please let me know ASAP.  

        The missing Garden file contained interviews conducted around the time
of the first two albums and the tour.  This means the only interview that I
have transcribed from this period is the Self Portrait/ German interview
recenly posted.  I know that more early interviews exist in transcribed form
and some of them are in the archives, if anybody could send these to me I
would be most appeciative.  Also, this may or may not be transcribed, but If
anybody has or can type in the brief discussion with with Kate and Eric Fenby,
I would be most appeciative!!  I don't have this on tape, so it cannot be in
the cloudbusting unless someone can type it in for me. 
      From the "Never Forever period", if anybody has the "profiles in rock"
transcribed that would be great. 
        From the dreaming period, I have a great tape of Kate being
interviewed in a restraunt.  Unfortuanately the transcription I have only goes
up to the point of Kate talking about paddy, if anyody has a fuller
transcription, please send it to me.  The interview starts off with Kate
saying she has just got back from Europe and the missing section includes Kate
telling about how she changed her name from Cathy to Kate. 
        From the Hounds of Love period, does anybody have the "raw"
Nightflight interview transcribed? 
        From the Sensual World period, I need the FULL Roger Scott interview. 
Unfortunately the one I have is only around the area of the "Rocket's Tail". 
If the full interview has been transcribed, please let me know, as this one in
particular is very important!  
        I also need the already posted transcription of the "special" Q
magazine article from the boxed set period.  I had it but my hard disk got
wiped out! 

    If you have any rare interviews that you think I might not have at all,
please send me a list.  I have access to (but not neccisarily transcribed) the
Kate Bush - With Love book, all Still Breathings, and all Cariad
Kate/NeverForevers.  If you have rare interviews, and can even just send me a
photocopy for me to type in, that would be helpful.
Remember I am really only interested in, for this project, actual INTERVIEWS,
and then only when they contain at least one quote that is not just a re-hash
of other stuff. 

        Below is a *hopefully* complete list of interviews that I DO have in
transcribed form and have already added to Cloudbusting.  If you have anything
transcribed not listed here, please send it to me.
