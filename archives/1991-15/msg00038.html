The CD is Dutch Rock 1989.. alive and Well.. This CD is very hard to find, 
since it was intended for Radio and comes from Radio Nederland. There is a 
shineing star on this CD that shows great potential. It is Mathilde Santing. 
Her voice is dangerously good, and she has a strong jazz influence to her 
work, but it reminds me of a combination of Sting's jazz, Sinead, and Kate. 
I need more of her music, having only one track, but that track is 
infinitely promising. The CD comes with a thorough bio about her for those 
interested...

Mathilde Santing Ensemble
(edited for brevity..)
Amsterdam born.. started taking singing lessons at 13.. Plays piano and is 
best known for solo work with synthesizer. Warm, silky voice. First 10" mini 
album selftitled on Idiot Records won a gold disc in '85. Suported Randy 
Newman on European tour. Recorded second album "Water Under the Bridge" on 
Megadisc. Weird but stylishly arranged musical setting with upright bass, 
violin, harp, flute, vibes, marimba and sax. "Fragile, serene mood and 
intense radiant beauty." Two versions  to this album, one with 7 and one 
with 10 tracks. Took prize at '85 Knokke Song Festival in Belgium. Gained 
critical support in Britain in'86 when she appeared at Ronnie Scott's in 
London. Started work on "Out of this Dream" Megadisc in May '86. "finely cut 
gem, spreading an aura of luxuriance yet betraying minute attention to 
detail." 2 tracks backed by guitarist Bill Frisell. re-released last album 
as one-sided high quality outtakes of the original album. Recorded "Breast 
and Brow" in London, summer '88. Synth and conventional instruments...

more of her music. If anyone has more info on her, please e-mail me..
