I was flipping through the channels, and happened to catch Peter right 
when he was introduced by Sting.  I threw in a videotape just in case 
anyThinK special happened.  Peter did "GWF" by himself, with Sting on 
bass (and probably more rock acts in the band).  Then Sinhead was 
introduced, and sang a song.  It was a very nice performance.  I don't
know that name of the song, since I haven't followed O'Conner since she
allowed one of the great songs from her classic debut album to be 
massacred by a rap artist, but it was one I would be inclined to try to
find (was it on her last album?).  Then Peter and Sinhead did "Don't 
Give Up" again.  After the first verse, I managed to push aside my 
prejudice over anyone trying to do what Kate has done, and realized that 
Sinead did it her way, not trying to "sound" like Kate, and I found 
myself impressed by her effort.  It's too bad though that Kate wouldn't
make the short trip to Wembley to appear with Pete.  Maybe she's too
busy slithering around some gangly purple bod... OHSAYITAIN'TSO! 

Larry (l-h@cup.portal.com)       P&amp;K-I'm still waiting.
