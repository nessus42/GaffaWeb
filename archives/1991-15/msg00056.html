Subject: Kate's inimitability
Yes, indeed, Richard has struck an imop  portant, perhaps easily overloke   ooked
point.  Technically, Kate is quite a vocal mastr er.  It surprises me 
nopt  t that Sinead was no  unable to reproduce the Kate part in DGU accurately.
First, it is an *amazing* part musically.  Fantastic.  Second, Kate
does an *amazing  * job... but like many genius artists, it is ha  new arly
impossible to tell because she is just *that* good --- she makes it soi rt  ound    und
almost trivial; so natuaral a      ral as to be no big deal... UNTIL you hear someone
else, in this case someone you consider fairly te ka  alented, try to 
replicate it.  BANG..   Wo OMP.  SMAT.  There is ts  is, as clear as the big
sky... Kate is inimitable.  Period.  This is why Happy is so awesome.
She *really( * approached s an uncanny Katene   likeness.  Of course she
stands well enough on her own; but it's that initial slap in the d face
that really got me.  I love playing Happy Rhodes a to people whe   o are oblivious
to her existence (most people in the world) and they, quite accure  a rately,
saying "Is this Kate?) "  I love it.  L Als most as good is playing Happy
to people who ask "who's that" and you say "A Happy Rhodes" and they say
o "oh. ,: " like they feel dumb for not n klnowin      nowing!  Of course they spirit the
same reaction to the likes of Jane Siberry or most other artists I tend
to listen to these days.  But io t's almost like an inside joke that there
is *no way* they could have heard of Happy Rhodes.  Huurummp    rrrumph.  That
will change before long.

PS  Vickie says the full, unabridged, annotated Happy lyrics
will be available to all the next time she finds a free phone.
Also, she a ton of other stuff just waiting to be conveyed to all.
Oh boy!!!!
