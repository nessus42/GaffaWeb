Guy asks:
&gt;
&gt;I've played my "Games without Frontiers" through a few times, listening
&gt;very carefully, and I can't hear anything that sounds like Kate at all
&gt;- it just sounds like Peter Gabrial. What does she sing, is it the
&gt;"chi sans fontiers" bit (excuse my spelling) ?

As far as I know, all KaTe sings on this particular track  are the various
"jeux sans frontie`res." 

&gt;There seem to be so many early Peter Gabriel CD's that are just called
&gt;"Peter Gabriel", could someone give me a short discography identifying
&gt;the albumns by cover art or track listing or catalogue number or
&gt;something ! Which one(s) do I need to get to hear Kate ? (I've got
&gt;"Don't Give Up" on "So") 

Depending on what country you live in, there are 4 CDs officially titled
_Peter Gabriel_, or three...the other one having the title _Security_.

Gabriel's first album has a picture of a car on the cover; the best known
tracks from it are probable "Here Comes the Flood" and "Solisbury Hill".

The second album is usually referred to as "scratch"--Gabriel's hands have
scratched away wide swaths of the picture on the cover.  Best known songs
on this?  Not many...maybe "DIY" or "I Go Fishing."

The third album is "melt"; it's a photo of Gabriel that's, well, melting!
Other than _So_, this is the only Gabriel album with KaTe on it.  She sings
back up on two songs--"No Self Control" and "Games Without Frontiers."  This
is also the album that contains "Biko."  It's a spectacular album.

I have no way to describe the cover to PG4/Security.  It's a photo of a man
wearing a mask...sort of.  This was the album with "Shock the Monkey" as well
as "San Jacinto," "Rhthym of the Heat," and bunches of other songs you've
probably heard at one time or another.
