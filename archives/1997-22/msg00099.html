&gt;Len - Thanks for posting the summary of the Musician article.  That's a 
&gt;real eye opener, huh? 

Well, it gets some stats into the discussion.  One can't say how 
accurate they are, but they are probably in the ballpark.  It's a 
hard way to make a living and it takes a lot to *Make It*.  OTH, 
some folks write a few songs, slam a band together and get signed 
to label deals three months into their careers.  A lot has to do 
with luck and location.  For example, opening in New York City is a 
lot more conducive than Plano, Tex.  One needs to be where the industry 
is.  OTOOH, bliss only needs a dancer and a drummer.  We get what 
we are willing to work for.  Sometimes the best rewards are so
inexpensive.

&gt;On the indie vs. major thing: it depends on what you're trying to do, and 
&gt;how much control you're willing to relinquish, and how interested the 
&gt;labels are, as far as what's best for a given band or artist. 

Yep.  Interestingly, for the majority of cases, the majors and the 
indies agree on one point:  No Tour == No Career.  Kate is rather 
lucky to do what she did when she did.  Would she make it now?  
Maybe.  The talent shining out of those eyes is irrefutable.  But, 
it would be a long shot.  There is a lot more competition now even 
in the GoddessBiz (say, devadasis?).

BTW:  hats off to the ladies on the Lilith Fair Tour for refusing to 
play in the Texas auditorium that refused to let Planned ParentHood 
setup a booth.  Good!  Stand up for rights which are yours by God. 
Your body: Your decision.  Kick the butt of anyone that can't get 
that through their power mad noodles.

More fun topics....

It seems we have lots of musicians here.  Where are the dancers?  
I seldom see here or anywhere a good analysis of Kate's dancing 
style, background (sans Kemp) etc.  It looks to me as if someone 
has trained her in BharataNatyam (sp?).  Many of the hand gestures 
appear to be hasta mudras (sp? i apologize.  trying to remember 
how to spell these terms without notes is out of scope).  As I 
listen to the Sensual World, for example, there seems to be more 
of music from India there than elsewhere.  The intricate rhythms 
for example and the tonality of the melodies are oriental.  Yes, 
I know about the influence of the Trio.  The more I read about 
the disciplines, history, and practices of Indian classical 
dance, the more I am reminded of Kate particularly in the 
practices of abhinaya.

Hoping that her next album is happy.  Forgive me, but I tire of 
the darkness out there and yearn for polyphony and joy.

Even the Cowsills made one smile.
