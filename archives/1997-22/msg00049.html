This has got to be one of the most misunderstood tracks of KaTe's career!
Yes, it is sensual; and yes, she wants IT; but it's saying so much more...this 
song encapsulates the whole dilemma of the male/female thing. The fact 
that she has a lover only goes to underscore her essential loneliness," the 
song of everyone who walks the path of the solitary heart". Her soul cries 
out in longing for her lover, but he won't give himself entirely to her- he 
has his reasons, or excuses, or preoccupations, but she doesn't want any of 
that, she just wants his " sexuality" as a whole thing; not just sex, but his 
whole relation to her in the sense of a man in relation to a woman...the 
trade off, and this is the crucial thing, is that if he does open himself to her 
on all levels, she will be everything he could ever have dreamed, from 
mythological archetypes "isolde or marian" to the sweetnes of nature, "the 
lily of the valley", even to an elemental force- "I'll come in a hurricane 
for you".
Plus she likes to rock- wop bam boom
	The woman is focussed on love ...the man is focussed on his dreams, 
ambitions, or whatever...to each of them it is so obvious that their focus is 
the essential one. To me "The Song of Solomon" captures this dilemma from 
the woman's point of view so perfectly.
	Who said it's not a very sensual song??Come on, can't you taste the 
perfumes of the east wafting out of the speakers when you hear that 
opening humming??
