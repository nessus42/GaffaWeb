Hi!!
	Here I was, sulking down in New Zealand (yes..in the cold, under the ice,
and with woolly jerseys and gas heaters.....) because I thought i'd never
be able to pur-chase the HOL re-release. But......how wrong I was!!
	(I'll tell you this because I saw 'the Tea Party' mentioned on someone's
favourites list.) I ventured to the largest city in my country......(7
hours drive) for a concert of another favourite of mine. (Canadians, the
Tea Party) They were on a short visit.....on their way to bigger
things.......(Australia..mmm)...and performed one show only in Auckland. As
I work in a music store, the record co. rep managed to get me free passes -
after much begging. Yippee!!! He also promised that I'd get to meet the
band. Wow!!! Yeah.......we'll see!
	After arriving at the venue (after a lovely meal with wonderful
much-missed friends) I hunted for the rep-type-person, but the place where
he said he'd meet me was closed off. Okay, so I resigned myself to not
meeting them. That's okay - you can't really expect things like that to
happen.
	Then, the concert. Oh, the concert!! I've never heard anything this
powerful. I wanted to sit demurely at the side, and watch. But, i just
couldn't!! I was drawn in, and right up the front. I had my 'respect shoes'
on - they add 4 inches to my height, so in the mosh I did much better than
expected. Jeff Martin (lead writer/player/singer dude) even heard me adding
in left out harmonies on the slower songs. I could go on for
days..........and I'd better not. 
	So, to leaving. Didn't wanna go. Not at all. The music was thrumming
through me.............and then, a tap on the shoulder!!
It's the rep-type-person!!!  "Come on Cath - we're having a few
drinks...wanna party?"  Ohmigod!!! Ohmigod!!! So we did....for 2 hours....
so much fun, and entertaining conversation! And, (snarl) swooning women.
But, I put them in their place! When one stated (and the rest agreed
enthusiastically) "Wow Jeff - You're just like Jim Morrison the 2nd!!", I
took offence. "No he's not!! - this is Jeff Martin the 1st!!". My rebuke
won me hug and a kiss on the cheek from my male idol, memories forever -
and reminded me of all the arguements about KT/Tori .....that everyone is
themself first - and all influences are basically to be noted, and thanked.
	So, after recovering from the high of the show, and sleeping.....we
departed Auckland.....but not before popping into the largest music shop in
NZ. And what did I find there? HOL remastered!!!!! Just sitting
there!!!!!!!! and it was only $26!!! (supposedly 2nd hand - but not a mark
on it) Like fate rewarding me for something good, and after all my sulking
too!!
	I also found a Tori single I had not been able to get from
anywhere......nearly completes the collection! The "un-availibility" of
such things here in NZ is very frustrating. But, I'm happy for the next wee
while. Now, I have a 3 Tea Party albums - each one signed, and all singles
that were released here. And those faces, eyes and smiles forever etched on
my memory.

	Thanks for listening to my rant....

	Katya

p.s - any other Tea Party fans out there care to correspond?

	It just goes
