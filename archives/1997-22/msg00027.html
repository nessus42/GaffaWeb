Hello all!!

I can't believe it!!  I have been looking for a Kate Bush newsgroup for a
couple of years now, but being the fool that I can sometimes be, I never
found it because it didn't have her name in the title.  Anyway, I'm here
now and I am sooooooo thrilled to finally meet some other people who
understand the brilliance that is Kate.  

I became a fan around 1990-91 when I heard the song "Breathing" on the
Greenpeace benefit album.  Kate is such a good storyteller in her songs
and has the ability to pull me in so that I experience them as if I were
there.  After hearing that song I was hooked.  I bought the "Never
Forever" CD, loved it.  Then being so sure that I would love every song
that came out of her, I proceeded to buy the Japanese Box Set without
having heard anything besides "Never Forever."  I never regretted it,
because I ended up loving all of the music.  She is the one musician that
I can't get enough of.  However, if I had to pick a favorite CD, it would
*probably* be "The Dreaming."  However, "The Kick Inside" and the Ninth
Wave part of "HoL" run a very close second.

The thing I like most about her is that she tells her "stories" from
different points of view (i.e. a son, a father, a ghost, an unborn child,
et. al), and very few artists can pull this off convincingly.  Most
artists will sing about a child (for example), but Kate sings the song AS
the child, and does is so that you feel the emotions of that child.  Her
ability to do this has always amazed me.

Anyway, over the years I have tried to introduce my friends to Kate,
loaning them CDs or tapes of songs I think they will like.  I have yet to
recruit anyone ... I always get the same old "She's too weird, etc."  I do
not know one person in real life (in the flesh, face-to-face, whatever)
who listens to Kate, let alone really gets into it as I do.  That is why I
am so excited to FIND THIS NEWSGROUP!!!!  Finally actual people who
understand the brilliance.  I was beginning to think I was the only one
(in America at least).

Anyway, I did read the FAQ (I just hope I read all of them, my computer
and equipment are jurassic and I hope I found all there was to read).  But
I do have a few questions that you can either email me your input
directly, or leave for discussion on the newsgroup.  You don't have to
answer all the questions, if you have input on just one item, PLEASE email
me.  Sorry, but I am so starved for Kate conversation that it's been
building up for years!! :)

Being new here, I hope these aren't FAQ.

1) Is Del Palmer still Kate's S.O?

2) Is there an address where I can write to HER or as close to her and I
can get?  I don't usually write fan mail, but I would like to write her a
letter telling her how her music has inspired me.

3) I am not a fan of Prince's new music.  I like everything of his up to
Sign o'The Times.  However I did like his collaboration w/Kate on The Red
Shoes.  Kate has done another song with him, but the song was released on
his latest collection.  This is like a double CD and expensive to buy for
one song, and I KNOW I haven't liked what I've heard so far off of it.  My
question is, how is this new duet?  Is it worth buying the Prince CD for,
or will the song be released on a single or Kate's next work?

4) I recently bought the CD bootleg "Collaborations" ... aside from the
poor sound quality (esp of the live tracks), I'm enjoying it.  Also being
a Rowan Atkinson fan, I esp. enjoy "Do Bears."  And I LOVE the remake of
"The Kick Inside" ... can't remember the musicians name offhand.  What
does everyone think of this CD?  What other bootlegs would anyone
recommend?

5) When I first heard the song 'Under Ice" I really got chills (still do
everytime I listen to it).  To me, her words and music describe the
situation so well that I can feel myself in it.  Then I started listening
deeper ... and started getting strong images of cocaine.  There seem to be
other references to drugs in the Ninth Wave, but none to me are as strong
as in this song.  How intentional was this?

6) Does anyone have any books on Kate for sale?  I have one that I picked
up in London a couple of years ago ... a Visual Documentary or something
like that.  How credible is this book?

Okay, okay, I'll stop now.  I have so much more I want to talk about ...
as I said, it's been building up for years!  Love to hear from some fans
and I'll definitely be a regular on this newsgroup.

Peace,
Tracy
