  I certainly know why Vishal Markandy writes:
 
&gt;&gt;Folks, this Happy stuff is getting to be sickening. I am tired of wading
&gt;&gt;through endless streams of Happy posts to find the occassional Kate article.
&gt;&gt;While I have always appreciated reading about artists other than Kate on
&gt;&gt;Gaffa, and consider Gaffa an important source of information for expanding
&gt;&gt;my musical tastes, this barrage of Happy related material is a bit much.
 
(I agree 110%!)
 
Steve VanDevender replies to Vishal:
 
&gt;&gt;Let's face it, there are a lot more interesting things to say
&gt;&gt;about Happy Rhodes right now than there are to say about Kate.
&gt;&gt;There may be an impending Kate album, and an even impending tour
&gt;&gt;(SeKond Koming indeed!) but there is little more than the
&gt;&gt;rehashing of old arguments and occasional rumors of what is to
&gt;&gt;come.  So some of us are choosing to use this forum for its
&gt;&gt;long-agreed-upon secondary purpose of discussing other
&gt;&gt;alternative musicians.
 
More interesting things to say about Happy then KaTe???? Well then I
strongly suggest your in the wrong newsgroup! I DON'T care about Happy and
I'm getting *SICK* of having Happy info clutter my screen every time I
come up here to read and ask questions about KaTe! I have been a KaTe
fan since '78 and have never ran out of interesting things to talk
about concerning KaTe. I have seen LOTS of Kate related questions go
unanswere here in this newsgroup in the past few mounts and yet I have
seen no shortage of Happy info. Frankly right now you could not _give_
me a Happy record or CD!
 
Vishal go on to say:
 
&gt;Those of you who want to talk about Happy, please consider setting up a
&gt;mailing list or forming a separate news group. Spare the rest of us.
 
(Again I agree 110%!)
 
Steve replys:
 
&gt;_If_ it turns out that discussion of Happy Rhodes really starts
&gt;to overwhelm the group, _then_ it may be necessary to split off a
&gt;new mailing list.
 
Well Steve if it has not reach that point by now when will it??? Every
time I call rec.music.gaffa I'm bombarded with h.r. info! Do it now!
Pretty please???
 
Steve adds:
 
&gt;Frankly, I'd rather see discussion of Happy Rhodes (and not just
&gt;because I'm a fan) than IED and Drukman slugging it out over some
&gt;other bit of rehashed Kate trivia.  No disrepeKT to the goddess
&gt;that is Kate Bush, but I think even She would not want us to dote
&gt;so ceaselessly upon her and her music.
 
Frankly I think you may be in the wrong newsgroup! This _IS_ after all
rec.music.gaffa! _*NOT*_ rec.music.happy. If you don't call whats been
going on here concerning Happy "doting" I don't know what the hell you
can call it.
 
 Oh by the way every one is welcome for the *KaTe Bush* gifs there are more
to come. Thanks Richard for getting them up and available :-)
