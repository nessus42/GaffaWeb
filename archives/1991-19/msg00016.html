I just got a letter from Jeff Medkeff of Little Light.  I'll only
go over the parts that concern love-hounds as a whole.

First of all, I have been named the Sony rep for love-hounds.  Sorry,
all you people who wanted to put this to a vote, but it seems to
be an appointed position. :-)  My first priority is to assure the
Sony Product Manager that love-hounds is not the cantankerous body
he thinks we are from the earlier controversy!  You see, he found
out about us through Little Light, and what little he knows is not
entirely positive.  No matter what side of the controversy you are on,
it's important for Sony to realize that we are ALWAYS on Kate's side!

Apparently, Sony has problems even within its own organization.  You 
remember back in January when the Chicago rep burst into Vickie's office
and announced, "Guess what.  Kate's gonna tour!"  Well, Jeff says that
the Sony people HE talked to (which I think includes the PM) didn't
know anything about the Kate tour until he told him on April 6!

Jeff gets the strong impression that Sony knows NOTHING about Kate fandom
in this country.  So let's make them WANT to talk to us, folks!

Jeff says he will be meeting with the VP (of Sony, I guess) in late
June to talk about the new album, in a conference call with Kate!!!!!
If this comes off, you can be sure that I'll let you know what the
news is.
