7) Dreams Are

1) THE PERFECT IRONY


   I thought I wanted to die
   But I barely had the time
   And isn't it funny
   How I didn't even 
   Have the money
   To say goodbye?

        What the perfect irony

   And with this man
   I want to see the land
   But is my mind even?
   Oh I must choose to believe him
   Or say goodbye

         What the perfect irony

   And I want to love
   It's all I'm thinking of
   But isn't it sordid
   How my dreams can become distorted?
   Just tell me why

         My life's the perfect irony

   I can't decide
   If I should laugh or cry
   I think it's kind of funny
   How they say all I need
   Is the money
   To get by

   Goodbye

   Get by

          Oh what the perfect irony

2) FOR WE BELIEVE


   (Why are we worlds away?)

   What is this thing?
    What is this love?
  
     Where is this hope coming from?
      Where is this hope coming from?

     Why do we see future before our eyes?
      Why do we see future before our eyes?

   (Why are we worlds away?)

   Clouded with what's to be
    Make our own destiny
 
     We know that that's the key
      We know that that's the key

     For we believe 
      In what we do
     For we believe 
      In what we do
 
   (Why are we worlds away?)

   Safety scares us away 
    On the edge is where we play
 
     When we run others delay
      Oh when we run, others delay

     For we believe 
      In what we do
     For we believe 
      In what we do
     For we believe 
      In what we do
     For we believe

3) I AM A LEGEND 


         Yes they can say "She's not so great"
       That they could do the very same
     I am a legend in my
   A legend in my own mind

   Ooh I can feel all that I sing
     I can do almost anything
       I am a legend in my
         A legend in my own mind

     I have a brain that's taken me to the core of the world
     I've been to Anglo-land and lived beyond the castle wall

                  So pooh on you

         Ooh it's inside my active mind
       That I am one of a kind
     I am a legend in my
   A legend in my own mind
 
   I wish that you would all agree
     That I'm impeccably me
       Make me a legend in your
         A legend in all your minds
 
       I am a witch who lived before your time
         I am a prince and this forest is mine

                  So pooh on you

         Yes they can say "She's not so great"
       That they could do the very same
     I am a legend in my
   A legend in my own mind

   'Cause I can feel all that I sing
     I can do almost anything
       I am a legend in my
         A legend in my own mind

     I have a brain that's taken me to the core of the world
     I've been to Anglo-land and lived beyond the castle wall
    
                  So pooh on you

         Ooh it's inside my active mind
       That I am one of a kind
     I am a legend in my
   A legend in my own mind

   I am a legend in my
     A legend in my own mind

       I am a legend in my
         A legend in my own mind

         Make me a legend in your
           A legend in all your minds

4) 'TIL THE DAWN BREAKS


   I'll speak to you
   But don't you look into my eyes
   All my flesh will burn
   I'm here to warn you
 
     Children it's your turn

        Feel the night, live the night
        'Til the dawn breaks
        Feel the light, live the night
        'Til the dawn breaks
 
   I can't protect you
   Oh be wary of the lights
   For they mean you harm
   Stay with thy night loves
   Wallow in its charm
   Be you ready for the storm
   Gather your fern
   I'm here to warn you

     Children it's your turn
 
        Feel the light, live the night
        'Til the dawn breaks
        Feel the light, live the night
        'Til the dawn breaks

        Oh I feel the night, I feel the night
        'Til the dawn breaks
        Oooh feel the light, Ohh live the night
        'Til the dawn breaks

   Well I can't protect you
   So be ready for the storm
   Gather your fern
   I'm here to warn you
     
     Children it's your turn

   I'll speak to you
   But my flesh will burn

   Ooh, I'm here to warn you

     Children it's your turn
     Children it's your turn
     Children it's your turn
 
   I'm here to warn you
  
     Children it's your turn

5) THE ISSUE IS


   He lies with steel pieces in his arm
   He lives by steel, by steel

        He's gonna die
        And he's scared

   She lies with steel pieces in her arm
   She lives by steel, by steel

        She's gonna die
        And she's scared
        Oh where is she going to?
        And will she see mummy..mummy..mummy?
 
   They lie with steel pieces in their hearts
   They breathe by steel, by steel

        We're gonna die
        And we're scared

   The issue is:
   Does conscience survive?
   
        We're gonna die
        And we're scared

   The issue is:
   Does conscience survive?
 
        We're gonna die
        And we're scared

   The issue is:
   Does conscience survive?

6) FRIEND YOU'LL BE


   I'm influenced by my friend
   If there's a reason to cry
   Oh friend you'll be (friend you'll be)
   Forever close to me
  
   I've confided in you my friend
   Now we have something to do
   Oh friend you'll be (friend you'll be)
   Forever close to me
   Oh and when the time comes
   For them to see
   We'll still be...
 
        Oh living on faith of heart
          Keeping love and fear far apart
        We'll be running our own lives
          Making someone out there realize
        That we have a place
          We've escaped the human race

   There's a man at my side, a friend
   We have passion for pride
   Oh friend you'll be (friend you'll be)
   Forever close to me
   And when the time comes
   For them to see
   We'll still be...
 
        Oh living on faith of heart 
          Keeping love and fear far apart
        We'll be running our own lives
          Making someone out there realize
        That we have a place
          We've escaped the human race
        We've escaped the human race

1) BOX H.A.P.


   You can't know them like you know yourself
   
       I know   I know

   Therefore find your peace

       I can't   I can't

   Demand only from yourself

       I try   I try

   Don't rely on your logic

       I don't   I don't

     You made your choice
     Now go to the end
     You will find your peace
     When it comes, greet it
     Welcome it
     Make it stay

   You can't know them like you know yourself
 
       I know    I know 
 
   Therefore find your peace

       I can't   I can't

   Demand only from yourself

       I try     I try
 
   The instincts you feel are truth

       Are they?  Are they now?

     You made your choice
     Now go to the end
     You will find your peace
     And when it comes, greet it
     Welcome it
     Make it stay

   Can't know them like you know yourself

       I know   I know

   Therefore find your peace

       I can't   I can't

   Demand only from yourself

2) I HAVE A HEART

   
   I have a heart inside
    She's begging me for suicide
     She doesn't want anymore
      She's lived too many lives before
 
       So what do I say to put her at ease?
       I know she'd leave with the breeze
       All I can do is beg her to stay
  
   Oh she is deceived every day
    Cheated and lied to in every way
     Why do you love weak little thing?
      You never could handle the hurting

       So what do I say to put her at ease?
       I know she'd leave with the breeze
       All I can do is beg her to stay

   I have a heart inside
    She's begging me for suicide
     She doesn't want anymore
      She's lived too many lives before
 
       So what do I say to put her at ease?
       I know she'd leave with a breeze
       All I can do is beg her to stay

   She is deceived every day
    Cheated and lied to in every way
     Why do you love weak little thing? 
      It never could handle the hurting

       So what do I say to put her at ease?
       I know she'd leave with a breeze
       All I can do is beg her

                                                 O

   Crystal orbs, golden light
   Come back to me and to that night                      
   I stared at these for many hours   
   Until the waves came in showers
                                                                   O

      Addressing you only
      Now answer me
                                                      O     
   Go way away if you must
   Life and I will adjust
   Let it be that I know
   The fiery warmth and the glow                              
                                         
      I'm here and will be
      Addressing you only
      Now answer me    
                                                               O
   This warm and glorious night explains
   The soft peace of my remains
   Oh crystal orbs shining light                O
   Come back to me and to that night

      I'm here and will be
      Addressing you only
      Now answer me                                    O

4) BECAUSE I LEARN

    I learn                    I learn
     Many things                Many things
      The hard way               The easy way
 
            I know many things about you
               You never knew I knew

   I want to be                I want to be
    Wise enough                 Closer to
     To see ahead                Lying dead

            I don't need to live the same pain
                   Over and over again


          Because I learn
              once is enough
                  once is enough
                once is enough
              because I learn

                 once is enough
               oh once is quite enough
             oh once is enough
                once is quite 
                  once is quite enough

 
   I love                     I've made
    I love                     My heart
      Harder than               Painfully
        Most do                  Too true

            I take my lessons well
                 And so when
                They lie to me 
                 I can tell

6) RHODES WALTZ


   I am a fleeting thought
   Cherish and remember
   Tomorrow I'll be gone
   Understand that I am
   Momentary
   No forevers here
   I move on
  
      But if you ignore my presence
       I will never come again
      Take notice

   I remain for no one, no thing
   Be aware
   Tomorrow I'm gone
   But treat me with respect and care
   And when needed I'll be there
 
      But if you ignore my presence
       I will never come again
      Take notice
 
   I am a flying soul
   Don't clutch on

   Tomorrow I'll be gone
    Tomorrow I'll be gone
   Tomorrow I'll be gone

7) ALLY ALLY OXENFREE


        Aaah...oooh

   I can't find you
   You've hidden well
 
      Well, Ally ally oxenfree
            Ally ally oxenfree

   I can't find you
   And I'm too tired to play
   
        So, Ally ally oxenfree
            Ally ally oxenfree

   You were here, right here 
   I don't know where you are now
   If you won't show for me
   I won't search for you

   I can't find you
   Must I be "it" forever?
 
            Ally ally oxenfree
            Ally ally oxenfree

   Touch home-base
   For your sake, love
   'Cause I'm going home now

   Touch home-base
   For your sake, love

      'Cause I'm going home
      I'm going home

               Ally ally oxenfree
               Ally ally oxenfree
