&gt; All of us had come up with some very inventive words that were as wrong

And I thought I didn't get it all because it's not my native tongue.
Reading now that I'm not the only one is a great relief (the "hundred

Just try to imagine what I am singing to myself (only in my head of course).
When there is a word or phrase I don't understand I accept the sound as a
word. And because of my limited vocabulary it's very likely to be a word
which doesn't exist or has a completely different meaning. Reading the
lyrics later is a great source of amazement.

&gt; singing 'traveling suit'?" She had heard it that way too and had never

Well, don't trust lyric sheets! You really can't rely on them. How often
have you found differences between the words on the paper and the words in
your ears? Probably some lyrics are printed before the final recording is
done, or an earlier version goes to print. So maybe you are right? Maybe
KaTe was singing 'travelling suit' and the lyrics are wrong. Just keep
singing 'travelling'.

&gt; Kate!  Wouldn't it be a great omen if with the coming of Hurricane
&gt; Kate, also came the real Kate? Say with her "upcoming" "world" "tour"

Let's hope that our hopes for a tour aren't blown away by it.


___ a lot of folks (Hi all!) wrote ________________________________________

So I finally had to look it up in my dictionary.
... So that's what it means!
...... It's a _Brummbar_ (with 2 dots above the 'a')!  ;-)
