Greetings,
     A day or two ago, someone posted a minor complaint about Love-Hounds
recommending non-KaTe artists who were just KaTe Klones.  At first, I
let it pass, but a day later, I find it still sticks in my claw and demands
a response.  Unfortunately, I saved neither the post nor the author.  I
apologize for that, and any details I get wrong.
     I am certain that no one who reads this newsgroup is unaware that
KaTe is a unique talent.  If her talent is not unique, her expression of
it certain is.  I question whether anyone can successfully duplicate the
style of her music.  Even covering some of her songs may be impossible.
Anyone who has the ability to come close to copying KaTe's work and style
has enough talent to eventually find their own voice.  Even so, aiming at
the same target as KaTe certainly is not the wrong way to start a career.
Besides, at least in America, KaTe is definitely not a commercial success.
No one would try to imitate her style just to make bucks.  Heck, the world
could do with a batch of bands aping KaTe than the latest rap or heavy
metal group.
     The poster raised two individuals specifically, both of whom I enjoy
thoroughly.  Neither of them are KaTe Klones.
     On the surface, one can find similarities between Jane Siberry and
KaTe.  However, Jane is an artist who can stand fully on her own.  For
example, I discovered Jane quite independently of KaTe.  The name 'Jane
Siberry' kept popping up as a positive standard of comparison in record
reviews.  Finally, I read a review of _Suzanne Vega_, which rated Jane
above Suzanne.  I loved the album _Suzanne Vega_, so I just had to try Jane.
I bought a copy of _The Speckless Sky_ and was bowled over on the first
listen.  In my opinion [He dons his best flame-proof suit], I like this
album better than any single KaTe album, [though to placate the howling
Love-Hounds, I'd take KaTe's whole opus over Jane's].  Outside of the heavy
synthesizer dependence and a woman's voice, I find few similarities with
KaTe.  Jane's lyrics tend to be more personal, and the emotional depth and
complexity of the songs on _The Speckless Sky_ is incredible.  I've
listened to it six or seven times, and my opinions of what certain songs mean
have changed tremendously.  Comparatively, KaTe's lyrics show much less of
her soul or emotions.  Musically, Jane's voice hops, jumps, leaps, and dances
around the melody, while KaTe sings her lyrics more straightforwardly, albeit
in her own unique style.  As for the music itself, Jane's style varies much
more from album to album, but basically built around synthesizer, guitar, and
rhythm, without the international stamp that KaTe like to put in her music.
_The Speckless Sky_ has always strongly reminded me of XTC of _The Black Sea_
period.  Most of the songs confidently walk the line between music and chaos,
occasionally falling off, then break into an incredibly catchy hook-laden
chorus.  I dare you to listen to _The Speckless Sky_ and not have the chorus
of _Map of the World, Pt II_ rattling around your brain for the next day or
two!  I hope this convinces you that Jane is no mere KaTe wannabee.
     As for Happy Rhodes, since you haven't heard her yet, I'll excuse you
more :-).  Just one listen will convince you she is not a KaTe Klone.  Her
lyrics are emotionally raw, overturning the rocks in her soul to show the
maggots, worms, and mud underneath, light years away from KaTe's literary
allusions and playfulness.  Her musical accompaniment is very simple,
straightforward guitar or synthesizer.  Happy's voice is a treasure, gorgeous
at both ends of her range.  Yet I do suspect that KaTe has influenced
Happy.  The resemblance between Happy's and KaTe's voices at their higher
registers is uncanny.  The phrasing is so similar that I can't help but feel
Happy does it intentionally.  One song on Vol I (I forget which) struck me
very much as a homage to KaTe.  Yet even with this, Happy is her own very
unique voice.  I strongly, strongly recommend her music.
     KaTe Bush, Jane Siberry, Happy Rhodes, and other artists frequently
mentioned in this group (and I personally will add a few others more rarely
mentioned, such as Suzanne Vega, Laurie Anderson, and Joni Mitchell) work a
large fertile field of music which has barely been planted.  This field is
so large that lots of space separates the artists working on it, yet the
others are the only points of reference.  It's hard to talk about one artist
working this field without pointing to another.  Yet the difference between
KaTe and Jane alone probably would encompass the whole range of rap music
groups.  One very useful feature of LoveHounds is to point out other artists
who work this field.  So far, I have found none of them to be KaTe Klones.
Open up your own mind and try them!
