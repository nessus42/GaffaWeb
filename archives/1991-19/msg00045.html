In article &lt;numbers deleted&gt; Richard Caldwell quoth:

&gt; You should be aware that Juby's book has been widely panned for it's
&gt; slipshod journalism.  I'd have to check Juby's remarks on _The Ninth
&gt; Wave_ to point out any specific problems.  I seem to recall that Juby
&gt; did at least get the general idea correct but his details are
&gt; unreliable.  

The way I see the book is that the guy was too much of a KaTefan to write
a proper biography. I don't hold that against him - hey, am I not the guy
who would sell his liver to a catfood factory for a concert ticket? - but
it does mean that it gives his fellow-worshippers (e.g me) plenty of warm
fuzzies, while your average guy/gal in the street is turned off. For instance,
take the prologue, where the guy falls over himself to say what a nice
person She is.
&gt; 
&gt; The character in _The Ninth Wave_ is definitely a woman.  This is
&gt; most clearly evident in _Jig of Life_.  Also saying that _The Ninth
&gt; Wave_ is about "a guy falling off a boat" is sort of a gross
&gt; oversimplification.

It was supposed to be! (I knew I should have put ;-) after it)

&gt;			  More accurately, according to Kate...
&gt; 
&gt; | It's about someone who is in the water for the night - alone in
&gt; | the water.  And it's really about their past, present and future 
&gt; | coming to keep them awake to stop them drowning, to stop them 
&gt; | going to sleep until the morning comes. 

I just wish She'd made it a bit more explicit, that's all.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a tendency look for "hidden meanings" in great works of art 
&gt; and they are quite simply not always there.  _The Ninth Wave_ is a 
&gt; brilliant piece of story telling from the start.  Beyond that you 
&gt; have hundreds of little ideas and feelings and subtle nuances of 
&gt; these that you can peel away layer after layer.  None of these are 
&gt; really hidden but they may not be immediately obvious. 
&gt; 
&gt; _The Ninth Wave_ doesn't need any hidden meanings to make it a work 
&gt; of genius.  Being disappointed to find that there [probably] isn't 
&gt; one is missing the point.   Still, missing the point is perfectly
&gt; acceptable if you like.  When asked if it was important that people
&gt; recognize the concept nature of _The Ninth Wave_, Kate said...
&gt; 
&gt; | No, I don't think so.  I don't know if that's relevant or important 
&gt; | though.  I think the most important thing is that people that
&gt; | listen to it get something out of it, that they enjoy it.
&gt; 
&gt; You seem to have got the important part!

I'm not dissappointed to find out there isn't (probably) a hidden meaning.
What got me down was that I'd entirely overestimated the "Depth" of
the concept... that is, thinking it was the same kind of thing that I groove
to on Floyd and Genesis (who'd do enormous great spiels on Life, Death
and Birth Control). But that's just me being silly.
