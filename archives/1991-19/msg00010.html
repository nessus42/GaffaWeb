Vickie here.

       This was the first Happy album I heard, and it's still my favorite.

             Last, but never least...

1) I'M GOING BACK


       Where are 
       My monsters and cats?

       Where are  
       My attic antiques and bats?

   I'm going back 
       I'm going back  
           I'm going back

   I'm going back 
       I'm going back 
           I'm going back

       No life here 
       In the room 
       Where I sleep

       It's traveled ahead 
       To my stony keep

   I'm going back (to the rain on the trees)
       I'm going back (to my kitty on the window)
           I'm going back

   I'm going back (to the strings of the Guild)
       I'm going back (to my heart's desire)
           I'm going back

       Where are 
       My brothers, mother and dad?

       I had a family 
       And friends

   I'm going back (to the rain on the trees)
       I'm going back (to my kitty on the window)
           I'm going back

   I'm going back (to the strings of the Guild)
       I'm going back (to my heart's desire)
           I'm going back

   I'm going back (to the rain on the trees)
       I'm going back (to my kitty on the window)
           I'm going back

   I'm going back (to the strings of the Guild)
       I'm going back (to my very sweet love)
           I'm going back

2) IF LOVE IS A GAME, I WIN


   Oh baby, don't you know I can feel it in your hands?
       You've been awake for a million years
   Oh baby, don't you know I'll have nobody else?
       I'm in love with you, and it feels good

          Oh this is where life begins
            If love is a game, I win

                (Repeat twice)

          If this is where life begins
            If love is a game I win

3) WOULD THAT I COULD   |Excerpts of "Would That I Could" taken from    |
                        |A MIDSUMMER'S NIGHT'S DREAM-William Shakespeare|


            Over hill, over dale 
              Thorough bush, thorough brier
                Over park, over pale  
                  Thorough flood, thorough fire

      Would that I could    I'd be serving my Titania
      Would that I could    I'd never return
      Would that I could    I'd be loving my Oberon
      Would that I could    I'd stay for good

            I do wander everywhere
              Swifter than the moon's sphere
                And I serve the fairy queen
                  To dew her orbs upon the green

      Would that I could     I'd be serving my Titania
      Would that I could     I'd never return
      Would that I could     I'd be loving my Oberon
      Would that I could     I'd stay for good

            The cowslips tall, her pensioners be
              In their gold coats, spots you see
                Those be rubies, fairy favours
                  In those freckles live their savours

      Would that I could     I'd be serving my Titania
      Would that I could     I'd never return
      Would that I could     I'd be loving my Oberon
      Would that I could     I'd stay for good

            I must go seek some dewdrops here
              And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear
                Farewell thou lob of spirits, I'll be gone
                  Our queen and all her elves come here anon

      Would that I could     I'd be serving my Titania
      Would that I could     I'd never return
      Would that I could     I'd be loving my Oberon
      Would that I could     I'd stay for good

4) OFF FROM OUT FROM UNDER ME


   I knew a man who was very odd
   He'd always thought that someone was following him
   He'd talk of entities that didn't exist
   Or so I thought...

           Off from out from under me
           Off from out from under me
           Off from out from under me
           Off from out from under me

   His paranoia intrigued me so
   I was sure he'd escaped from the looney bin
   Every day it became clearer
   He was right...

           Off from out from under me
           Off from out from under me
           Off from out from under me
           Off from out from under me

      Goodbye my lunatic, I hope you're faring well
      I'm trying to keep them off from out from under you
      You were right little madman they're hovering at my head
      I'm trying to keep them off from out from under me

   This man had knowledge of right and wrong
   He could separate light from dark
   He showed me the horrors of infesting thoughts

                  Of emotions

           Off from out from under me
           Off from out from under me
           Off from out from under me
           Off from out from under me
           Off from out from under me
           Off from out from under me
   Out from under me    Off from out from under me
   Out from under me    Off from out from under me
   Out from under me    Off from out from under me
   Out from under me    Off from out from under me
   Out from under me    Off from out from under me

      Thanks be my lunatic, I know he's faring well
      It's over now, they're off from out from under him
      They can't hurt the madman
      Now they're hammering at my head
      I must die to get them off from out from under me
             
           Off from out from under me      
 Get 'em   off from out from under me       
 Get 'em   off from out from under me
 Get 'em   off from out from under me
 Get 'em   off from out from under me       
 Get 'em   off from out from under me
 Get 'em   off from out from under me
 Get 'em   off from out from under me       
 Get 'em   off from out from under me
 Get 'em   off from out from under me
 Get 'em   off from out from under me       
 Get 'em   off

5) PROJECT 499


   They say I've changed beyond compare
    I've ventured far beyond despair
   The atmosphere is different here
    It reeks of gloom and valid fear
   It's all set up, the way is clear
    All the bases been covered
   The time is near
    And it was all so easy, cried not a tear
   Won't be surprised to find my reaper near

             Oh baby please don't go
     I'm so tired and you're so right by my soul
   
   And as of now my fate looks grim
    The light is there but growing dim
   And if there's a reason for my mind
    It's been lost far behind
   So to and fro emotions go
    When life is done no tears will flow
   For days for me are seldom fun
    Residing I'm the only one

             Oh baby please don't go
     I'm so tired and you're so right by my soul

6) I WON'T BREAK DOWN


   You'll never win, I won't break down
   Because I have the strength of a million souls 
   Though you will try, I won't despair
   Because I've lived the life of a million lives
   Always known just where I was going

          To have peace with me
          And to have peace with you

            And I can see that day
            Yes I can see that day

   Do you know just where you're going?
   Do you have the strength to pursue your dreams?
   Through the years my eyes have cried
   But I don't run away from the things I fear
   There's no question that I am here

          To have peace with me
          And to have peace with you

            And I can see that day
            Yes I can see that day

   You'll never win, I won't break down
   Because I have the strength of a million souls 
   Though you will try, I won't despair
   Because I've lived the life of a million lives
   Always known just where I was going

7) IF SO


   I ask you
     Now tell the truth
   I ask you
     Was it worth the price you paid?
   If so...

   I know you loved me
     Darling
   But I need to know
     Did you mean to hurt me so?
   If so...

       Go away way very far away, take your leave
       I'll never hate you, I'll never think of you
       And I'll never grieve

   Did you want it all? 
     Free love
   Did it satisfy?
     Was it your intentions to deceive?
   If so...

   You made me happy
     You made me cry
   You gave me hope
     Was my happiness a lie?
   If so...

       Go away way very far away, take your leave
       I'll never hate you, I'll never think of you
       And I'll never grieve

            I'll never grieve the loss

   I ask you
     Now tell the truth
   I ask you
     Was it worth the price you paid?
   If so...

1) ECTO


   Should I die?
   Don't take time to wonder
   Is she near?
   Or are her brains asunder?
   This spirit must exist 
   And move on to better things
 
    Ecto
        Ecto
    Ecto
        Ecto

   Don't look for me
   Don't call my name
   I'll kiss you goodnight
   My soul will not evaporate
   My only desire 
   Will be to communicate 

    Ecto
        Ecto
    Ecto
        Ecto

    Ecto        I'll be here

    Ecto        I'll be here
        Ecto                I'll be ecto


   If you feel suddenly cool        Ecto
   While lying in bed                   Ecto
   Open your eyes                   Ecto 
   I'll be over your head               Ecto 
   Now don't be afraid              Ecto
   Don't reach out                      Ecto 
   Just be glad that I exist        Ecto

    Ecto
        Ecto

    Ecto        I'll be here

2) I CANNOT GO ON


   I cannot go on
    Living illusion like I do
   I can't go on

   I just can't go on 
    Thinking my dreams will come true
   I just can't go on

          I know it sounds crazy
          I know I'm sounding insane
          But I cannot live with or without
          My hopes and my dreams

   Guess I'll always try 
    To search for the perfect truth
   Guess I'll always try

   Till the day I die
    I'll look for the impossible
   Till the day I die

          I know it sounds crazy
          I know I'm sounding insane
          But I cannot live with or without
          My hopes and my dreams

   I cannot go on
    Killing my heart like I do
   I just can't go on

   I cannot go on
    Wanting the things I can't have
   I just can't go on

          I know it sounds crazy
          I know I'm sounding insane
          But I cannot live with or without
           My hopes and my dreams

          Live with or without 
           My hopes and my dreams

          Live with or without
           My hopes and my dreams

3) ODE


   Believe..the sun will come out again
            the sun will come out again

   Believe..your love will return again
            your love will return again

   Never cry for the rain
    (never cry, never cry for the rain)
   It brings us soothing sounds to sleep by

   And never cry because you feel unloved
    (never cry, never cry 'cause you're unloved)
   That's what your arms are for
   To wrap them around yourself

   And believe..the sun will come out again
                the sun will come out again

       Believe..your love will return again
                your love will return again

   Never cry because you're lonely 
    (never cry, never cry 'cause you're alone)
   Your love will always be around the bend

   And never cry because you think you can't make it
    (never cry, never cry 'cause you can't make it)
   You've made it this far
   That's better than most

   Believe..the sun will come out again
            the sun will come out again

   Believe..your love will return again
            your love will return again

   Never cry because you're scared
    (never cry, never cry because you're scared)
   The only thing that can harm you is your fear

   And don't ask why you must hurt so much
    (don't ask why, don't ask why you hurt so much)
   It's just a process of healing
   Remember..

   To believe..believe when I say..that I believe in you
               yes I believe in you

      Believe..believe when I say..that I'll love you always
               yes I'll love you always

4) DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT


   Ooh close your mouth
   Know I don't want to hear it
   No I don't want to hear it anymore

   You know I'm not your psychiatrist
   And although I care very much
   Know I don't want to hear it anymore

      Don't call me up to be your therapist
       Because you think I'm wise
        I'm a scary girl with a scary mind
         I'm a tired child
            (you won't find answers here)
           Think of me as a friend
            But I'll be of no use for you
             All my energy is exausted on me
               (there's no more room for you)

   You know I'm no doctor
   I'm only crowding words 
   Just to ease the pain

   Whatever you do
   Never never rely on me
   I'm not a happy kid
   I'm barely getting by

      Don't cry to me about your love affairs
       I can't help you there
        I've no patience for bleeding on my floor
         Take your wounds elswhere
            (you won't find answers here)
           I cannot read your mind
            I can't even read my own
             What little sanity I have left in me
              Is fading fast 
                 (there's no more time for you)

   Ooh I'm not listening
   To the hows and wherefores
   To the questions of your heart

   Ooh I'm the sole proprietor
   And I have to heal this head 
   Before I lose it to the weeds



   Ooh close your mouth
   Know I don't want to hear it
   No I don't want to hear it anymore
   You know I'm not your psychiatrist
   And although I care very much
   Know I don't want to hear it anymore

   And although I care very much
    Know I don't want to hear it anymore

   And although I care very much
    Know I don't want to hear it anymore

5) POETIC JUSTICE


   Get out of my world of worlds
   You little poets crying pain
   Just stand on your podium preaching beauty
   I've gotta leave you in the rain
   Now I've heard many people like you
   From the undergrounds of France
   Pushing your sickly sweet impressions of romance
    
       My ears have parasites
       My ears have parasites

   You think I've never heard the lines before
   With the candy sun and the creaking door
   Get your head out of the cotton clouds
   Put your precious feet on the floor
   Don't give me those power lines
   Just hit it right on
   You can be precise
   Miracles of mystery
   With vagueness your device

       My ears have parasites (go away)
       My ears have parasites (go away)
       My ears have parasites (go away)
       My ears have parasites (go away)

   Now clarify, what did you say?
   You know you're not making any sense
   Are you describing a vision of beauty? 
   Or a chain of events?
   Oh get to the point you sappy wimps
   I haven't got a lot of time
 
   Simplicity is beauty
   Are there poets less sublime?

       My ears have parasites (go away)
       My ears have parasites (go away)
       My ears have parasites (go away)
       My ears have parasites (go away)
       My ears have parasites (go away)
       My ears have parasites (go away)
       My ears have parasites 
       My ears have parasites
