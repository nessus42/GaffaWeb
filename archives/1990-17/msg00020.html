&gt;
&gt;   &gt;Well, I hardly expect them to go around bragging about it.  New Dweebs
&gt;   &gt;On The Block claim that they're doing music they love, coming from the
&gt;   &gt;heart, honest musicians, blah blah blah.  Bull cookies.

&gt;   So, let's see what we have here. You're saying that Kylie Minogue
&gt;is a hypocrite and a disgusting one at that. Your basis for saying this
&gt;seems to be that you hold this to be true.

So, let's review.  Kylie Minogue claims to be making music she loves
from a purely artistic motivation, whereas anyone with half a mind can
plainly see that she's lying.  Kate herself (he is quick to point out)
has lied on several occasions, although not about major issues about
whether she's doing it for the money or from some sense of being
inspired by the Muse.  Kylie can claim anything she want in print,
lots of people do daily, does this make it any more authoritative?

This whole thing has become ridiculous.  If you think Kylie is a true
artiste, working for a noble goal just because she says so then I
can't help you, and you probably don't want my help.  If you wish to
take this discussion any further, send me some e-mail, I'm sure
everyone else will be quite relieved.
 
&gt;  Certainly it's ludicrous - to those who for some reason are
&gt;strangely excited by Public Enemy. It's just as ludicrous to say that
&gt;Kylie Minogue's music is not wonderful.

If you're not going to take my word for it, even though as a published
music critic I am fully qualified, why not take other published music
critics words?  I have never seen a positive notice of a Kylie record,
whereas I have seen several dozen glowing reviews of P.E.

&gt;Your remarks,
&gt;however, are merely inane. To chant mindlessly about hypocritical
&gt;commercialism, practically frothing at the mouth, is to be sure the
&gt;perfect counterpoint to such gems as your remark - in, I suppose, your
&gt;more intellectual mode - about singers and lyrics.

That wasn't my remark, it was a lyrics from a Public Enemy song about
how radio ignores music with a message (like P.E.) and focuses instead
on "sex for profit" - an issue I noticed you skirted around deftly.

Please reply to me personally (e-mail) if you wish to continue this.
