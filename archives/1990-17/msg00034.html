&gt;    So, let's see what we have here. You're saying that Kylie Minogue
&gt; is a hypocrite and a disgusting one at that. Your basis for saying this
&gt; seems to be that you hold this to be true.

You're obviously a new reader--if you weren't, you'd know that this is
typical of Jon's posts.  He seems to have deluded himself into believing
that his opinions are facts; he practically said as much on a previous
occasion.  The best way to deal with him is just to sit back and laugh.
He posts less if people don't argue with him, and that keeps a lot of
noise out of the group.

Although I'm not a great fan, I do like Kylie's music, (and I am a great
deal older than 14 :-).  I certainly don't hold with the view that
anything that is popular must be rubbish.

Jim
