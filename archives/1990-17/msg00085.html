Vickie here. Well, this was my last live show. Exactly 100 shows ago I
went live (my first 17 shows were taped) and I was so scared that I 
almost quit. Now, I'm so used to being live that I'm going to miss it 
terribly. Even with all the mistakes, gaffes, inarticulateness, silliness
and weirdness of live radio, there's something about it that's more intimate
and warm, and I could get immediate feedback from listeners.
Things will never be the same.
This was a 6-hour marathon of requests and trying to cram as much music as
I could into my last few hours in the studio. We had a party and in one
room Chris showed videos while I was on the air in the other room. I'd always
wanted to have a "Suspended In Gaffa" Video Party, because I have hours upon
hours upon hours of videos by female artists, but it had never happened. We
thought this was better than nothing, so we showed what we could. Everything
from Kate Bush to Jane Siberry to Mary Coughlin to Diamanda Galas to The
Innocence Mission to Victoria Williams to Throwing Muses to Trio Bulgarka
and on &amp; on &amp; on. Most people wanted to see Kate &amp; Jane so Chris spent most
of his time cueing up their videos. I think most people were torn between
seeing the videos and being in the other room or the the studio with me 
listening to the show. I got lots of "farewell" phone calls (Larry H. where
were you?) and wouldn't you know it, I got 4 calls from people who'd just
tuned in, had never heard the show before, and were sorry they didn't find
out about the show before. One guy was especially heartbroken that he'd
missed out for over two years, because his taste and my taste in music were
dead-on alike. I tend to blame the local music papers and newspaper, because
I'd been in touch with all of them, trying to get publicity for my show, but
not one of them ever said one word about it in print. Hell, I don't get paid
for the show, it's a volunteer effort, so it wasn't as if I wanted to make
money from the publicity, I just wanted to spread the word about the music.
Anyway, I had a great night and I cried (I knew I would) when I did the
final sign-off. SIG will live on, but in a mutated form, so I couldn't help
but be sad.

Here's the entire 6 hours' playlist:

Yes, I spent the last hour &amp; 15 minutes on Happy. She's worth it.
(51 Academy Rd., Albany, NY 12208 to order her tapes. I would suggest
sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope for information.)
