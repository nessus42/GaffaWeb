   &gt;Really-From: Escape From Happy Birthday &lt;jsd@gaffa.MIT.EDU&gt;

   &gt;Well, I hardly expect them to go around bragging about it.  New Dweebs
   &gt;On The Block claim that they're doing music they love, coming from the
   &gt;heart, honest musicians, blah blah blah.  Bull cookies.  I respect
   &gt;bands who are crap and admit that they're doing it for the money.
   &gt;Sigue Sigue Sputnik spring to mind.  They took the piss out of it.
   &gt;Sanctimonious yabbos hypocritically claiming "art" while all the while
   &gt;keeping their eyes on the Bottom Line make me ill.

   So, let's see what we have here. You're saying that Kylie Minogue
is a hypocrite and a disgusting one at that. Your basis for saying this
seems to be that you hold this to be true.

   &gt;&gt;  Public Enemy are extremely boring.

   &gt;This remark is so ludicrous as to hardly warrant further comment.

  Certainly it's ludicrous - to those who for some reason are
strangely excited by Public Enemy. It's just as ludicrous to say that
Kylie Minogue's music is not wonderful. Or, to quote your
colorful formulation: "Maybe Stock, Aitken and Waterman are a cut
above Starr, but that's like saying that vomit is a cut above shit." Now
like everybody else, I take the view that what I consider good is
better than what I don't consider good. To take a recent example from
rec.music.beatles, I think the Beatles and New Kids on the Block are
by no means of equal musical interest or value, in spite of their both
having inspired teenage girls to similar frenzy. And it can be fun
trying to substantiate and clarify such convictions. Your remarks,
however, are merely inane. To chant mindlessly about hypocritical
commercialism, practically frothing at the mouth, is to be sure the
perfect counterpoint to such gems as your remark - in, I suppose, your
more intellectual mode - about singers and lyrics.
