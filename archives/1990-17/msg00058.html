 To: Love-Hounds
 From: Andrew Marvick (IED)
 Subject: seKreT message clarifiKation

 &gt;  when ied mentioned the secret message in both "deeper understanding"
 &gt;and "experiment iv" last year, i listened to both repeatedly for an
 &gt;evening and got *nowhere*. i hear both...but they are extremely hard
 &gt;to decipher. the one in du is just way too mixed in and the one in
 &gt;exp iv is, well, *messed* i suppose is a good word...
 &gt;   i'll try again tonight...and encourage all others to try as well!
 &gt; compared to these, the message in "watching you without me" was *easy*!
 &gt;
 &gt;-- woj

   There may be a "secret" message in _Deeper_Understanding_, woj,
if you count the touch-tone-like sounds, or the other interesting
details (the motorbike or lawnmower heard at the end, under the
birdsong, the whispered "Hello!"s toward the end of the
verse section of the song, etc.).
   In describing the "whispered vocal message" yesterday, however,
IED was referring to the "secret" message in _Heads_We're_Dancing_,
not in _Deeper_Understanding_.
   Just to set the record straight--because it really _would_ be a
waste of time if Love-Hounds went looking for a specific kind of sound
in the wrong song.
   One Wisner asks:

 &gt;&gt; compared to these, the message in "watching you without me" was *easy*!
 &gt;
 &gt;     er, what was it?, he asked stupidly..

   Not stupid at all. There were several. Several times in _WYWM_ Kate
mutters a few words in a low spoken voice which, when played backwards on
your turntable, turn out to be an actual sentence. Also, there is a Morse
code "SOS" message. Also, there is a section which sounds like "Really
see" repeated over in a high sung melody, which is actually another
backwards message: when played backwards that phrase becomes clearly
audible as "We see you here." Also, some high-frequency radio signals are
audible at different points, and these may actually be decipherable,
though IED has no idea how such a thing might be done.
   But the "official" secret message in _WYWM_ is the section where you
hear Kate singing a melody with "words" that sound a bit like" "Zwoh-
nikh-lawn, zwoh-nikh-law-nee. E-e-t-nee-awng, nawn-width-aw-nee-naw..."
repeated several times. This section proved to be a very tough nut
to crack: it took four issues of the _Newsletter_ before Kate took
pity on the fans (none of whom was able to guess all twelve words
of the two-sentence message that, we were told, began with the
word "Don't") and allowed the correct answer to be published. It was:

     "Don't ignore, don't ignore me. Let me in and don't be long."

   Exactly what sort of weirdness Kate perpetrated to create the
message's unique sound has never been explained by her or anyone
else, but there is more or less unanimity among fans now that whatever
the method was, the solution was decidedly anti-climactic.
   See, this is the sort of thing that passes for humour among the
Bush family-members. For five years they no doubt had regular chuckles
over the image of Kate's myriad minions poring hour after hour over their
turntables seeking the answer to a puzzle the solution to which had
essentially no point...
