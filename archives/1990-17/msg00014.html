Another thought:

Gee, I guess I'm the last person who should be all pretentious and uppity
about musical taste because I love The Shaggs, and they're the second worst
group in the history of the universe. Plus, I just paid good money for an
album by THE worst group in the history of the universe--Shonen Knife.
Guess what? I knew what they sounded like before I bought the LP (at least
I didn't buy the CD, I had it in my hands though) and knew how bad they
were! The group is 3 women from Japan and they're so bad that they make the
Shaggs sound like they're ready for Carnegie Hall!
They have a massively small cult following, especially in Los Angeles, where
a bunch of punkers got together and recorded an album of Shonen Knife
cover songs. It's got to be better than the original versions but I went
ahead and got Shonen's album anyway. I haven't listened to the entire thing
yet. I can only take a few second at a time. God help me if I ever get to
actually really like it! Then again, that's what I said about The Shaggs :-)

The trip to the store was more than worthwhile though because I bought a
great album by the group West India Company called "Music From New Demons".
More about this in another post. I also bought a Pylon album and a 12" by
The Sugarcubes with 3 different versions of the song "Planet", just in time
for my "Around The Universe" show.

All of The Pogues but especially...um....oh...well...all of them

Lene Lovich                             "New Toy EP"

I could go on &amp; on (aren't you sorry you asked :-) and not even scratch the
surface. There's so much more I have yet to discover too.
The point is that there is SO MUCH GREAT music out there and I probably
haven't even heard a fraction of it. When people complain that there's no
good music to listen to I shake my head in sorrow. I honestly pity people
who don't know about, don't want to know about or can't "hear", good music.
Especially if their tastes are so narrow that they can't abide/be bothered
with anything but one particular style of music.
In every genre, in any era, there's good stuff to be discovered. 

It's fun to find! (expensive, but fun!)
