&gt;I'm not involved in this, and Chris and I generally don't fight each
RobH has told me by email that the tools the angels use in the film are indeed
from the "Golden Dawn" tradition, namely : Raphael - staff, Gabriel - cup,
Michael - sword, Uriel - orb.

&gt;&gt; The way I see it, you (Chris) are saying

&gt;[Chris] does *not* think she's a "cretin" and it *wrong* for you to
&gt;put such a word in his mouth. 
 
Okay, I guess I didn't make myself clear.  I'm *NOT* saying that
	Chris said ...
but rather
	Chris' post made me react as if he had said ...
 
&gt;&gt;That explains it.  Having been brought up around people who use "fake
&gt;&gt;paranormal" events to make a living undoubtedly closed your mind to the
&gt;&gt;possibility that such events may exist.
 
&gt;"...to make a living..."? Reading that, I can't help but imagine that no 
&gt;*real* psychic, fortune-teller, medium, yadda, would *ever* consider "making
&gt;a living" off their "talents." 
 
I'm saying that magicians make a living out of fooling people with 
sleight-of-hand tricks.  Chris is saying that there *CANNOT* be any
real mediums etc. which I don't agree - I think there are, possibly, people
with real supernatural powers; I give them the benefit of a doubt.
 
&gt;Mr. Williams didn't "make a living" from being a magician. He was a cop ...
 
Alright, I made a mistake by inferring "My dad was a magician" to mean 
"My dad was a professional magician".
 
&gt;I personaly don't
&gt;think [Chris] has a closed mind at all, he just refuses to take the paranormal
&gt;and supernatural on faith alone.
 
Well, since I do not know Chris personally, I can only judge him from the
posts, which *to me* sound arrogant and condescending, and deny the existence 
of the supernatural completely.
 
This will be my second and last post on this subject.  (Unless I have to
publicly apologize for any new mistakes I made :-O )
