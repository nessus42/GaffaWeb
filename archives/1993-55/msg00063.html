Hi!

In response to Chris Williams' idea about the KBC hiring out a firm to take
care of US mass mailings:  Trust me, it would be a LOT more money than it
would be worth.

I work for a marketing company that sometimes handles fulfillment (silly
term for Shit You Mail Out When People Ask For It), and the charges can
get really high, especially when the fulfillment house (Place That Mails
Said Shit Out) needs to make a profit to stay in business.  For example,
let's take a single-page mailing announcing the release of a new single.
The fulfillment house would charge per page for the announcement, probably
$0.04-$0.05 per page.  Then they would charge for stuffing and addressing
the envelopes (the KBC might even have to hire somebody to put all the
addresses on stick-on labels, if they don't have that already), probably
an extra cent or two per, then on top of that you would have the postage:
X times $0.29.

When you add it up that doesn't seem to be all *that* much, but then figure
that most fulfillment houses also have a minimum charge, and the KBC would
have to get all the materials over to the US, and and and.

As for the KBC taking credit cards, every time you whip out your MasterCard,
the store/company you're paying has to shell out for the pleasure- from
authorization to usage fee, it can add up.  Plus you have an initial outlay
for opening the merchant account necessary to support credit cards and getting
the materials you need to work with.  Again, not worth it, especially for a
non-profit outfit like the KBC that produces little to no worthwhile product
anyway.

Just thought I'd lety'all know what would be involved there.
