&gt;&gt;Pretty basic stuff here.  Kate (or Kate's character in the song)
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

&gt;*Thank you* for saying that. I *personally* (as in IMHO) think that
&gt;it's a "character" is who is singing. Not that I'd care if Kate's into
&gt;this stuff for real. It doesn't matter to me. The only thing that
&gt;would make me drop Kate is if I found out she was a Scientologist.
&gt;(which I've never even heard a hint about, so there's no reason
&gt;to start a thread about it.) 

Thank Goddess for that!  &gt;8)  I try to be a minimalist as far as
these things go, so unless Kate calls me up or walks in my door
and says, "Yes, Rob, I am an occultist, and you may quote me on
that," then I want to allow for all possibilities.  (Yes, I do still
think she is, but as you said, it's a personal assumption.)

&gt;&gt;order!  Many people on alt.magick have discussed this.  One person
&gt;&gt;has pointed out that if Kate is facing west and standing upside
&gt;&gt;down, then everything works out the same.  There's another
&gt;&gt;explanation, though.

&gt;There is, you know, a third explanation. Kate just read this stuff
&gt;about Michael &amp; Gabriel &amp; whoever, and it was wrong, and she didn't
&gt;know any better, and wasn't into it enough to *seriously* research
&gt;it, and put it in the song that way, not realizing that it would
&gt;cause massive discussion amongst pagans who *are* into it.

That's another possibilty I had considered.  A fourth one, and the
first one I thought of, is that Kate decided that the name Gabriel
sounded better in a song, and put it first for musical reasons.


&gt;Kate knows *enough* about Wicca to know something about that ritual,
&gt;but IMHO she just used it in the song, and there just isn't enough
&gt;evidence to say that she actually practices the religion or ritual.

Whoa there, back up a step.  I don't want anyone misquoting me on this.
This is NOT NOT NOT a Wiccan ritual, this is a Golden Dawn/Western
Mysteries ritual.  I'm just a Wictch/occultist who happens to use it.

&gt;Vickie (who doubts that Kate is "into" incest just because she wrote
&gt;"The Kick Inside")

&gt;8)  Good one!
