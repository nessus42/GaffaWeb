Hi, it's David here (you know, the one who posted that first "name your 
five fave artists" post).  The response has been incredible!  You know, 
it might not be a totally Kate-related topic, but interesting none the 
less.  

I'll just tell you a bit about myself, as I'm *fairly* new around here, 
having first subscribed to LoveHounds a little over a month ago and 
usually a lurker.

I was first introduced to Kate Bush in 1991.  A friend was playing "Under 
Ice" and "Waking the Witch" in his car and I was mesmerized!  "Who is 
this woman?" I asked him, and once he told me, I knew that before long 
I'd own all her CDs.  

Anyway, he copied his CDs for me onto tape and I played them over and 
over till they'd worn out.  I think "The Ninth Wave" got the most 
airplay!  (Until I actually bought the CD, I was sure "Under Ice" and 
"Waking the Witch" was one song!)

I bought the "This Woman's Work" boxed set in 1994, and I play it over 
and over.  I love it- (I just couldn't respond to the 5 worst Kate songs, 
because they all occupy a special place in my heart).  The Hounds of Love 
and The Kick Inside get the most airplay.  I find The Kick Inside is 
really good to listen to just before going to sleep.  Something about the 
whale song at the start, and the soothing quality of the final song...

My fave Kate songs (in no particular order) are:
The Jig of Life
Under Ice/ Waking the Witch (I know, it's 2 songs, but I can't separate them)
Lord of the Reedy River
Under the Ivy
Leave it Open (I love the bit where it gets heavy!)
Lily
The Song of Solomon
Cloudbusting
Love and Anger
Deeper Understanding (I turn to my computer...)


Well, I could go on, but I won't.

Peace,
David.
