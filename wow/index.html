    <P>Welcome to WOW: The Images of Kate Bush. Images are constantly being
      added, and eventually there will be hundreds here. Right now, there are
      approx. 350+, which should keep those who love looking at the many faces
      of Kate busy for a while. </P>
    
    <P>You have a choice in how to view these images, and what sizes to view.
      You can &quot;flip through&quot; the regular pages or you can cheat with
      the tiny thumbnails. You can also, if you already know the ID # of the
      image you're looking for, go to the Images page guide and find that image
      by its number. </P>
    
    <P>The regular pages have 4-5 images per page. The images are larger than
      normal thumbnails, and are almost all gifs, and they all link to giant
      images (gifs or jpgs, mostly jpgs). Sizes of the giant images generally
      range from 20 to 90k. A handful are in the 100,000-300,000+ range, but
      their smaller counterparts have borders around them, and are also
      specifically marked for Lynx users, so you'll be forewarned before
      clicking on a particular image.</P>
    
    <P>Images 100k-200k are marked with a one pixel border, images 200k-300k
      are marked with a 4 pixel border and images over 300k are marked with an 8
      pixel border. </P>
    
    <P>The &quot;tiny thumbnails&quot; pages have very small jpgs on them, with
      around 50 thumbnails to each page. Each page might take a bit to load up,
      but if you're looking for a specific image, it's a quicker way to find it
      than looking for it on the regular pages. As with the regular pages, each
      tiny is linked to its giant counterpart, and images over 100k are marked
      with the borders as listed above. A number beside each tiny jpg is linked
      to the page containing the gif image, in case you want to see or get that
      too. </P>
    
    <P>Enjoy!</P>

    <P>Note:
      <BR> So far, everything comes from a private collection, and I still have
      a few hundred more to scan in and add. Eventually, I'll start adding
      images from other people's collections, and those will be credited as
      such. </P>
    
    <P>These images come from many different places, ranging from the covers of
      music releases, to magazine photo spreads to newspaper clippings. Quality
      varies widely, since I don't actually have the &quot;real&quot; photos
      available. Needless to say, these images are here without permission from
      the photographers, but that's not why they're not credited. I just haven't
      had time to add credits or sources. </P>
